I'll be dancing with the stormy sea.
   Dm                  C                           G
If you lose me,  just come looking I'm not hiding.

Dm                                     F               G
I thought that I was talking, but it was only noise.
 Am                            Em
And now I'm left alone, how empty are my hands.
Dm                                           F                          G

Dm                                    F                     G
But if you keep on dancing you have nothing to fear.
Am                                    Em
And if you stick around you'll be happy that you did.
   Dm                                        C                     G

In instinct he's blind as a mole.
F             Am          C      Em  Am
He'll be a sad crazy lonely old fool.

feel your feelings and never get paid.

(verse 1)
    Bm
There aint no work so I sing my song.
There aint no right so I do it all wrong.
There aint no hope and only shit floats
I was born among sheep but I live among goats

And it's a looooong waaaaay to heaven
When you're living iiiiiin   hell
I'd be glad to live in your garden
If you don't mind the smell.

(chorus)

(verse 2)
I'm a carnie at heart yes I cook like that
I used to be a preacher but I sold my hat
I had twenty seven jobs but none of them now
And if you keep a straight face I'll let you tell me how

to liiiiiive without hating life.
we're all pigs and chickens and god's got a knife.

(chorus)

Gotta stop runnin from my college loans.  gotta pay off my two cell phones.gotta make my way and find a spot and not stop runnin til the wheels fall off.  It's a long way to heaven when you're livin in hell.  I'd be glad to live in your garden if you dont mind the smell.  Once again I'm runnin on a borrowed roll, counting all the things that I can't quite hold, once again I'm fallin down a rabbit hole and once again i don't really know, and so we walk dont run, baby dwell in the shade, feel your feelings and never get paid.  Listen to the sun baby talk to the rain.  Feel your feelings and never get paid.
Because sugar, and gasoline.  old enemy friend, tell me where have you been.

Say sugar, and gasoline.  Mama don't come home with me.

Verse 1

Scrape ah da frosting, off your cake.  And put it in your gas tank.

'cause nothin is sacred, no one is sane, Mama don't come home with me.

It's a complicated mixture of delusion and hope.  I aint got no gas but I'm on a slope.  I'm a resonating chamber that resounds with fear, but at least I'm still here.
The cars roll by and the wind still blows.  picked up hitch hikin by a guy named joe.  I pray there's more out there than these humans know, 'cause otherwise I'm alone.




8     THE BOY WHO COULD NOT SIT STILL

          Am
He was the boy who could not sit still.

They had to feed him pills

But it did not go down well,

'cause he was only still when they broke his will.


C - A7 - B7#3#5 - A7

Am
Now the boy just won't move.

say's there's nothing he wants to do.

the pills only gave him proof

that if you can't sit still you're alive in well.

It's just another bus,           with all the conversations   I'm not part of.

And the girl at the front, she turned around and she looked at me just once,

And the guy at the back, won't stop telling me that my song is whack.

(chorus)

It's just another bus,  It's just, another bus oh yeah.

It's just another bus,  It's just, another, bus.

Verse 2

And the guy on my left, with the hot sticky breath looks at me so seriously and says

I knew a guy whose wife died, he wouldn't let go he taped open her eyes.

I knew a guy whose wife died, he wouldn't let go he taped open her eyes.

Strapped up in a chair with a vacant stare, didn't take long to see that nothin was there.

I knew a guy whose wife died, just another fucked up conversation from the bus.

(chorus)

Verse 3

A professor of philosophy, is talkin to a farmer, right behind me.

In their discussion, road kill is a metaphor.  I lean back, act natural and listen for more.

A little chicken is trying to cross the road,

his little chicken feet are in the street but nobody slowed.

Than a Mack truck hit the chicken head on.

his little chicken feet are in the street but chicken is gone.

Send you roses, Send you fire.  Send you every metaphor for for, for my desire.

(verse 1)

Just last week, I saw you on the bus.

There must have been a dozen sweaty people, oh sitting between us.

I didn't get a chance to meet you but I did get off at your stop.

Crouched down behind a trashcan and I watched which way you walked.

(chorus)

(verse 2)

Than this week, while you were out of town,
I crept in through your doggy doggy door and I had a look around.
Didn't take nothing but the pictures on my phone
Possibly a pair of panties or three, and than I slipped quietly ho-ome.

12.            JOIN THE CIRCUS

Join the circus with me.
We can set all the animals free.
We can feed LSD to the clowns,
Join the circus with me, and we can leave...   this town.

There'll be lots of funny jobs to do.  Give the painted man a new tattoo.
Some of the jobs might be kinda wierd, one of us'll have to trim, the fat lady's beard.

13   NOTHIN EVER CHANGES
Nothin ever changes, no one ever grows nothin you could ever do to find out the way it really goes.  So don't ask me to scream out loud. Only one thing I can say.Send it all back to hell I don't want to deal with that shit today.

14.  BART SONG
Distant whispers promise a train and it'll come,  barreling along.Slowly screaming, rising along the tunnel...   adn than it's upon you.
beneath the noise the overhead voice takes a chance     to say what it wants...Rumble on, children of this godless whisper.  rattle and hum with the rest of 'em. I carry you along, and you listen to my mournful song of marble and rails and tunnels and tales of what goes on in this belly of mine.  Rumble on sweet children rumble on.

15     I'll Be Gone / WROTE A SONG

(intro)
I wrote a song for you.  'Cause that's what you said you wanted me to do.
I wrote a happy tune, but you weren't around so I sang it to the moon.
I wrote a song for you.  I wrote a song for you.

(chorus)
I'll be gone for the next few days.  I can't explain why I feel this way.
Life's a game I don't like how you play.  So I gotta go for the next few days.

(Verse 1)
You said you love me, and I know it's true.  But it's not the way that I love you.
You said you love me and you'll never leave, I guess that makes me your favorite squeeze.

(chorus)

(verse 1)
You said we match like the sun and the moon.  We made love in your bedroom.
You looked at me with bright blue eyes.  That was the first time I wanted to die.

(chorus)



16             ON THE FIRST DAY OF SHIT

On the first day of Summer we dance til we die.
On the first day of Winter, we teach crows to fly.
On the first day of Spring, we let strangers in and
On the first day of Fall we do nothing at all.

17            ROB YOUR JOB

I gotta, sneak the meat home under the beans.
Maybe slide a little cheese in between
ah oh, don't show your face yet.  I'll tell you when.


18        You Don't Know Me

You don't know me, and I don't care, You don't know me and I don't care.
I aint gonna get a job, and I won't cut my hair, cause you don't know me and I don't care.


19       SUCH A LONG DAY

It's been such a long day, can't remember this morning.
Such a long day I forgot where I'm going.
Such a long time, I'm losing my mind.
Such a long long lonely day.

20      I STOLE JESSES HOMEWORK
I stole Jesse's homework, even though he's only nine.  I stole jesse's homework, so I could crawl inside his mind and maybe just die.
21 CHEESEBURGERS
Dont gimme no cheeseburgers I want a filet mignon.  Dont gimme no cheeseburgers, I want a filet mignon.
22. See The People
See the people, running to and fro.  Always on their way but never knowing where they go.  See the people running hurry scurry fast, none of them are first and none of them are last.

23. Kowboy Kyle

Kowboy Kyle died in battle with his boots on.  Kowboy Kyle died in battle wiht his boots on.  I saw him in his coffin and he looked up at me and said, are you sure?  I don't feel dead, and I said, kowboy kyle, you're in denial.  You're as dead as dead can be.  Kowboy Kyle died in battle with his boots on.
(spoken)Kowboy Kyle sat on the steps of a large brick building.  The sun was setting, and he meant to roll himself a cigarette.  As he did, a security guard approached him and said "There is no loitering on these premeses.  Kowboy Kyle looked up at him and said "Draw." the security guard said "What?" as Kowboy Kyle drew and shot him in the neck the arm the leg the chest and the head, and the man fell dead.  (REPEAT CHORUS)
(spoken)At the sound of the shot, a crowd of guards came running and surrounded Kowboy Kyle who sat calmly smoking.  "FREEZE!"  They shouted.  "Dont MOVE!"  and Kowboy calmly responded.."Draw
24. See You Every Day
I see you every day.  You're wawiting on the world to change.  I see you every day.  You're waiting for the world to change.  Can't you see its a beautiful day?  Can't you see it changes evefry day?

Some need reason, some need rhyme.  Tis the season to lose your mind.

Follow me into the cave.  You cannot spend what you have not saved.

Some want trues, and some want lies.  There's more than one way to get lost inside.

Save your face at the cost of your soul,  Life is empty, I cannot be full.

Rage, raggedy belief, breaking life, shattering my knees

When will I let me be?  When will I let me be?

What's Next

A	D
I never claimed to know what I was doin.
E 	A
But I didn't mean to lead you into this mess.
A	D
So sorry babe, but I think I must be goin.
E	    A
But you're welcome to follow me over this fence.


No Further West

Spider crawl across your brain.  Medication doesn't make you sane.

Find a tool to fix your hole.  Find an emptiness to fill your soul.

Because i cannot walk away.  And I know this is not my pain.

So why do I stay around and feel, when I know that whiskey is the way to heal.

Because it is not in my brain,  and medication doesn't make you sane.

Echo inside.  Don't touch the walls. Welcome inside, and I don't even care at all.

Welcome, to the wall of the cave.  Meet the master, meet the slave.

And my friend, don't touch the walls. Or you'll find there's nothin there at all.

Welcome to the mess.  We can go no further west.

Welcome to the West.  Aint no sayin what comes next.


Cannot Hold This

(chorus)    I cannot hold this in my head.  I cannot keep it from my everything.

Why do we never hold the reins?  We only choose the type of sin we're in, sin we're in.

Verse 1

I quit the cult, and i joined the army.  I traded religion for a political party.

I quit my girl, 'cause porn doesn't cry.  I quit the song, 'cause I can't remember why I ever cared.

--------------------
He trails off and lets the artifact slip from his hand.  A group of monks walks past singing:.

There Really Isn't Much

There really isn't much, to talk about.   The world is fucking up in its old familiar way.

There really isn't much to talk about,  THe world is finding ways, to not go home.

There really isn't much tot alk about,  The world is fucking up in it's old familiar way.

FIRST INTERMISSION

     Scatterbrain Mezzanie

Disappear, into the scatterbrain mezannie.  Disappear into the thoughts of what you'll never be.

Softly disappear into the swell,  Softly disappear into the swell...

Welcome to the scatter brain mexannie.  The thoughts are all that you can see.

Wecome to the scatterbrain mexannie.  Please find your way through the sky...

PART 2 : A Certain Amount of Broken Is Applied
         Rattle Machine

(chorus)  We must unravel this rattle machine. Find out where this poor fool has been

and all the glorious horror he's seen.

He sees a face, yes it keeps coming up on our charts.  Yes it must be quite close to his heart.

Yes, he relaxes when we ask him what it means.  We must unravel this rattle machine.
(chorus)

Kill the power, his logic spins out of control.  In instinct he's blind as a mole.

He'll be a sad crazy lonely old fool.  We must unravel...

(chorus)
When The Smoke Cleared

The inner shit storm is starting to kick into gear.

The glorious tumult of torturous words are in my ears.

Oh, the rattling twist won't be missed when it's gone.

And the splattering mist of false logic, and all my dead mental skin pours into this song.

When the smoke cleared I was alone.  And I knew I would never find my way home.

When the truth was lost, I could not let it go.  And when the smoke cleared, I was alone.


Soft Sweet and Delicate Mind

I will dismantle you and eat you a piece at a time.

Saving for last your soft sweet and delicate mind.

In the past I lost and laughed and lost again.

Saving for last my soft sweet and delicate mind.

  Warm Full Belly

G7	C
I got a warm full belly of smelly spaghetti,

feet still bare I left my shoes at a party.

It's one of those moments where I can't decide if I care...

I'm riding on a turtle and you're losing your hair, and I just don't care because I know that I'll get there.

You tell me that I'm losing and I should be sad.  You're winning but you're mad, so I prefer to lag.


All You Know

All you know is where you've been  and all you can see is what's in your head...

and all you know is where you've been my friend.


Sick and Sad

He said we're all a little sick and sad inside, we're all a little sick and sad.

Aint no such thing as good or bad, we're just all a little sick and sad.

(Wierd Mumbly First Verse)

He said we're all a little sick and sad inside, we're all a little sick and sad.

It won't even matter when you're dead, you'll still be sick and sad inside.

And don't even bother askin why...

We're all a little sick and said inside.

We're all a little burnt and oh so dry,

We're all a little  da de da, sick and sad inside.


              SECOND INTERMISSION

           Patterns In the Sand

Tracin patterns in the sand.  Scream your noise into the wind.

Let it all just fall down into the mess that it is.

PART 3 : Visions of a Cold Gray Future

Tall Cold Lady in the Cotton Gray Suit

Do you have a permit for you suit sir, for your expressions and your point of view sir?

Do you need to be told what to do sir?  Very well sir, follow me.

Have you ever contemplated truth sir?  Did you pursue a reckless youth, sir?

Please step into this booth, sir.  Remove your body hair.  You see, we're quite sanitary.

(chorus)

Because it's functional here.  Without God, there is no fear.

And won't you all please lend an ear, to the tall cold lady in the cotton gray suit.

You see, it's functional hear.  Without God there is no fear.

So won't you all please lend an ear, to the tall cold lady in the cotton gray suit.


    Permutations

We're all permutations of a human condition.

Yeah whatever you're missing is in your neighbor's kitchen.

    But Not the Way You Do
Because the world doesn't deal with pain, no not the way you do.

No, the world doesn't deal with pain, not on the same scale.

You got problems with your heart.  Yeah, it hurts every time that you fart.

Your kids all hate you, no women will date you, and your world is fallin apart,

yeah, the world doesn't deal with pain, no not the way you do.

No the world doesn't deal with pain, not on the same scale.

 Time Now

(spoken)
Who are you?  How did you get in the studio?!
Get him!  Get his legs!
No!  No!
Woah, dude…
No!  Lemme go!
Hey, I saw that guy in the paper.
What are we doing here, guys?

(sung)

It's time now, to find out. What waiting, what comes next.

It's time now, to find out.  It's time now, for the big test.

Yeah, won't you say.  Won't people come and  la la la la la la la la la la la la la

It's time now to find out how things go.

Never gonna be the time now, to see what we can do,

It's time now, to inflict my self on you.

It's time now to make a little noise and find out what happens.

oh, yeah.  Woah, woah, woah dow da down da down.

Oh, yeah, have a little noise.

It's time now, to look around.

It's time now, to stretch your voice and point your face outward, outward, outward.

It's time now to find out how it goes.  It's time now to put the water through the hose.

It's time now, to get back to the cave.   Welcome to the cave.

It's time, it's time it's time.  It's time to lick the sky,

Music is just an excuse to make noise.

Music is just an excuse to make noise.

Music is just.  Music is Just.

Noooooooooooooooise.


                                   NEW GENES



               DISC 1
1. WHOS GONNA HOLD YOU TONITE
Who's gonna hold you tonite?  There's nothin you can do to make it right.
2. WHEN DID YOU LEAVE ME

When did you leave me?  How was I to know?
I never said that you need me, 'cause I never wanted you to know.

And now you're go-o-one, and I suppose you're free.

but I did not write you this so-o-ong, no this one goes out to me.

I said fuuuuuuuck the world.  Don't ever try to find it in the eyes of a girl.
I said fuuuuuuuck the world.  It's jsut a smelly fuckin oyster without any pearl.

3. WE DONT KNOW ANYTHING
There's one thing I know and I've known since day one, and that is that we don't know anything.

      FROBISHER

Verse 1

Frobisher landed his catamaran on the shores of hoobity joo.

He'd eaten the sails and the sailors too and his voyage was finally through.

And the sun was out and the sand was hot,

And the sea was calm and Frobisher was not.

Oh, no...

(no chorus, instead instrumental break)


     BREAD AND CHEESE


All I really need is some bread and cheese, a woman to please, and a dog.

But we're out of cheese, and my woman has needs, and my dog, oh don'cha know has fleas.



    FLOWERS WERE NEVER MEANT TO FLY

Cynics talk, and lovers die, and flowers were never meant to fly.

Chickens talk and buzzards die, and flowers were never meant to fly.

Verse 1

Broken stem, a pistel popped.  Drunk again, we never stop.

You lost your pollen to the falling motion. Broken stem, and you can never be here again.


    GOT A GOOD RAMBLE

You think you got a good ramble, think you know all the lines.

You say that you were born ahead of your time.

   HEY LITTLE BUG

Hey little bug I been watching you.  On the pavement lookin for something new.  hey little bug, don't be on my hand.  hey little bug, we'll do the best we can.  Now don't you worry about a thing.  Though it may seem deranged.  Hey little  bug, what's your point of view?  Hey little bug, it's just me and you.  Don't be affraid, dont be affraid, don't be afffraid.  Hey little bug, you hesitate to roam, doesn't mean we're not the same, doesn't mean I'm not to blame.
ONE THING I KNOW / COLLOQUIALISMS
There's one thing I know and I've known since day one, and that is that we dont know anything.  There's one thing I know and I've known since day one, and that is that we dont know anything at allllllllllll.  Our colloquialisms and adages have been replaced with bumperstickers and buzzwords.  Our masters and mystics with experts and consultants.
IT DONT GO RIGHT
It dont go right.  It don't go according to plan.  Numb lung, no sight.  We're young, this is all that we can... do to feel right.  do to feel sane.  do to feel good again.  So off through the night, into the woods my friend, what comes will bite, but your life wont end.  It don't go right.  It don't go according to plan...


I HOPE YOU MISS ME
I hope you miss me, even though I don't miss you.  I hope you wanna kiss me even though that's the last thing that I wanna do.

ALL THE LEGENDS ARE DEAD
All the legends are dead.  All the love is gone.  Left out in a field they fled leaving nothing but a culling song.

THE ONLY TRUE SONG
When you smile your teeth show.  When you fake it I really cant tell.
??? SUMMER 2012 ????

1. Child Of Chaos
She'll measure your motives with a mischevious grin.  She'll give you the key but she wont let you in.  She's a Child off chaos.  She came here to play us.  She's a child of chaos, too late to call the game off.
She'll terminate your magistrate and send you on your way.  Everything you think is real, feel it peel away.  She's a child of chaos.  she came here to play us.  She's a child of chaos.  Too late to call the game off.  Child of chaos, lost in the day.  Fade between flavors, but never pay.
2. Why Do Ya
Why do ya treat me like ya do?  Why do ya play me like a fool?  These games have got me growin old.  I chose you over money now you won't be poor.
3. Riddle Me Rambler
Its in the way that you laugh all the rust out.  Itching and twitching you rattle the dust out.  Heaving and pulling you rape conversation.  Back and forth chatter you can't stop your pacing.  Riddle me rambler, what are you chasing?  Screw punctuation and no need for spacing.
Reel in strangers and dance with their day.  In the glimmer off meeting you loiter at play.  In the random the running the whim of the way.  Transition is purpose, stagnation is gray.
Left right or straight no direction is wrong.  Destination is close but you make it take long.  Improvisation will make this a song, and if life is a fork that sir, you are the prong.

4. Ten Scents
Ten scents used to be enough.  Back than that's all there was.  Back than, that's all there was.  back than, that's all there was.  There was cat and grass, blackberry and gasoline.  orange and earth, coffee adn cleaning.  The smell of them, the smell of home.  back than, that's all there was.
5. Water
This is not a riverbank, these are not ripples.  Wishing a little water might fall and make some liquid stipples.  this is not a hand I'm holding, this is not a whisper.  The only time I missed a train is when I didn't kiss her.
6. Pattern Repitition
Pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition.  I saw the moon through a window in your room in a poster on the wall at a thrift store basement sale.
I know the rain from a picture of a glade on the baja gulf in fall in the mens room of a bar on broadway.  pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition pattern repitition.  I know you from all the things we used to do not together but the same and now here we are nowhere.
7. Theory Down Down
There was a hole in a theory so I fell in, down down.  they tried to show me the fear they were sellin, down down, And so we give in to gravity, to bring us back to reality.
And now your logic is paper thin, and your singing is just a din,
phrasing changes as comfort falls, and the words dont help at all.
8 Apocalypse Winds
chord organ carols herald falling fat cats.  occupying the cover of times all the losers you laughed at.  flaunting fragmented dividends.  We give in to apocalypse winds.
Hum a dirge or two for me, give your point off view to me.  Turn my brain to mutiny.  It will not stay true to me.  Frown on my financial sins.  We give in to apocalypse winds.
My faith will not hold true to me, I don't stand up to scrutiny.  I'll accept whatever you prove to me despite all that you do to me.  Knowing we cannot begin again.  We give in to apocalypse winds.
9. Impersonate
Impersonate the person you once knew you could be but when you break your spirit don't come howling to me.
A crash course in bluffing is all that I can give.  Not a reason or the right way to live.
10. Failure Freak
Oh, sometimes I'm a failure, sometimes I'm a freak.  When I feel like I'd like to feel ya, I feel so filthy I can't speak.
11. Woke Up Late
Well I woke up late and I stared at the wall.  Wanna do nothin, nothin at all.  It's early spring, but I'm feelin the fall of man.  Well the sun is out and the birds are too.  Everyone else has got something to do.  But all I really want is a guitar in my hand.
Oh watch it rise and watch it fall, but in the end we're left with nothing at all.
so I wake up late and I stare at the wall.  Wanna do nothin.  Nothin at all.  It's early spring, but I'm feelin the fall of man.
12. When it All Comes Down
When it all comes down, you dont wanna be caught hangin around.  Better live on the mountain or live underground when it all comes down.
13. Love in the Grave
I used to flip straight to the funnies.  Now I loiter on first page.  You tell me that I need some money, I tell you that you need to be saved.  Polly tricks will be sent running, because God is no slave.  You promised me something stunning, you call it perfect, I call it paved.
14.     GUILTY FRIENDS

So don't you tell me bout your guilty friends or how it is they live their lives.
Theirs is theirs and mine is mine at least until the day I die.

Could be my friends it could be my mind it could be my fucking diet,
I may be wrong but my brain rumbles on, and the logic trail just won't die.

All I know is what has come before, and patterns that repeat themself.
Because I smell destruction in the air, and the sulfurous winds of hell.
15. If You Wanna
If you wanna, we could ffind a new way to keep fallin, off fthe edge of the page into a brand new game.  when the road calls your name you wont never be the same.
16. Tomorrow
I always knew that yesterday was gone.  it didn't matter it just made me laugh.  Now they tell me that today is in the past!  It's been tomorrow since the day you were born!

17. What's Going Around
You live in an image, I live in a sound.  No one can tell you what's going around.  We live in the places we build in our minds.  No one can help you make up your own lines.

18. I Don't Miss You
I don't miss you, but I miss the things that you said.  I miss the thoughts that you put in my head.  I miss the smell that you left in my bed.

19. Pretend
She said will you pretend to be a stranger?  I don't wanna remember.  I said yeah yeah yeah.
Will you  pretend to be a lawyer?  See, I wanna sue my neighbor.  I said yeah, yeah, yeah.
Will you pretend to be a doctor?  I don't wanna lose my finger.  I said...

20. The Realms
The Realms have all been compromised.
We've lost the calmness in our eyes.
We punctuate our words with sighs,
the fire inside us dies.
We try to pry right through the lies, the things inside they flower and die.  We rise up crying , how to fly?  as the fire inside us dies.

MEARSHIRE SPRING 2012

1. Natty Green
Natty Green didnt quite make it into history.  Natty Green didn't quite make it into history.  He was the quarter master man at valley forge for washington's horde of rebel soldiers.  Rebel soldier bare feet in the snow til Natty green, he put a boot on his toe.  Natty green didn't quite make it into history.  Natty Green didn't quite make it into history.
2. Mad Scientist
'cause he's a mad scientist.  Wont you sponsor his monster?  Sponser my monster.  With enough money he will build your wish.  Won't you sponsor his monster.  Sponser my monster.  Do you have a dream he could add to his list, or will you sponsor his monster?  Sponsor my monster.  He'll bringg you all the things that don't exist if you sponser his monster.  sponser my monster.
3. We are Young
We are young, but we feel so old.  We seek out the sun because it seems so cold.  it's comin, but it's not clear why we've landed here.
4. One Job One Boss
One job, one boss.  One problem one cause.  One method one mind.  One project one time.  One reason to be three people you see, a fforeman can do, nothing without at least another two.  One way we an see the things we can be, a swing needs a rope, a tire and a tree.
5. One Rip Two Tore
I got one rip two tore three bloody knuckles.  Rain so heavy it's comin down in buckles.  Feet numb nose wet eyes a little buggy.  Coffee got cold so I might as well chug it.
There's a river and a creek and a floodplain pond.  It was a field 'fore the rain, but it didn't last long.  THere's a farmer and a wife and a purdy litle baby, and a musical type getting over bein crazy.
It's a long way out, not much to do.  so don't come out til you're ready to.  There's room for all, but not for your mood.  Sometimes it's polite to be rude.
6. A Way to Be
Oh, there's a way to be.  Livin life always on your sleeve.  Off the cuff just the way you breath.  Yeah, that's the way to be.
7. Side Effects
We are side effects of the information age.  Bi-products of the century brain.  No way to stop, no time to explain.  Feel us rearrange.
8. The Coffee
Must have been something else other than me.  Must have been the coffee.  Must have been something else other than me.  Must have been the coffee.  I try so hard to stop my thoughts and sleep, but my dreams are on the ceiling.  Musta been somethin else other than me.  Musta been the coffee.  Grocery market lights are as bright as interogation chamber.  Give me too many options til my own goal I don't remember.  Must abeen somethin else other than me.  Must been the coffee.

FALLING NOTES FALL 2012

LISTEN
Listen, what do you think you're missing?  look around and see what you're already missing out on.

THE RAINBOWS END

I've flown into the godless sky  before.
I've seen the rainbow's end.
Look in my eyes and you'll know why I'm smiling.
You can never go home again.

The Long Walk

The Long Walk, see me handin out lines.
The long walk, between the help wanted signs.
Fifteen towns, seven counties three states,
Thirty seven interviews in a twenty month wait.

YOu want my right hand, I'd rather lose an eye,
No use in makin a livin if it makes you want to die.
WHATS HE DOIN?
Stitchin up my shoe with a broken hairpin.  Super glue wore through, now my toe is bare again.


BURY ME / WHEN YOU GO
Bury my body in the ground and after that don't make a sound.  Bury my body and plant a tree, and than won't you please forget me.  Scatter my ashes in the creek, and after that oh, please don't speak.  Scatter my ashes and set me free, and wont you please forget me
Don't you know that when you go you wont be gone.  I'll be keepin at least a piece of you in this song.  As the trees they fan your breath u pto the sky adn the youth around your grave collect your whys, it's a rerun rut resounding howling blue.  In a sitcom bog I got lost next to you.  And if you study the pixelated membrane of the dream, you may one day know what I mean.  So throw me down a mountain.  Toss me in a stream, and listen ffor the windfall honey, I'll be back again.  And if you try to call me off the chase, you better kill the pale blue flicker in your face.  And if I leave it only written will it fade?  Because a song is not a song until it's played.  So throw me down a mountain, toss me in a stream, and listen for the windfall honey, I'll be back again.
ITS ALL IN YOUR HANDS
You're only a victim off your own decisions and the only attack is your own type of livin.
You hesitate to take the fate you yourself have created remaining pacified, sedated, satiated.
It's all in your hands so you look at your feet.
You meet their demans like a dog for a treat.
You scribble down lines to ease your mind, but in time the goal and origin,
the vector of intention has been warped and pulled unrecognizable.
BEEN GONE FOR SUCH A LONG TIME
I been gone for such a long time, I can't remember where I'm from.
I been gone for such a long time, I can't remember where I'm from.
When you look back on the past Everything is gold.
Because only the good times last.  Remember that as you grow old.
Felton Hotel
Felton Hotel, Do Tell, Do Tell.  A hundred years now, are we doin well?  Never mind, please don't tell.
You'll last the longest if you don't talk, so Felton hotel, just keep it up.
Ruth (less)
I knew a girl, a girl named RUTH.  She tell me lies, never spoke the truth.  I caught her callin dudes in a phone booth.  I cut her off COLD and now I'm RUTHLESS

I Drop
I drop lines and they break on the ground.
My words are so deep they dont make any sound.
I drop lines and they just lie on the floor.
I say words than i don't talk any more.
I spit juice if I think it's bad, because
I'm scared of it after some bad juice that I had.

Broken Peace
He's a broken piece of machinery.  Breaking Holes in the scenery.

Follow Night
Follow me into the night.  Dont you try to put up a fight.
There's things you never need to know, and that's precisely where we'll go.

What Pun
Get off my porch, you stole my pun for the last time.

Poncho (Blanket)
I had a blanket.  It got a hole in it.  I couldn't fix it so I renamed it.  Now it's a poncho.

I had a ponch. it got a stain on it. I couldn't clean it so I renamed it.  Now it's a carpet.

Because a sponge goes...   from the sink to the counter to the floor

And a cloth goes...    from the bed to the body to the floor.

Same Old Difference
How can the same place be so unfamiliar?  Why do the old ways seem so unrefined?  Our earth is our mistress and yet we still kill her.  The crisis, the cure, it's all locked in our minds.

Hard Boiled Bastard
He's  a hard boiled bastard with one wooden leg.  He says it's his girlfriend and he calls her peg.
He had split personalities Til he lost an eye. If life was a soup I'm sure he'd be the fly.
One minute he laughs, one minute he cries.  He controls the full moon and the stars in the sky.
He's a hard boiled bastard, so please don't ask why, after this many years he still seems to be alive.

Blue Monica
Blue Monica, Blue Monica, Dear sweet blue sweet monica.  When I met you I was wearin my zebra stripe shirt.  shoulda known you were trouble in your leapord print skirt.

I Dunno What I'm Doin
I dunno what I'm doin so please step back.  I can't be held responsible for bbein out of what.  Hold me down, set me  back.  Cant be held responsib oh oh.

Shanty Town Barber
Well I aint no shanty town barber, but I guess I do cut my own hair.  I practice it down at the harbor, on the raggedys living down there.  THis hobby is now quite addictive.  In my free time it's all I can do.  Recently I started in on the hippies, and my next target might be you.  I lure them in with some pot and we make some art, and when the hash makes them pass out, that's when I start.  I cut their hair offf and make wigs I sell to walmart, and if they want it back they'll have to go add it to their cart.  You used to think that you live in a world, where things just come for free, but whether you prefer life straight or curled, they charge you for what occurs naturally.

Well We Could Always
Well we could always go drink by the river adn right a ffew tunes.  We'll sing with the rapids and clog up our livers and dance with the moon.



SELF TITLED 2013

1   A NIGHT
Never seen a night that lasted so long.  Never felt so right and been sso wrong.  Never seen a stare so soft and true.  Every map I find leads right back to you.

2    So Many Engines
So many engines always turning.  Can't turn them offf they never stop.  All you can do is turn with the engine.  On wiht the turning, never stop.
Turned by the engine into a diamond, turned by the mind into energy finders. Turn with the engine diamond creation.  Turned by the energy into expression.

3  They Came Lookin
They came lookin for me but I wasn't myself.  They asked me how do you feel I said like somebody else.  So now I'm searchin for some piece of mind, but a piece of yours'll do just fine.
I surround myself with people who let me fuck up because I haven't had enough and I dont wanna rise above.  so I let it all keep fallin, watch it slide into the sea.  And I reach out to you and scream come join me.
I traded in my sanity to catch a quick buzz, because I haven't had enough and I don't wanna rise above.
And still, I keep callin.  As into nothin we keep fallin.  As we cling to the millstone, we place our brains in the killzone.

4   Noise
All these noises all this pain, anxious movements in my brain.  in this moment I must let it all, fall away.
Language and logic and no way to pause it the clock hands have claws that effectively cause it.  A shift in awareness a presence of sense, sensitivities wake as you watch it all fall away.

5Give Up the Gift
Give up the gift and let us live.  Cause not the rift or we may lose this.  channel not that immortal stuff.  Plain pleasentries are quite enough.  Pull not ffor us from that deep well, your words are pills your lectures hell.  So please just hum a pleasent tune, don't lock us up in your dark mind room.
These things are real only to you.  Life is aglow don't block the view.
Give up the gift and let us live, cause not the rift or we may lose this.

6Cash
I got a hunnerd dollar check and its from me to myself.
The ATM doesn't mind if this does not pan out well.
I tell the robot that I promise, to pay myself back.
I don't got no excess and so I give from  my lack.

Because caaaaash is one hell of a drug.
And money doesn't really exist so you can never get enough.
And caaaaash is one hell of a drug.
And money doesn't really exist so you can never get enough.

7 Young Appetites
Your apetites will eat you in the end my friend, so please, no more medicine.  If we dont resist it will begin again, so please no more medicine.
Spread the cards across me like a blanket!  Make my heart stop, I can't take it.  My body is a prop when I embrace it.  See the old charcoal cues, I can't erase it.

8 Pianecessita
Back when we all were the same, don't even try to describe that place.  Before you learned your own name, and the knowledge affected your face.  Before we knew how to blame, Before we started to pick up the pace.
Before we knew how to shame, Before we learned how to need our own space.

9 Give In
I saw a vision and I fell into a river and they showed me what a muse is and they taught me these abuses.  I had a mission but I never did begin I had a dream but only sleeping in the end I guess we all give in.

10 Energies
Orbiting these energies and channeling dysfunction.
Overcome with lethargy, soon you are one of them.
Collecting flaws like stamps and coins,
Your thoughts are overcome with noise.

11. SEASONS
How many reasons you got to be livin the life that you do?  HOw many seasons until you decide you should try something new?  It's a long way down, not much to land on, so don't step out til you got something to stand on.
12. I Cannot Adjust
Lemme just take a nap, not standing.  This is not a stable position.  No candy please, can't you see, the sweetness only makes me sleepy.  I cannot adjust!  You're back to how it was.  It's clear that we were meant to be wherever we were til we were here.  lemme just feel the lack of understanding.  This is not a proper transition.  Accent the edges with illegible meanderings.  I cannot adjust.  Tell me how it was, back before the rust turned our minds to dust...

13.  New Sheep Screaming
I cant change what I'm not part of I can't look you in the eye, and tell you all the things I thought of that might keep us both alive, because nature doesn't care and society's a game, trading clever little comforts in exchange for all your pain.  Than they bleed you til they need you not and they toss your corpse aside.  Than they plug you into batteries to make you feel alive and I scream why oh how the passive sheep are eaten live without a bleet and soft sweet vixens come and kiss their eyelids as they fall asleep to the sound of new sheep screaming, let us feast upon their meat.  We fall asleep, we fall asleep, and when we meet we do not greet and when we do we only speak to say it's such a busy week and than we leave to seek a place that's free of such unseemly freaks that we are forced to deal with daily on these once clean city streets and I scream why, oh how the passive sheep are eaten live without a bleet and soft sweet vixens come and kiss their eyelids as they fall asleep to the sound of new sheep screaming, let us feast upon their meat.

14.  The Promised Land
Tooth and jaw, lip and cheek, the truth you saw is hard to speak.
Tooth and cheek, lip and jaw, The promised land came from the fall.
Run with the fallen, sing for the dead.  Feel the calling and hear what is said.
Know in the long run we all pay the toll.  The future is empty when Mem'rys are full.
Cheek and jaw, tooth and lip, where the milk and honey drip.
Cheek and lip, jaw and tooth, the kingdom takers must be ruthless!!

15.  LET ME EXPLAIN    (song to my mom)
Let me explain myself one more time, I'm fine.
I'm not tryin to die or go blind.
I haven't lost control of my mind.
I've just lost touch with what I'm tryin to find,
But one last time, I'm fine.
Don't reinforce my doubt.  Don't say I'm the one you worry about.
I shout you cry, we pout divided, unsure why it came out like this.
Try this, please.  Now! Please, just try this. I react to where your mind is.
Faith it feeds me, doubt defeats me.  Life is made by love believing.

16. SHOW ME
(chorus)
Show me your scars and your calouses.  Show me your forts and your palaces.
Show me your trails and your hidden glens.  Show me all the ways you've given in.
(verse 1)
Now feel the rush of all you know as you give in and let it go.
Now hear the windy whisper whine as all your yesterdays lay dying.
(verse 2)
In search of silence I only find blindness, moments bloated with expectation.
Life is defined by where your mind is.  Those who know this have no hesitation.
(verse 3)
Walls of fear beneath clouds of hate, you cannot destroy what you didn't create.
So cast your eyes up out of sorrow, joyfully rise, and create tomorrow.

17. THE LIST
We refuse to lose these few truths
'cause we love it enough to not lose touch.
I had nothin to do so I made a list
of things that I otherwise might have missed.
10 things I'd like to see get done.
9 new ways the engine runs.
8 reasons I don't wanna die.
7 ways to love my life.
6 song ideas 5 new puns.
4 more ways the engine runs.
3 jobs 2 projects 1 new goal.
Now my mind is blank, but my list is full.

18. The Road    (written first walk from S.C. to Felton)
So walk on the left if you like to see what's comin.
And walk on the right if you really don't care.
I don't suggest you always hit the ground runnin
But at the same time don't just stop and stare.

19. The Dream
The dream begins to hint at an ending.
You remember you're in a bed somewhere.
Soon you know the day is impending.
A flash to choose doctor Lovejoy or mister Painfear.

20. Urban Sprawl
When can we all slow down?
Who let it become someone else's town?
You don't know who lives next door,
And even worse, your ceiling is a stranger's floor.

21. The Joiners
We call them the joiners.  They live in garages
On porches in trailers on couches in vans.
In trucks, on cots, in search on the fringes,
I'm one. I will host them in search of their land.

Farm co-op commune cult club or town,
The joiners.  We join 'cause it's human to join.

22. Exi-Seven-Count-Crisis
When you turn around again
Hoping it'll be the same
Having no one else to blame
when you learn its all a game

Living in the ampersand
Hypothetic limbo land
What you want will never be
Welcome to the usery.

23. Chaos Garden    (written behind Felton Library)
The wrinkled root is overrun.
To gnarled bark the ivy clung.
The grass it clings to dusty clod.
While sand it chokes the weaker sod.
Aloft the branches bow and bend
To winter weather, foe and friend.
In yonder fauna our eyes do stop
where fern frond feathers tempered rock.

24. Somethin in the Whatnot
You don't seem to want anything.  That used to be a good thing.
But now your down to nothin and there's somethin in the weather
that suggests you better find yourself a something.

25. Vision
I saw a vision when I fell in with the living
And they showed me what a muse is and they taught me these abuses.
I had a mission but I never did begin
I had a dream but only sleeping.  In the end we all give in.

26. The Fullness
"I'm livin life to the fullest!" You hear the fools pull this
when definin masochism in terms of false wisdom.
The fullest aint the fastest or the biggest dose
you see, fullness aint deadly.  It won't leave you a ghost.

I'm a fool for the things that I've seen and done,
But I quit quick enough that it left me young.

If you never see the ceiling until you're done drinkin,
If you only see your shoes until you get a little booze,
If you just can't talk until your third or fourth shot,
If you aint no fun unless you're tying one on,

You're a drunk!  Watch your red line.
You're a drunk!  Don't tell me you'll be fine.
You're a drunk!  And you can't quite remember.
You're a drunk!  What happened to your thunder?

LEFTOVER PARTS

POP SONGS AND RUM DRINKS

And the pop songs and rum drinks float up like dead bodies.
Neurotic insomniacs need to find hobbies.
I know that I'll never meet you in the lobby.
Before wandering out to the foriegn and false
the tears and the secrets we say in our sleep.
the feeling of leaving fa place yet we pause
For no reason why not when weo're caght in a dream,
and at last watch it fall, concrete swan of fthunder,
falling like water into the faces of strangers.
The leftover thoughts choke, caught in my throat.
A sweet breeze floats just past my nose.
Everything takes you as far as you wanna go.
Everything leads you as far as you follow.

3     THE STRANGE ONES

Go to the campus before seven bells.
That time in the morning the world turns blue.
the populous rushes to whatever they do,
and you know on the campus what it is you'll see?  Don't tell.
The strange ones.   They wander through, crowded, but few.
Their somber stretched faces burnt by the truth.

4    LIQUID NITROGEN

Now I'm awake and the wind cuts through and fuck you and this poiem.  My train of thought has been blown to shit.
and your kiss is still like liquid nitrogen.

5     AND THE DESERT DIES

Absolute half moon right above me sudeenly lonely.
tell me its not you just humoring me
But fantasy is nice sometimes when the wind is quiet and the desert dies
and the sunset sky is the pink of her thighs and the crickets begin to mimic her cries
and I feel the creatures open their eyes, and the desert dies.
In comes the soft sweet dadrkness of night as the desert comes alive with my mind.

The days'll keep coming, I guess I'll keep going to work or to school or to play.
I gues I just gotta regain my grip, and carpe this shit fucking day.

6  PROTEST LOVE

I saw your face in a protest art display.
Now you occupy my heart.

7   I DONT GO ANYMORE

There's a place I don't go anymore.
full of all the faces I don't know anymore.
They know emotions I don't show anymore
and I don't know how to get back in.

8             THE CRISIS THE CURE

How can the same place seem so unfamiliar
How can the old ways seem so unrefined.
The earth is our mistress and yet we still kill her.
The crisis the cure it's all locked in our minds.

9           FALLING CRESCENDOS OVER YOU

I don't need the reiteration off failure.
the echo pattern exposed over all the others.
falling crescendos over you
under used logics boxed in by bad habits.
I wille at you my little fucking rabbit.
my drink and hate adn my hate and drink.

And kick the burning log onto my leg.
Leftover tendencies learned ffrom a lush.
How many times til you've had enough and just won't come back?  Ffuck that.

10   I DONT WANT ANYTHING

Well I don't want anything.  least of all what you're offering me.
I don't want anything, least of all what you've given to me.

You're all filled up with your memories. tormented and morbid is how they seem.
Somehow you shrugged 'em all off onto me.
I guess I tried too hard to make you free.
You fantasize about a dead guy as you curl into me.


11        Ne-erD-Well Park

It's awefully quiet out here in the dark,
walkin alone through Ne'erD'well Park

Some say that this way is the right way.
others say that way is nice.
some say the other way is obviously the best way.
But I never take the same way twice.

Some say that loving is easier than leaving,some say that nothing is better than drugs.
Some say that living is too unforgiving, but those who don't leave behind all that they love.


19       DRUM CELLO PUNCHLINE

Everything moves towards an overwhelming harmonization.
A drum walks into a bar, two three four, tap tap tap and sees a shapely cello,
at the end of the bar.  The drum calls, the cello returns and quietly goes back to drinking.
The sax bartender laughs and gives the poor bastard drum one on the house.

20     A SECRET

I had a secret but someone else was keeping it.
I just kept leaving town.
I wont say my secret but denying it will keep it.
I've never released it so I know it's still around.

21    TO DO RAP

To Do RAP!!                      You just take a song.
And you PLAY IT!!!            Than ya add bass and drums!
Than to finish UP!!!               Just say some words.
That's RAP!!!!                         It's not that hard.

22    CRACK IN THE STREET

Call it le mor petite You're about to meet
The mutha fucka steps on every crack on every fuckin street.
Break your mother fuckin back realign your though box.
Spineless little shits in line to get off.

I didn't grow a dick so as to make new friends.
But do ya have to clarify that you're not a godsend?

23    IN SEARCH

How the beginning ended and what happened next.

I had gone in search of the future, but I left my present in the past.
So now I'm back sorting what is was and will be, what would have and might yet but hasn't.

24     MAKIN NOISE

When I was a child I used to get in trouble
For makin noise, so now I make alot  of noise.


26    JAY WALKIN

Jay walkin with a limp.  barefoot on hot concrete.
I aint go tmuch to give.  There's just too much to stop me.

27      ONCE AGAIN

Once.  Again.  Once again.
I've lost my sense of self.
Ten senses of self used to be enough.
two sides with five varieties each.


29   FOLLOWTHROUGH

He got down on his knees and begged me to reconsider.
Told me followthrough was all that I lacked.

I started every project I haven't finished.
And my ffollow through belongs to guitar.

30   BE WARY OF WILDERNESS

Bewildered.  Necessary.  Be Wary of Wilderness.
It will bury buildings In blaring wind sands
redness blending incense with air sparingly.

31   A DAY OF RECKONING

A day of reckoning looms and leers through clouds down at us as we sit here quibbling.

32   ORIGINS OF FROBISHER : NOISE VOCABLES

Frobisher discatazan Mishyoo mee sha zoo.
And on and on the noises go, frantic lost and sopping ffear.

33    ITS A MISERABLE WORLD

It's a miserable world that we live in.  It's a miserable world.  look around.
It's a miserable world, so just give in, and let it all fall down.

35      SING WITH THE MONKEYS

Well we could always go drink by the river and write a few tunes.
We'll sing with the monkeys and clog up our livers and dance with the moon.

37     IT ENDS EVERY SECOND AND STARTS AGAIN

I feel used like a bad pun or a one liner that didn't quite go over well then.
Feel the clicks and the hums and the rolling of the ball down there on the tip of my pen and.

The song ends every second and starts again.
stuck in my head like dream face a place i never been again.

38     STRANGE POKER

Why are strangers so easy to care about?
'cause when they're there they're there, when they're not they're not.

Distant twisted half hellos for people you don't know,
like playing poker for chips, it's no way to make a living.

39    THE GEESE TEQUILA

I chased the ggeese today 'cause they're worth my time!
I play to ffreaks 'cause they don't need it to rhyme.
Life aint a party it's the scene off a crime.
Love aint a mixed drink it's tequila no lime.

40     SINGED CREATURE SCREECH

Bi product of binge, our sins singed into featers,
our faces emit ths creature cscreech,
the sorrowws of self f
perpetualted by anti-pietyy
frefusing to give into self pitty, it's shitty but it's a chisce.
I keep my nose to my self, and my image of me stowed away irrelevant,
pulling out big guns of piss and vineagar to spray passer bys.

41  PUTTY FLESH

Think and think and think,  Replay
And pause, Rewind and play rewind
And Distant monster who invited you? You know I dont' believe
In you the hateful fufck fuck ffuck
I throw the lump up in my throat.
Putty flesh weeps regret, wide eyed boggled unkind.
Distant through mirrors of memory, But it was me.
Distant monster my soft monkey hands.
It got ugly.  how bad?  All the way.  The whole bucket of fuck.
Brought on chronic disease.
Til the life has been squeezed
Beauty drops to her knees making pleas
But I hate her tears cause they're not for me.

42   ALWAYS SLEEP ALONE

A mutual fuck you is a sandpaper embrace,
but it's better than hugging your knees to your chest.
Adjust to the life off society, bare your teeth.
Let your eyes smoulder through the cardigan complexion fof soft faces.
Stomp the flowers.  No roses means no thorns.
Carry a tire thumper, and the book "Fuck you in every language known"
and always sleep alone.

43       MONKEY HOWL

seventeen horses and a pig on the prowl, aint nothin in the water makin my monkey howl.

hey oh, make it all go.  away for twenty for hours or so.
Alright, tell me a lie.  Make me feel better for a day and a night.

44     FLUR DE LIS

When you find a flur de lis in the fallen elaves, come talk to me.
and all you do is breath than your love is free.

45     PLAY LOUD FOR THE WONDERFUL WASTE OF TIME

They werent allowed to play loud but they did anyway.
They played hard even though their songs weren't hard to play.

they called it a wonderful waste of time.  see you lookin into the cave.

The fear shows in your eyes as your gazin into the grave.
It's just a wonderful waste of time, for the lives we cannot save.

46   SONG FOR THE STATUE

The Statue Sings:
Oh please, pretty girl, pease give me a kiss.
The touch of a woman is something i miss.
A general once, now a stone held aloft,
But the infinite rains won't wash the pigeon shit off.
Oh please pretty girl, won't you please wipe my brow?
Physicality fades but forever is now.

The Pretty Girl Sings:
Hello old french statue, stone man dead and cold.
May I touch your inscription?  Dare I be so bold?
The thoughts off your glory, the tales of your woe
I am sacred for you, but than, you'll never know.

They both Sing:
Oh terrible statue that shows what we lack,
Your ideals are damning, sir, please don't come back.



All I have is sharpie.

All I have is loud green.

All I have is thick lines

That make me skip lines.

All I have is overstatement.

All I show is the obvious.

All I am is my monkey hands.

That makes me laugh : My monkey hands.

My loud thick lined overstatements of the obvious.

My sharp green whit

And your insistence to skip it

With a laugh, saying it’s bullshit.



Dull Whimper

The faintly green sloppy spot of existence

Right between what just happened and what’s about to.

The nausea ‘tween quake and aftershock.  The land of the dull whimper

Where spiders crawl across your brain

And you’re forced to stop flexing it.



We write to Prove



A universal paranoia that we don’t exist. (strokes)

we can tell there’s something missing and we subconsciously suspect that it’s us.







Mold Fingers

Let the words grow on your paper almost like mold fingers feeling up and down blue line horizon curves



Chronos the Destroyer (drawing)



Down the Road

The one I thought I really loved I never felt like this for.  I only wrote 13 eulogies wo what I thought we had..   But this one, boy.  She’s in my blood.  Gives me the shakes.  We don’t even speak the same language, but I crave her like a drug.  I want a beer.  I wanna be near her.  I want a beer.  I want her to glance at me.  And playfully knock into me.  And than…

It’s not even the sex.  It’s the fire the spark the wild eyes and energy.  Flirtation in the dark.  Always after midnite.  Always slightly drunk.

Wandering from infatuation to depression and back to unstable interest slowly growing into lust than settling into obsession.

Let’s see what fuckin happens.  I’ll walk down the road.  Hope there’s a god.  Pray the3re’s a heaven.  And pretend that I’m destined to end where I end.



Dopesick

Don’t make me dopesick babe, don’t make me dopesick.

It ent the same as ‘love’, you do something to me.

It does nothing for me.  It makes me dopesick.

How easily your sweetest lovers replace each other.

Best friends, brothers, stepping on faces to replace your latest reject breakdown case.

I don’t care if you think I’m your greatest.

Just don’t make me dopesick, babe.

You seem done.  Live you’ve moved on.  Not enuf fun? The magic is gone?

I guess you’d better run.  I was hoping you’d stay longer.

Slide into the foetal position like a kitten in a bowl of grease.

Can’t sleep.  Too tired to grit my teeth.  Too freaked out to speak.

An AssaultFall  ‘07



I want to front an assault on your good taste.

I want to take my charcoal grease fingers

And smear them across your good name.

I want to make you feel guilty.  Unsure.

To Question all you hold dear.

I have something for you :  Fear

Bile

Confusion

Denial.

The satisfying sense of knowing

You’re fucked.

You’re fucked.

You’re fucked.

I look up and notice

Across the street

The building that saysSanta Cruz Aids Project

And I picture a get together of naked savages

(civilized as all hell) in a plush apartment

Put together with pillows and grins and

Whispers and skin and that sweet little blonde

With the bosoms who never looks back.

I look up and notice

Across the street

The building that saysSanta Cruz Aids Project

And I picture an arts and crafts party

An orgy where they create things like Aids

And Sin out of their sex.



























Blue Lines for Neatness

What can I say?  The page in front of me is blank.  It stares at me like an empty stomach.  “Create me!”  Some creature calls from deep within my hollow skull.  “Create me!”

I pick up the pen and put the cap on the back.  I sit and stare for a second.  I try really hard to not chew my fingernails.

My mind is blanker than the paper, because it doesn’t have the horizontal blue lines for neatness.  I look down at my hands and decide that the extra fine precise v5 pen looks kind of like a hypodermic needle filled with ink.  Maybe it’s actually gray matter that I sucked out of my very own brain via the nasal passage, and now I am scratching down words with it.

Still somewhere, I can hear the echo…  “create me!”  Maybe it’s coming from outside.  I glace at the door, and decide I don’t really care.  Whateve4r, whoever you are, I am apparently unavailable for comment.

I hear an occasional footstep or scratching, but I know it’s not a druid searching for the chosen one who may or may not be me.  I know it’s not a drop deed gorgeous blonde who will hand me an envelop and than drop dead.  I know it’s not a crazy scientist who spent all of his inheritance money creating a game involving a room with a mattress floor, magnet shoes, and magnets under the mattresses.  So you float around and fall and shit.

There’s nothing out there.

God, I hope there is.

Letterfall

Laffing Liquid Languid Lucid Lucifer purs when I touch his tabby tail, prongs on the tip.  I slip into silly hypnotic word play and trace it onto the walls.  Letters fall onto stacks of tracing paper laid out on the floor.  The door is locked and I dance across the horizontal mural of language and laugh to myself as a ‘J’ drapes across the bridge of my nose, wet and slimey, freshly seeped from the walls and ceiling steeped like tea in my existence.  I’m the prince of this rainforest most verbose.  In the corner under the bed is a spot the letters never drop onto.  I even moved the bed, but the letters slide off like egg yolks in oil.  So I try a new approach.  I grab a handful of letters that have slid into the corners and grind them in a blender into tye dye paste.  I water it down with whiskey, and feed it back into the ceiling using a drip system.  I lay down a canvas, specially made to soak up whiskey mess.  But I digress.









Note to Self

It looks dirty

And smells like death from where you’re sitting.

But that’s only ‘cause you’re wallowing in your own feces.

It’s not as shitty as your darkness hopes.

It’s not as fucked up as your masochism begs for.

You’re not as doomed as your self-loathing prophecies.

So shut the fuck up and pull your head out of your ass.



Lunar Whatnot

I went to the curbside and smoked with the moon.

I wanted to touch it.  Consume it.  Become it.

All I could do was look and be near it.

A couple few thousand what-have-you’s away.

A lens into heaven, the glint of gods eye,

Just a reflection of the pupil of the sky.

Looking down somewhere else now, Australia or France,

And we’re left with reflections to keep us alive.















Tranquilized by Dark Gypsy Eyes

Life, Tomorrow, Adulthood…  It’s coming.   It’s coming…

I have to grab you.  We have to leave.

We’ll escape to a spot where time is not and lie there fore eternity.

Where will I be?  In a year?  Two or three?

Fear and paranoia.  Tomorrow. .  .   It’s going.  It’s going.  .   .    .

Make it stop.  If anyone, you can.

Just look at me – and I’ll look at you

Can your face stop a clock?  I hope it can.

Can your dark gypsy eyes take us off this treadmill?

It’s going…  It’s going…

Full body shivers.  My whole body quivers from your touch.

That’s the spot.

Don’t stop.  Everything else, stop.  But not you.



Oedi-Piss-Off

I killed my father and fucked my mother.
An unnecessary metaphor for the final rite of passage.

Lackluster unblistered barefaced man-boy.

Big words from a small mind.  Small enough to reduce adulthood to a patricidal seduction.

You almost were nothing but a stain on dad’s sheets.

Now you spill the same life juice in crumpled up Kleenex.

But you’re not your father his equal or close.

You just learned a new trick that you practice at night.

I wonder if all that you spill becomes ghosts

That haunt you like crickets and play with your mind.

Scratchy Voiced Anti Christ

Scratchy Voiced

Dirty old Grunge bucket

Wailing your sorrows into the dark misty night air

That hangs on your bare neck and cheeks

Like the hand of death caressing you

Like a veloceraptor t oying with its prey.

Will they come from Miles and Miles around?

Will they Wail and Weep?  Leave their somber seats?

Or will it be a small service, a modest inch and a half

Summing me up obituary stylie…

Maybe I’ll be abroad…A doomed soulon a doomed ship …

Lost at sea Unmissed…

Would that make me more immortal?  Each though of me would be,

“Remember Mikey?  Where is he?”

“Last I heard he was headed south, outa Colorado.  Goin home I do believe.”

And they’ll shake their heads and mumble.

“Good for him.”  (whatever that means)

Or am I the anti chrust?  Doomed to lead the world to hell?

Destined and led by powers beyond me.

What would you say if he came to you?

“You’re chosen my son.  You have a father.  His words you shall follow.”

And he came as an angel dressed radiant and white.

Prophet of God, or so he said that night.



Wash Away

You know what washes away?

The Make upThe tears

The yellingThe creased brow

The sunken eyesThe quivering lip

The limp cheek fleshThe torn stained dress.

These are washed and burned away

And you’re left alone, a naked faerie.A series of scars

Permanized in your skin

Interconnected,

Sketching what actually is.

Like the shroud of Turin

The power held within

Burns its image immortally

Into the sweet soft canvas of your skin.

And you hide itAnd deny it.

Because they don’t approve

But I don’t want your reasonable accepted façade.

I want the erratic spastic true you.

My scars have started to sketch your face.

And I fear the concealer you wield like whitewash,

As you promise me solo nights of peace,

Or at least pacification.





On Feet

Lately I’ve been looking up from my feet,

And realizing I’m already in the middle of the street.

As if my feet had proclaimed it was safe ride of way

And stepped off the sidewalk not waiting for word from the brain.

Maybe next time I’ll notice and watch from the skull cavern,

Not get involved, I’ll just see if my feet insist on taking me Recklessly into the street.



Rest Weary, Sweet Poison Sucker

Dark Sunglasses in classI mean to glance at my leisure

Right now my leisure sits directly across.  Legs uncrossed, hand flopping relaxed into crotch

Like an old sailor with crabs.

Eyes peer out from caves of makeup.  Lackadaisical black galoshes.

She brushes the nub of her pen across her chin
And suddenly once again I spin through my desert within.

Rumble flow fall across internal landscapes with skies of dripping streaking paint.

A faint rumble from the foreground, perhaps indigestion.

The liver sun crawls behind the horizon.

Rest weary, sweet poison sucker…



Sharp Edges

It’s a terrible grinding scraping noise

It reeks of burning trash.

It’s the sharp edge of metal and stinging nettle.

There’s dirt on my teeth and dust on my tongue.

And I’m staring at the girl I love.

Redial.      (fragments)

Redial again.  Wha…  … redial for the sixth time, constantly chiefing a cigarette the whole ….

… there’s a certain point when the phone has been ringing for … …like the ringing coming out if the receiver is some … …ahead blankly, not a thought crossing your mind.  He hasn’t…  … Sorry sap.

I get to picturing… … torn up, so she must have been one of those horribly gorgeous… … his range for the moment.  Appreciated something too much.  And …  … never able to marry into his social strata without undue drama.  He’s pacing now…   …walks into the kitchen.  His eyes are creeping me out.  Like drilling holes through bone.  Ugh~  look at his fingers.  He’s bleeding from his fingernails.  This chick has officially gotten under his skin.  To the point where he’s staining bloody fingerprints on everything he touches.  And he doesn’t seem aware of it.  Except when he hits redial.  You see him flinch from the bared soft pink skin where the nail used to be now being used as a prodding utensil.  His knuckles stopped popping an hour ago, and the smoking doesn’t seem to be helping, and he’s grinding his teeth, but like sideways, so it makes more of a squeak than a grinding noise.  Like something’s about to pop loose.

You can tell he has a stiff neck, and watching him force it around like bruce lee, and the nasty popping sounds.  Oh lordy.  He’s goin for another cigarette.  He looks tired.  His face has slumped, a collapsing circus tent.  The crazies looks have dissipated from his face.  The circus freak emotion movements of rattling bones and picking at stickers seem to have subsided.  He looks down at his hands, and he seems to be accepting them as his own.  As if now, upon being beaten, he can stop acting like a jackass.  His eyes wander up and rest on the phone.  He picks it up, like it’s a small delicate tranquilized creature, and with a sudden burst of movement, he hurls the phone through the window.

The sound of glass breaking has this resounding finality to it.

Very much unlike a ringing phone.

Things To Say To Yourself When Your Mind Is Blown

Stay Slow, Stay Deliberate.

Stay Busy, Stay Well.



I Understand

I understand why

I don’t understand the frantic city scene.

Through all their fun and things to be done, They left out the in between.

Poo Zen



Fifteen beers resting on my morning after muddy mind

Racous Cconstruction sounds surround

My blue womb.  A moment away.

With the ticka-tacka rattle smash of a jack hammer breaking concrete across the street.

My porta potty zen moment.
Relax and release.

Take the time you severely need

To scrape together the gumption

To wipe the shit away and continue on with the day.



Who gave you poetic license to cap on bitches?

So I’m walking through a parking lot and I see a Dandylion.
Ah, how sweet and nice.  Blooming in such a bland asphault setting.

I pick it.

Across the parking lot, I walk into a florist shop.

Once inside, I stop, and say

“What the fuck am I doing with this dandylion?”



Right Now

But I can’t think about that

Right Now because

Right Now I’m walking down

This Beautiful road at

This Beautiful time of nite to see

This Beautiful girl.  When I get there I will sing her a song about how fucked up today is.

Doll Face

GI Joe hands linked in playtime connection.

Plastic doesn’t bleed.  Artificial things don’t go bad.

I’ll be your action figure, if you’ll be my doll face.

Gush Again

When I touch you I gush open

Like a nauseating laceration. A gash.

And my insides go everywhere.

I hate my stomach, and my eyes.

I hate my hands and my face.

  I feel crazy again

All fucked up within

Again.

On Heaven



There shall be no sickness or sorrow.  No pain or destruction.

Will the rivers still eat away at their beds creating massive networks of canyons and patterns?  Will the rain still pelt our perfected faces and drip down the nape of our eternal necks?

Will the leaves still cringe and curl with their final autumnal death rattle rust colors?  Will a roses petals still fall to the ground, blood red and dry as dust?

Will the wind still whip through the wilderness screaming a banshee song, chilling body and soul as one?

Will the glaring sun still bake and singe our pale skin?

Will conquering a mountain be as pleasing and filled with meaning with burning chest and blurry eyes?

Will a sunset still be glorified and enhanced by the dust fog and smog?







Remember to Worry

I used to forget what I was worrying about, and it would make me frantic, thinking that I would never again remember my problem, and thus never solve it.  Now when I can’t remember why I’m worried, my bottom lip relaxes, and my brow unfurrows.  My lip is finally getting better.  This morning I looked in the mirror and my split lip looked horrible.  It worried me.  When I get worried I chew my lip.  I walked out of the bathroom chewing my lip, wondering why it wouldn’t heal.





On Strange Wakings

My face is marked by couch cushions and fancy intuitions.

My hands trace the birthmark of our unholy generation.



Sometimes Insomnia

Sometimes I have to

Stop touching you

Until my head clears.



On Intimacy

Someone once said that when people open up to him,

He feels like an emotional dump station.

God, I hope I didn’t say that.



Dead End Logic

Is there any lasting truth?

No, all truth is only momentary.

Well, if that’s true than it will always be true, and therefore it’s false.



34.The Gate

I saw a gate today.  It led through a  stone archway into

I know not what.

I pictured Romeo loaning Robin Hood a key, or getting let in by the Some ancient maid.

It made me happy to think that I was starting to notice the beautiful things.

I glanced down a the sidewalk and broken, before the gate, lay the all consuming phallus,

A used syringe.
Beautiful..things…                                     Damn.

I’m in the flats, aren’t I? damn.



Eat Me

There’s always the right song on the radio and something more I hadn’t quite seen…

Relaxing creature, please eat me.

Slowly, quietly eyes open,

free me.



Her Smell Still Lingers

Her profile? Perfect.  Sweet and easily looked at.  But her arms were hairy and she smelled like garlic.

Gently proportioned body, subtle soft slopes.   But her arms were hairy and she smelled like garlic.

small delicate feminine hands sadly not held by mine. (her arms were hairy and she smelled like garlic)

She stood by me on the bus, stole sly glances…       But her arms were hairy and she smelled like garlic.

She (intentionally?) bumped into me on corners.    But her arms were hairy and she smelled like garlic.

Some things just aren’t meant to be.







Socks

Good things and bad things about being grown up.

Good :  I can wear socks outside now without shoes.

Bad :  All by socks are filthy stained and torn.



It

Should I call someone or should I leave it at that?

Play guitar and laugh and dance and let it all just slide away and see the soft wind bleed into your poetry and it will be whatever seems to keep it freezing quietly.  It doesn’t look good for me.



Lackluster Unblistered Barefaced Manboy

Your own personal parade.

Just you and your

Sexy green skirt.  And your

goddamn bangs.  Follwed by your entourage of stares.

Their guilty eyes drag behind you like fish in a net.

And I, the innocent dolphin.

I put in a request to the gods of love.  I want a savage little pocket sized punk rock chick.
A little social unrest never hurt anyone.  After all, I am a non practicing Rockstar.

I don’t perform yet.  Because I have nothing to say.

Digression

They told me that depression is aggression turned inward due to low self esteems.

This sounded plausible, so I bit.  I decided to work on my confidence levels.
I vocalized my aggression by yelling at friends, spitting and swearing, and peeing in public.

Finally I have my decent self esteem and I’m aggressive and rude
But I’m still depressed.

Dear Ann, should I kill myself?

An uninvited enemy friend

I have a pet splinter.  He lives in my finger.
He came into me and my life last year.

At first he was an open wound, raw fresh and unnecessary.

I tried to ostracize him from my life with knife and tweezers.

But he was so deep inside of me, I feared the cutting might kill my finger with him.

So I tolerated his presence and formulated a callous
Now after nearly a year, I’d feel confused if he wasn’t there.

Odd, the reassuring permanence of an uninvited guest.

American Haiku #4

Puddle of dog poo, printed with shoe,

At least my shoes are clean.

Prayer

No, no more.  I no longer love my darkness.

My one wide eye, gleaming teasing tortured paranoia.

I made something for you.

Carved from the brain of a lonely deserted soldier.

Basted and smoothed with rare wine dyed with the red eyes of crying demons.

I’m leaving my voices and locking my dark rooms.
Dust and forgottens replace my lumpy face.  Jumping never sounded right

Until the other night, frantic sad but passive slathered in my own evil dreams.

I could scream and cry, find a way to die gracefully,

IOr I could wait and see.  So I pray now.  It makes the voices go away.

It creates a torniquit ‘tween mea nd my secret freak out sessions.

They have lessened., no longer legions of satanic soldier voices.

Just mine repeating something sweet.  Soft and agreeable.



These thoughts

My mind is mine.  It’s a fuck of a toy.

Magical and pitiful.  Inquisitive and geotal.  Paralyzied and hyperactive.

My forehead lines are crawling along  skin ditches dug by morbid songs.

Like your face in the snow.  A nose dive is all.  Like a smack from a brick with your lips.

And I fall into nowhere.  The dark unlit room that comes along.

Not the womb, no that’s the life song.

This is the secret demon that rapes me and tightens my jaw screw like ecstasy.

It does this a lot.  My brain.  You know.

Wanders into the ssky, touches snow, and right when it’s right, when I like it at night,

It careens into caverns with vulture beak logic.

The dead and the edible.  Vulture beak, speak to me.  Food likked by you is too good.

You prefer leftovers basted in mud.  You prefer bug eyed   nail biting.   Twitches.

The lost the forgotten the meaningless workds.  The things that rattle out

The dark secrets told by birds.  The logic tha might make it into the novel.

The logic that hates me.  That creates my fantasy.  The logic is what doesn’t stop.

The engine running backwards, slowing potential.

The inability to be me.   To bew.   To see what’s sitting next to me.

With the sweetest grin you’ll ever see.  Why can’t I look up from my mudstained shoes,

Condemn my dark logic, abolish my blues…

Why can’t I look at you and grin anymore?  Why does everything taste of sin more and more?

It’s the face behind mine,

I let it slide in.  My angry sad magic.  Potential for tragic.

This is my chance to let it fall away.  Face encrusted with self obsessed sadness mud.

Into the snow I go.  Wash it away, let my real face show.

Shrinking my forehead lines, changing my patterns.

Encouraging laughter under Chinese lanterns.

I’m using my pen in a well lit room to purge out my demons and teeth gritting thoughts.

These thoughts are not for you.

What

Thou shalt not write lines that betray thy mind.

Avoid telling lies to the creatures unkind.

When the water is still we kick up the mud.

Before the fuze was finished we deemed it a dud.

I’ve never exploded.  I’ve never been dead.

I still feel wobbly leaving my head.

My breath is white but my color is red.

I’m guilded and silvered but inside I’m led.

Do you know what I am now?  Can you guess my name?
I made all your greatest creators insane.



Hey chump, you stink of stamp ink.  Been out clubbin?  It’s rubbin off

on the inside of your sleeve.  Keep it up, chump, see what you can be.

Keep it up, but don’t come runnin to me.

Good luck chump, keep clear of the HIV.  Don’t trust love chump, or you’ll end up like me.

Stay buzzed chump, keep your sanity.  Give up Chump, that’s the only way to be free.



Scatalogical Musings

Self righteous monkeys fling pretentious poo

Their views may be true but the words they choose

Are defecation : rude cynical remarks.

A child laughs because farts are a funny noise.

A grown up laughs because he just dropped a big steamer of degrading defecation on someone’s ego.

I’d rather giggle at funny sounds

Than find my solace in bringing others down.
Build your hierarchy.  Keep others in place.

So that you can wake up each morning and tolerate your face.

E

So now no one listens.  So the fuck what?  Just the woodchips and bpuddles and breeze, and I’m still just gritting my teeth in demonic ecstasy.  No song comes, along with no surprise and my flexing fist and sorrowful eyes.  And a breeze I finally feel.  And words I’ll never share.  A crick in my neck and a lackadaisical tone for my hair.  Does god give rain on special occasions?  My liason with drug drink melodrama not quite a cold one….

I’m onto a rattle, most likely an old one.  Soft steps recede from m e.  Nothing they need from me.  Find the faults and all htat is wrong with me.  Eye contact kills.  Disables and malfunctions.  And the punk says eye contact is just a buzz.  Demonizing anything from a buzz…  and I’m done ‘cause I refuse to cry.

Fuzz-Mumble-Juggle

Just another morning drunk story.  Just another nameless bruise.  A series of grins I’ll never remember giving.  Just another puddle of faces mixed in with vodka and monster.  Just another bunch of places I refused to stop

Sunrise lite lands on my leg bruise.  Fight the urge to be crude.  Stay competent.  Palletable.  Fuzz Mumble Juggle my eyes like diamonds in a minefield.

It’s in my knees, like always.  I know the buzzwords, punchlines, and timing.  Instead of rewinding we reenact.

I asked a rockstar

My art and my women and my whatever else weren’t helping

So I asked a rockstar how to be happy.  He tol me to be a singer and teach your sweetie bass guitar.

I tried it out, and she ran awawy with the drummer.  So I asked a drummer how to be happy.
He tol me to learn drums and abandon all hope.  I tried that and realized I was attaining my goals by abandoning them.

I asked a bass player how to be happy.  He tol me learn the bass and improvise something clever

To end your stupid poem with…

Dad’s Hat

Maybe it seems silly that my clothes

Maintain the approach to fashion used

Tween the time you’re two and twelve.

It does seem silly, but really,

It’s a socio-economic statement about how everyone else is really

Just putting on their parents clothes.

All that’s left

The girl carrying the banana peel could very well may not be depressed.

It doesn’t matter that she’s smiling.  Her weak mouth muscles pushing the corners upward

aren’t enough to counteract the drooping banana skin.  It overwhelms her demeanor,

and makes her own smile nothing more than an attempt to mask the banana sadness.

Why?

Why am I

Surrounded by

You now?



Curiouser and curiouser and louder and longer and funnier and faster…



The Poet and The Priest

Once upon a time there was a poet, a nihilist, a thief, a goober, an anarchist, a womanizer, a drug addict, and a priest.  He thought of himself as a happy man, because the only thing in all the land he lacked and could not seem to have was a name.







That Just Won’t Do.

Just follow the haunting blues melody..

Lazy

Wandering down to the river

To listen as it tells you about its dream.

My teethtoo lazy

Too tired to grit

Any further.

My fingerschewed open

And raw.

The climax of the falling action

(the fidgety after-echo of it all)

My thumb is raw.  I ripped it open with my teeth last night.  My teeth.  With the clicking and the clenching of electricity streaming through me.  It played me.  It used me up.  Dragged me to that strange abyss.  And already I miss it.  The unsteady shiver of sight, The night was mine for a moment.  My toes in the mud of rugby, phillip Prometheus morris clenched in my electric teeth.  A frantic five minute scramble, the ball always just not quite there.  Than a moment.  “Oh my, I might be dying.”    Walk off the field.  Breathe.  Don’t choke.  Sweat and glisten.  Feel the wetness and listen to the chorus of haoarse rugby voices and become one of the night.

-sigh

‘release’

As hissing steam valve

Engine idle.  Standing by.

Finally timeto sit.

Am I, at long last, alone?

It’s all repetition.  Repeat it until it drops into place.  Repeat it  Until the patterns sketch out a face.

Repeat it to yourself until it’s truly yours.  Until the words stop and salute as you speak them



De-la-vision

Delusional.It’s lonely up here.

I guess I gave out the wrong address.

Maybe I’m not writing from my gut yet.  Maybe this is as good as it’s gonna get.

Maybe I should check for my competence…  lost midsentence.

Gone back to from whence it came from once. And all that noise.

Meaning dripping towards the floor off the page.  Molasses marmalade

And the words disappear.  The letter shapes are still here.

The leg of a J, the arm of an R.  But they’re skinny wimpy twig things

That now mean nothing to me.

Maybe tomorrow.

Maybe.

Muskrat Acid

Frantic? Edgy?

Fuzzy? FUkt.

Sleep deprived malnourished.  I just dropped back into it.

Gut bomb blackout jacket six pack pbr in ma backpack

Feel the muskrat acid flashback.

The immortals make messes.

Gut bomb thunder mud fart rips through inner landscapes like hungry jackal.

Rumble Spit

Not much in common with the early riser crowd.  Except coffee.  And possibly stress and cigarettes.

The sunrise on my bruise seems to burn for some reason.

It’s been a minute since I was gittin swamped to the gills as my way of livin.

I’ll sleep it off after class.  Yeah.  On a patch of extra soft grass.

This aint my final binge.  If it were it would last a year.

Don’t play for keeps on other peoples collateral.

Don’t replace your pick up lines with catcalls.

Rumble spit drooling out words and catchphrases…

Lobo

I keep trying to prove something.  With desperate flailing attempts

To seem at ease.  Quelled by the thought that I simply need to be.



Like Lenny, I like soft things.
pet them and play with their grins.
Than I wonder what’s wrong.  Why did something change?  Why does it seem deranged?



And I reach inside my face and pull out yours.  I blame you for the torture.

For these creatures in my brain…

Passive lobotomize self control demon eyes try and hold the burning sphere.  Self aware tortured fears and farcical feelings that shatter thought patterns.
Manifest.  The lollipop tree in your chest.  Here we stand left with memories.

Thoughts of who I felt you were and blames and fists and shameful night games of running through and away past statues I mocked and ruined all those years ago.

This is not where I once was or who we once were.  I’ve been hurtled away left crazy.  Deranged all I have is this convoluted fuck of a brain.  Unready leery of self determined to help but causing hell.  Thinking and thought and letting in run on but not off.  It’s over.  The levels are high.  The water spills my emotions die and crawl out of the sewer.  Think back.  It was you.  We were there, with glimmering eyes.  The sun smiled above and I rubbed my temples with soft crazy dust of drugs…

Mandala Tune

Language is complete abstraction of the physical.

Music is innately physical, and is man’s attempt to mimic and may homage to the sound aspects of the physical.  Math is a language.  Weak attempt to capture and explain.

\Music and nonsense is man relaxing and taking part in his indescribable existence.

Legal Language (Never allow yourself not to be…)

In an attempt to elucitdate and clarify every possible loop hole, legal language ties itself up and starts poking itself with a baton.



Pluck

The scurrying skirts shuffle on past

And pluck out my eyes as a game.

I used to wait for it to make sense

But once it makes sense, I’ll know I’m insane.

Like I’m caught in the wake of a boat this is passing.

I feel my gaze getting caught in the tow.

Curving round corners and creeping along.

The scent of her, thought of her, crawled in my ear

It cooed and it toyed and it fucked with the gears.

I bring her home, give her wine and a rose, and than, I remember.

That’s not where I am.

I’m sitting alone in a parking lot

Stoned.

People in the Room

A welcome invasion that sends the mind roaches scurrying back to the dark corners of your mind.

The thought that all these people and all their movements are apart from you but a part of your mood.

The passing conversations that loiters and rhymes along no path in particular.

Sometimes it seems like these things I’ve set up around me

Are props to ward off the darkness

To make it easier moving through this nothing alone.

We all thrive on the same generational belly fire

We exist in a realm of similar visions.

To Filter.  To Respond.  To Clarify.  To Expound.



Walk-Write

My intention is to resist this sense of intense alienation,

Maybe one day to end this incessant inner transience, and

Transcend this endless run on sentence.

You may have problems, but none of the rest of us don’t.\



Ulysses

When one reads these strange pages of one long gone,

One feels that one is at one with the one who once wandered on…



Thought Stop

Dear Worried Person Whispering In My Brain Cabinet

So I forget where I am sometimes.  So what?

I get super spaced out.  So what.  It’s not something to “Worry” about.

Being a worried person is something to worry about.  And I’m not a worried person.



There’s a rock in my head there’s a rock in my head there’s a rock in my head there’s a rock



Zig Zag

The Zig Zag patterns of my mind across your sky.

My secret me has set out on a voyage across your back, along your spine

Through your skull door into your mind, curled up kitten style behind your eyes.









On the Decent

The decent people, why do I despise them so?

Whenever I think about how lucky I am, I always feel like I owe somebody,

Or like, a massive bill is gonna show up soon.

Choppy simplistic utopias shatter like glass ashtrays.

I refuse to say “struggling through the haze”

Or claim that I have a ceramic head today.

No longer shall I loiter in delinquent imagery.

Nay, I shall find the source of my sanity!

(I write so much better when I’m drunk)



Gypsy Fingers

Cold reader, Gypsy Fingers, Tell me what you see.

Through my palms show the visions of me.

You see yourself when you were in search of something else.

You see the soft hands of a student, not used to labor, weakened by thought.

You talk of what I find in women.  Shapes you see in my hand.

The back of the neck, the buttocks, the nose.

Veiled vagueries leave me reaching.
Your cold reading description =provokes the falling inward.

Nothing More



I done burned my fuckin chicken fingers on that bitch’s stove.  I shoulda worn a glove.

Fantastic Phantasm apparition.  Dirty unquenchable bitch.  Riddled with sarcasms

Faux cuteness held out like cheese in a mouse trap.
Wield it was a weapon.  Defy the world.  And convention and consistency.

Conniving doesn’t seem to be your thing.

No, you’re much more subtle and overwhelming.

Finding the loophole, the way back in.

Last time was something.Something.

But nothing more.

We Cannot Use

We cannot use writing

To justifyour dysfunctional patterns.

Rather we must use writing         to      Clarify,

Elucidate,

Approach,

AndAbolish our incapacity to step outside the self

And recognize the true fool.



I know very little of him.





I know that he's not to be trusted,

well, according to someone I know.



I know that he might have a child somewhere,

But where and from whom, I don't know.



I know that he smiles only at certain times.

I know that he tells the occasional lie.

I know that he's funny when he wants to be.

I know that he's not what he thought he would be.


I know very little of him. Oh, how little I know.
Every Night in Every City, All Across America.
Or Exercises in Post Modern Prose.

Huge Throbbing punks answer collect calls from receptionists on lunch break
This is a time for bitch lore told by ghost story sellouts,
Reading off a phone pole six inches deep with concert flyers.
Mourning hymns greet sunrise processions; Death hungover at a funeral party,
Always chasing skirts.
And Death is a dirty flirt, always first on the scene.
I sit on the shoulders of giants and gentleman,
Playing chicken with lightning bugs.

“Woah ho ho” is a new face;
Sound resounding in echo shots off the canyons of mind space.
My flaxen haired princess dancing with seven veils in silhouettes on a cave wall.

Finding only puppets and pretenders we soldier on,
Searching and lurching;
Motion sick on an oil slick of
                                                                             loose
                                                                                                                  change.
Each page a veritable lexicon in process,
And a sign on the door reads
“Out to Lunch.”

Drift drifting swift dynamis,
A shift winded long;
A love affair with a fair haired harlot,
Scarlet lady with seductress eyes;
Smiles.
I’m skipping beats and thirty-three and a third in the passenger side of the carpool lane.
My driver reeks of whiskey and Camel Lights.
He’s yelling over the stereo;
A Siren’s song in futility.
The things we do for Tequila Tuesday.
Always along for the ride, we take back streets.
Fast food wrappers and cigarette remains litter what once was a floor.
The back seat passenger is an assortment of possibly laundered wardrobery.
We speed down,
whipping around corners in search of coroners
And Rest in peace.
Transitions don’t come easy.

I’m the beat down of a morning erection,
While the red-haired green-eyed bride of Satan
Sings old songs with burnouts and punks in the back room of a coffee house.
On a sidewalk couples stride hand in hand along side third wheel friendships;
Snide jokes written margin-side to amuse the perceptive.
“Jesus!”
 “Someone’s going to have hell to pay.”
We are blasphemers in debtor’s prison;
This purgatory of princes.
I make no promises of sense-making in these brief moments of sobriety.

Third minds drift by the wayside,
Seeds sown sans care by dirt merchants and mediocre scam artists;
Self absorbed attention whores,
Drunk off years of neglect.
The first one’s always free.
Soldier on little lover, someday your heart will race
A tour d’ force,
Cyclically.
You’re a adorable in your own way;
Faint smiles and quiet words whispered in tandem.
Persons and people watchers, content to observe,
Never missing moments.

We stand adrift in the shallows,
Afraid of depth and the dangers lurking therein.
Neon signs bark in color code at strangers and street preachers,
Sipping away at pink slips while cloudy headed muses shout from rooftops
Via the mouths of suicide youths.
Self destructive simpletons drinking themselves to a glorious oblivion.

In between snores on the sidewalk,
An androgynous bi-polarity spins like a yin-yang.
Constants flux, a redux of yesterday in detail.
Red dressed vixens beat in time with a funeral brigade,
A parade of peacocks in full bloom spread plumage fanned out like Tarot cards;
The Fool in Kether.

Summer storms wash away muggy memories of nights previous.
Thunder rattles the windows of old Colonials
Sending shivers of ancient nightmares to the sleeping minds of infants.

Well rounded table nights and five card studs makes bets against the odds.
Crack a bottle with a Bic;
Suds explosion followed by table mopping behind fluorescent beer signs,
Previously hung where steins were lifted.

Cannon fodder fiddlers sing ballads behind empty hats,
Parole officer shake downs spread fear along paranoid paths,
Catching in well made traps the down trodden.
No body wins the spite game.
Back and forth motivated members make a mockery of all things sacred.
Seductress in a red dress stands under a street light,
A solitary soldier of vice,
The Spice of Life.

These tales told ad nauseum, this mausoleum of scripts written cryptically,
Full of resounding non-chalance.
We sit on doorsteps steeped in funnel cake memories
Watching carpet baggers peddle wares from house to house.

In the face of absolute terror
Pan pipes smoke via ventilation shafts
Billowing on pillows we sit, my friends and I
Drunkenly inhaling.
Sweating and restlessness set in.
You see, the reason we aren’t so close is that
I simply can’t risk
                                                          Fall
                                                                 i

with you.

Saunter and sway, slow motion collapse.
Head held by hands not his
Rousing eye slits crack to light blinding flashes
Reflexive defensive mechanisms shut it out again.
Fever fever, inferno on a forehead.
One extra to keep an eye on heaven.

Kittens snore sofa-side
Down syndrome eyes and autistic grins
showing the first signs of sadism.
“Hell no! You’re a crazy bitch!”
Snap shots hung with magnets pull you in
Same sages burn brushes still fresh and saffron red.
Bread bakers rise early at optimal temperatures
Engaging in life long yeast adventures.

Indulge your petty preoccupations,
Predict fear and project vanity.
The soul pours in draughts during droughts
Doubting the return of a messiah in bell-bottoms.
Clean shaven sons of sacrifice pledge their lives on TV screens.
This is a test of the will on it’s own terms.

She’s in the restroom powdering her nose
In a stall with the powder in her lap and a veil over her face.
She cuts up lines.

Heaven words bound,
Prometheus is fucking Theophobia in an hourglass.
This mythical masturbation;
Beowulf in shepherd’s clothing
And a little child shall deceive them.
We toss coins in trinities pretending they are sticks
“And stones will break my adulterous bones,” said She.
Try fatalism on for size.
Not so much an outfit as it is a mob.
This mentality speeds down a mounting pass; words
Accessible over changed-linked fences.
Expecting spenders we settle for fifteen percent.
It’s enough to get us in the door,
But Knocking is for guests.
We turn the knob by remembering it isn’t there
And so we turn the hourglass over, reversing the cowgirl.
Isis in a ten gallon hat with a sheriff’s badge.

She’ll have a Madonna on the rocks and I’ll have the same.
But we don’t smoke rocks, we chase dragons.
St. George in his birthday suit ferries us across the Styx,
Humming Credence Clearwater Revival.

Summer storms in like a soliloquy on an empty stage,
Hailing in pebbles stinging sideways due to wind change.
This light shows sizable these seated statues;
Bobbing plastic birds to drink.
Houses of non-merriment pent up to the ceiling with socialites.

Pitcher chase after DUI pursuits;
We rest up.
Our knives are stained from sitting fire side
In between rings of glowing coils.
We billow in beer bottle hooters,
Sucking up our guts as girls process in succession
Ascending to throne rooms with hair held back,
This reckless infatuation crashes in a furious flurry of sparks.

Ebb and flow like a hustler,
Beckon to shadows cloaked in whispers.
I’ve met some shady characters.
Persist and perspire.
He holds his knees chin-ward, wallowing in self pity.
It’s the little victories, really.
He told me good things happen to good people,
And I wanted to punch his ignorant mouth.
They made a mockery of his affections
And sport of his sincerity.

He’s a Polaroid head case;
Flashing in moments of clarity
These wishes of divine singularity,
Singing all the while,
“We shall overcome.”
This masochistic streak leaves me with naught but an empty wallet and desperation.
Oh, that there were streams of stars,
All scuttlebutt and no noise.

We pick up again at the drop of a needle,
Vastly imbalanced now.
Chemical arrest is one way to put it.
Curiouser and curiouser,
Down into the habit hole.

A photo finish of sorts; This business.
We digress in unison riding passenger side on the omnibus.
I said it all in capitol letters;
That Stupid Son Of A Bitch.
In the hour of transition into a butterfly,
I cocoon.
Amore’d up we lunge into this plunging motion.
A morose reminder tacked in sticky notes.
Quiver erroneously; shivers in this chill factor
Send breaks to snake charmers.

Focus! Focus on these,
This ink stained hocus pocus.
Write out of love, out of spite.
Spit fire and breath venom vehemently.
Cowardly staring at conflict we resolve to opting out entirely.

Intimate plans best laid to rest
These times that test the unbroken men,
In droves they wait in line for words to say;
Tongue-tied orators tease in paragraphs
Using bullshit prose like matadors in heat.

Crumbly bums make their way to Greyhound launch pads;
Life couches sans a fairy godmother.
We dance at two steps up flights of stairs
Amidst stares and glaring streetlight serenades.
My baby lobbing grenades into the lobby of the State Street Motel.
Vacant stares, previously vacant stairs now occupied by chain smoking adolescents.
You and me baby, until the sun burns out.

Conversation play out over loud speakers on sets designed by opium addicts.
God bless the word junkies
Getting kicks from a thesaurus.
Cold fingers etching rigor mortis post-mortem pen vomit
Cock teases strip paint off the ceiling
Rocking on to aerobics videos,
Eating hotdogs out of buns of steel.

Catch that dawn light in a cab ride,
Hold it in the palm of your hand on the doorstep of the crash space you call home.
Use it to light that last cigarette.
Sit and decipher these hand written sloppy love letters to the damned.
Gazing towards heaven,
But it�s only space.
Empty infinite boarding school for Stars.
And I linger on
Lying on the floors of saints
Wallowing in their unclean carpets
Wishing on a painted moon
I wake only to find
The fading memory of a dream
That left me blue balled.


The Scientific Method.

It�s thirty-six inches from me to you.
Measuring tape seldom lies. Retracts with a snap
Recoils and whirs.
Extending again to find the extent
And no, not the former habitat of past camping trips.
Stretch up and out to cards long ago shuffled
And it�s sixty-three inches from you to aces.
Misplaced poker hands stuck with invisible adhesives
Making a map of potential pot winners
Granting solace to chip holders.
We measure again a means to an end.
It�s fifty-four inches before you go.
The distance to broken doorways with still working locks
Soon passing through your feet clad in shoes
Or your sole bared in flip-flops.


On Sexual Frustration.

Big fan of summertime
Summertime with short skirts
And low riding hip huggers
Halter top heroin
Just let me inject interjections
And rejection junkies on a sidewalk fix.

Cleavage peeks from the bosoms and blossoms
Tank top titters and sniggering giggles
Give rise, give rise
And Christ alive a little release.

Meticulously catalog the hunched over
Un-pantied ass cracks
Pleasant distractions compliments of Levi Strauss
I can�t protest the way women dress
In this season of heat.
You can only admire, be pleased by the tease
Sultry skin scenes played out between shoulder blades.

Leggy lovers spreading rumors amongst other things.
Only imagine the treasures hidden under very impractical shorts.
Eye catching ankle tattoos give me kicks
And people watching is always cheaper than strip clubs.
Until you get home, dead bolted door behind you
And engage in purely utilitarian masturbation rituals
Sowing your seeds in the crumpled tissues of loneliness
Just to empty out excess body fluids.
Hazy Lazy beginnings
Foggy after tastes and Facial scars.
As Far as gentle is concerned, we don’t have time for that.
This is greedy, take what you can now
Famine to feasting
And punched in the neck by a pair of blue eyes with teeth.
Blue eyes and blue balls, blue skies
And just blow me.
Blown away and breathless
But this is someone else’s couch.
Casual cameos compromise integrity
Exercise caution but retain curious urges
Ruthless, relentless
And Less rest then I needed.
Sleep deprived self censor breakdowns
Leading to finger rhythm drum beats
Heartbeats and hard heavy breathing
But this is someone else’s couch.
And I didn’t even get her number.

But to sum it up in a limerick.
On my neck is a ghastly abrasion
The skin print of last night’s liaison
Why must you tease me?
When you know what your needs be
Leaving graffiti to mark the occasion.
I was going to write a poem about loneliness and sobriety.
I was starring at the wall and couldn’t sleep
Again.
When I turned out the light and went to bed
In place of you I read a story
About an emaciated daredevil.
He died trying to become famous.
He pulled three and a half stunts
And then he died.
In my bed I’m on a motorcycle
Flying over a line of semi-trucks
Your name is Peterbuilt
And you’re the last truck in the line.


Why yes, I have tried flossing.

At five thirty in the morning
The only sound is wheezy breathing coming through the wall
One of the teeth on my right side feels funny
But it’s not hilarious.
My tooth is terrible at standup comedy
All his jokes are racist and vaudevillian
After the show he goes to his dressing room
Lights a cheap cigar, drinks bad brandy
And misses his uncle
The one that taught him how to laugh.


With a pretty bow on top.

I’ve been trying quite hard not to write about you.
Like when you were a child and you had a gift that was
So special
That secretly you hid the treasure
Only bringing to light when alone for fear that someone would
Steal, mock, judge, destroy, crush
And the gift would disappear
If you told even god in your prayers
But secret gifts have a tendency to wander off
And right now
I am all the wrapping paper in the world
On the day after Christmas





The time is six in the morning
I am sober, therefore I wake
And write shitty poems
That are not about you
Or the lack thereof.
I see your face when I close my eyes
So I turn over
To cook under your gaze
Equally on all sides
And wish for the thousandth time
That I bought some whiskey
So that when I close my eyes
I see nothing
And I don’t have to
Write shitty poems
That are not about you
At six in the morning.



Pokerface.
I read a story once
Maybe in the paper
About a man that was stranded in the dessert
He had a small flask of water which he sipped sparingly
He wandered in as straight of a line as he could
Sipping only when necessary.
He found old water bottles, dry and plastic
Empty and drained.
He walked into a fence eventually
That contained a yard for someone’s house
The fence surrounded a swimming pool
He was found floating face down
And grinning in a way
Completely unsuitable for playing poker.



Advertisements cease making sense.
No all, but some.  Sombunal.
Some people read on the train.
But not all.
Some read books with fine titles and flashy tits.
Her face wasn’t so bad really.
She made up for it by allowing her breasts to buoy out of her blouse.
Calling lost sailors to shore,
Distracting them from the cliffs of her face.


Unrequited love
Is going to be the death of me
If the cancer doesn’t catch up.



Oakland passes underneath me
Like sweeping the kitchen floor
And watching the crumbs seek refuge
Under the oven.


The coliseum stands like a concrete bunker
Awaiting war time
When grown men fight over an inflated ball.



You know how I know we’re perfect apart?
Because when I went home with you
There was an inch of bourbon
In the bottle by your bed.
And when I got home
There was an inch of bourbon
In the bottle next to mine.



Hello Nine A.M.
Anything new?
Nothing really, huh.
Just more of the same
You’d think another day would
Bring changes
But fuck that
Everything is just fine
Just like always

Hello Nine A.M.
I’m going back to bed.
Notice I didn’t say sleep
I don’t know where that is
Good night, Nine A.M.
See you tomorrow.
If you’re lucky.


In January the sun is out early
The heat is like spring
But it’s January.
My throat is protesting.
My throat is a raw hamburger football
Kicking around in a parking lot full of metal heads.
They pass a black leather studded bottle around
And take turns
Throwing my throat at each other.
In January, the sickness found me
Happy Birthday, self.
I hope you’re happy.



I hear children and vacuums
Through the walls of the next apartment
How I long for them
To become one.



Burn, burn on down.
Bourbon down.
One to go.
On down.
One more.
That’s all.
Just one more.
For the road.



Radio Silence
In times of crisis
Like waiting for a call
Cutting through the static.
Fuck.
Fuck radio silence.









Restful eyes and I, not so much
A hiccup nap in sleep’s great coughing fit
For a king would simply order it so
But just as well, I’ve run dry
A pill, a pillow, a puddle between
My legs and all I have left is
Meh.
Whatever man.
See you tomorrow.
Flushed face, lever down leave it to Beaver
Fine dining marathon betwixt your thighs
And eyes again, closed and open mouth
For heavy breath and heaving breast when
Twin hills point accusingly at the
Ceiling.
Now that’s what I call breakfast.
Gee Wally.
And his waffles were slathered with syrup.



One can down and some time ago
I can’t remember when.
Clutter can of memory loss
And five cents of redemption
From the land of Blue Waters.

One cigarette left
One thirty in the morning
One pack for three days
I must be getting old.
Or I would have smoked it already.



Every time the phone makes a sound
I think, maybe it’s one of my women.
But it’s only B-Ray. And he wants to know about a printer.
I don’t have a goddamn printer.
I don’t have anything worth printing.
Especially not all those letters to women.
The ones that never garnered a response.
Or all the stories.
The ones that have been rejected by magazines.
Judged unfit for print.
I don’t have a goddamn printer.



Blood finger is a sign of carelessness.
But oh well, I was in a hurry.
I can shit tomorrow.
The house smells great
Like chicken soup
Which is tomorrow
No work and all the time in the world
Hurray for days off.
Hurray for shit and chicken soup.



This is the tenth cigarette I’ve smoked in bed
Since the last time I emptied the ash tray.
There are no bottles or cans next to my bed.
A sad sign that this is the morning of pay day.
When I can’t afford to be drunk at five a.m.
When I need it most.



According to the clock
I can sleep seven hours before
Rock and Roll Radio wakes me up.
Lunch hour DJ good morning Rock and Roll
Are you ready to rock and roll out of bed?
Everyone else has already eaten their sandwiches
I hope you’re ready to rock steady
Because now it’s noon, you have to roll into work
The radio wills it.
Rock and Roll Radio.



The boss called me Emo today.
I think he was just calling my hair names.
My hair responses apathetically as usual.
My hair has no feelings
Least of all sad ones
I keep those all to myself
So I can cry myself to sleep
Weeping over my depressing haircut.





Bad scene
With crying girls
And cocaine
Our numbers man with blood on his hands
He saw his window of opportunity
And he punched the sombitch right in the face
And that window had it coming
Believe you me.


Word on the wire is that
My uncle has a year to live
Cancer has begun to eat his body away
He’s a member of the Sierra Club
He’s a proud Scotsman
Even has a kilt
A year from now my uncle will be underground
In a plaid skirt
He’s an avid outdoorsman
And in a year
He will become earth
My uncle has a year to live
I bet he’ll spend a lot of time
Hiking with his wife and grandson.
He will be buried along with his moustache
And his laugh
That belongs more so in a canyon
Than confined in a coffin.



I feel like a marionette
Hanging by a thread that’s wrapped
Around my neck
And You’re pulling the strings.



Tequila drinkers next to me on the south train.
Tequila is good for
The passionate and the young.
Whiskey is better for broken dreamers
“No salt! Sugar.  And lemon.  Just like tea.”





In my bed instead of you
I have three good books
Two notebooks, a pen, a phone
Cigarettes, an ashtray a lighter
And two cans of beer.
And a pint of whiskey.
Stories to read, a place to write stories
A means for communication
And sources of intoxication
Just like you.
But not as warm
And much more quiet.
And spread out
Silent as a streetlight
In the gutter
Next to my bed.



Seven thirty
Thank god I bought bitters
What a wonderful accoutrement
To garnish my lack of sleep.
With ice and whiskey
In a little blue mug
Meant for camping trips
Or prison camps.
Or trips to prison
Without tents
Without visiting hours.


Almost back out, finally
I came back in
Realizing that my bladder
Has a four hour time limit
A good nap.  But not much else.
Tempted to sneaky Pete my way through work
Bourbs and ginger ale
Dash of bitters
Twist of lemon
The Jessica Special
From a special Jessica.





The most tragic of things
Is sleeping next to someone
Of great personal significance
Unable to sleep
Because my heart won’t stop pounding
Because I’m not used to sleeping with
Someone
So I lay awake
Holding a dream come true
As close as possible
Because in the morning, you never know
In the morning anything can happen
And I’d rather lie in bed
Holding my dream
Then deal with work
Or social obligations.
I’d rather drift in and out of consciousness
But never make it all the way out
Life is too short to wake up from this



If neglecting me was a profitable enterprise
You’d be a millionaire by now.
Someday, I hope I don’t care about you
As much as you don’t care about me.
One of these days, someone else will give a damn.



In Recent Memory of Trout Fishing in America.

Cold steel spinning bait thrown out
Overcastting a line to the opposite shore
Where the lure slaps at a rock before
Tumbling into a gap between the stones
Where the line snaps
And my lure is lost
Between two moss slicked stones
And the water moves along
With rapid apathy.







Sometimes, I feel as though
I should keep every good thing that
Happens to me.
A secret.
Because if anyone finds out
It may all just disappear.
Like the flame from
A birthday candle
Right After my wish
Comes true.



Cold medication.
Do you really do anything?
Supposedly you suppress coughs
And colds
But my face still leaks
Just the same
I tried four bowls of
Spicy soup
To drain away my nose
To no avail
Cold medicine
Whiskey rocks ginger ale
Rock a bye baby
Rock me to sleep
Where the cold goes away
And in the morning I wake
Or just lie in wait of morning.



Chubby checker barfly
Is just another one of you.
Gave me her number and everything.
On a napkin I’ll never use
Because I’m just not attracted to you.
Sorry sweetheart.
I’m a little bitter.
It would never work out anyway.
You should probably get drunk and forget
About me.
It’s for the best
Of both worlds
Yours and mine.


The cough came back
Come to think of it
I’m not so sure it ever left
But there it is again
At nine fifteen
Like a kiss good morning
Blown from the diseased hand
Of a leaper lying through
Teeth
Of orthodontic appeal
Brace yourself
For a perfect fit.



I met a man named Joe
And another man named Natto
I don’t remember anything we said
Bar talk is cheaper
Than the drinks.



Is there a luxury greater
Than smoking in bed?
All the money in the world
Perhaps
Or shiny cars
That smell like pine trees
Pine trees that are too
Expensive to obey speed limits.

















Oh water
Restore me to my feet
My tired feet
That need three more hours
Of restless napping.

Oh water
Bathe me back to life
My tired life that needs rest
Or something like it

Oh water
Wash my glass
Give me the cold shoulder
And become ice cubes
Chill the whiskey
And water it down
Until the glass is
Only half full



Six thirty
Is no time for this shit
Or anything. Really.
Stupid ears
Why can’t you clean yourselves?
Why?
Not.



I sleep behind America.
Well, I would be sleeping behind America
But I can’t do that.
I’d rather sleep next to
Sleep with America
But America is just a flag
That is always sleeping
Unlike me
Who is always waking up.







My hand smells like my balls.
That’s predictable.
It’s reasonable.
Especially on a Sunday morning
When everything should smell like my balls.




Mike has a cold instead of a cat
Or a dog (or a bitch)
He had a ferret once
Last year or the one before
Can’t remember
It’s been a while
His cold gave birth to a litter
Of coughs and sneezes
And a few fevers
I took a cough home with me
He’s about six months old
I feed my cough cigarettes and beer.
He sleeps on my bed and bathes with me
In the shower
I’m not so fond of him.
But we’ve become attached to each other
I might raise him till he matures
Maybe into a cold
Or a disease
Or lung cancer
Who knows.
Maybe he’ll run away
And join the hospital.

I took my scrotum out for a spin
The other day.
It was getting dusty
Down in the garage.
The check engine light came on
All the mechanics wanted too much money
So I sat in the garage
With the motor running.
Until the light went out.






This poem is totally going to be five lines long.
That’s real talk, I ain’t jiving you. Seriously
I wouldn’t pull that shit on you.  You’re too nice
But after five lines we’re calling it quits.
“It’s pretty cool, being five lines long,” said this poem.
“You’re such a liar,” I said.



I hope the sleep study calls me back
I hope she lives with regrets
I hope I go out like fireworks
I hope Modern Drunkard likes my story
I hope the band goes on tour
I hope I can keep my job for a while
I hope this room lasts a while
I hope they find a cure
I hope I’m right about god
I hope she loves me




If all lines continue infinitely
Going on and on into the night
Then where do you draw the line?
How do you cross it?
Can a line be picked up?
Can it be stolen
Inhaled
Can it be traded bought, sold etc
Fuck Continuity



They have cutting rooms
For movies
But I want to start a dive bar
With that name
The Cutting Room
The décor would be very morbid.
The patrons would giggle about suicide.



I love everything about the morning
Except when it takes place.

The Misfits.

We exist by division,
Conflicting definitions,
Spracked out day dream hangover victims.

On restroom walls
Manifestos pass for graffiti;
These chicken scratch chronicles
Sold from the trunk of a stolen Mercedes.

Wild on whiskey we howl at a full moon
And laugh like shattering glass.
The sounds of defiance waft heavenward
Like so many billowy clouds
Of Cigarette smoke.

With hash crazy red-eyes
We peer into crystal strip malls
Pray to nothing in particular
And laughing, always laughing.
Just another saliva soaked finger
Singing on the rim of a wine glass.

I hear voices around every corner
That sound like stale beer,
Nestled in aluminum prisons
Half consumed under the unholy
Lidless, listless gaze
Of everything we hold
Dear.

She cuts her lip on a Zig-Zag
And slices her tongue amidst
The screams of so much
White noise.
She stands on a balcony
Bathed in the blood
Of her ever open mouth.

We watch her dive like a china doll
With less than horror
In her eyes;
We sigh with envy
At her calm complacency
And her dream
Of a beautiful
Suicide.

II
We gather again at the end of our wits;
Make plans  for a wake.
I polish my minister�s badge
And write for her, a eulogy.

She rests now; coffin bound in robes so silky sheen.
Obscene scenesters hang their heads
Half in sorrow, half from the weight
Awaiting words regurgitated
Little chicks unable to chew, they sit on pews
Sending text messages.

Throat cleared now and hrumph hum hum.
You are not my dearly beloved,
My brothers and sisters and not family by any means.
End now this silly charade and claim again
Your birthright;
Which is just to live as you see fit.

Fuck you and your attention span.
Fuck you in your head, not listening.
Fuck you and your precious festering wounds.
Your puckered lips are a cat�s asshole.
Your words fall short like little shits
Sticking to the fur.
I watch you when you fuck or copulate.
Bang, buck, punk, pork, poke, prod your prick
Into musk scented love sockets.
You are my pornography,
Lying in a casket.

III

Days and weeks pass and skid
Grind by, halting here and there.
Rap at a window late night
Let�s me know the time is right.

A brick as thick as it gets smashes the silence
Red smatter shattering pane
She reaches in and grabs me by the neck
Drags me under a shot out street lamp.
We camp a minute, flicking bics.
And inhale deep down,
Returning wide eyed and ready.

Grasping hands we run off into pitch black
Promises of promiscuous perversions.
She hangs a leg out of the window of a car
Letting wind whip her three days unshaven legs.
Her face facing starry ceiling
Sings a battle cry at hitch hikers;
A thumbs up serenade
To the tune of Isn�t it Romantic

We drive a hot hatchback into the waves
And cheer at mermaids.
Bastet sits on the shore
Basking in the glow
Of our collective cheerful absurdity.

She runs thin nicotine stained fingers
Through hat perfect hair,
Kisses her finger tips
And muahs at nothing at all.
Give �em hell, give �em hell
And break the spell of boredom.

Badass china doll face breaks no fasts
In the lanes of the happy highways
Pulling blind corners, pausing
Only to lurch four letter words off the tongue of a mute.

We shoot shit like it means something.
These small talk soliloquies have only the dim reflection
Of it�s so nice to see you again.
Now motionless lips and wandering eyes,
Indulging in the semi-awkward silence.


West cliff

There’s a lighthouse on the point.
The beacon years out of use
It stands majestically neglected
Lacking in ships to guide in
Replaced now by years decades of navigational technology.

It’s true what they say
How you only see couples when you’re single
Their happiness in direct proportion to how lonely
You are when they pass by, arm in arm
Hand in Hand
Lips to Lips.

Out of eye corners I keep catching glimpses
Of golden curled short strawberry blondes.
The face is never right
Or the figure.
But I still double take
Look again just to check
Knowing full well the impossible implications

There’s this lighthouse on the point.
The city turned it into a surf museum.
Someday I’d like to take you there
And hold, embrace kiss you deep
While a swell curls, breaks and crashes
On the rocks below,
Sending snowy foam wave debris scattered
Upwards and out.
Grasping in vain at the seagulls
That refuse to do anything but shit everywhere
And Soar away.


(untitled)

You can try to hold it waiting for a moment
A space a place in time
A spot so quiet that you dare to scream
No one calls the cops out of fear
For the one guy doing what’s on everyone’s mind.

Engage this sense desensitized
And realize for the first and last time
That these dreams so fading with waking
And split second stops


For Ben Raymond

History Repeating
A ballad sent forth from the lips
The thrusting hips of water closet hookups
Of drunken game spit
Of empty bottle balancing acts
Of Cigarette butt happy endings
All the while in tie and funeral shirt
The great observer taking notes
On eavesdropped conversation snippets.
The modern writer, on track minding a storehouse of memories
That orbit around the previous center of the universe
The sun around the earth despite science
In spite of logic and lunacy
Always in transition to hangover
Tickling a notebook to coax out clichés
Reworded to subtle brilliance.


For Moe Moe

She walks like a jukebox
Whistle then hums then singing out loud
The top forty hits echoing off housing structures
All alone taking courage by breaking the dead of night silence
Of Foreigner decent, shedding the remnants of common decency
And the strangers looking on at her vocal straining lunacy.

Nose in a book always
Eyes tracing retracing the same paragraph
She bums out filters by request
Lamenting the new voids in a quickly draining half pack.

And sustenance dictates departure
While shame faced dumb dogs nap in the back of station wagons
We drain a twelve pack in her parking lot
And ill lit games of hacky sack refuse to end

Swill with us this two buck chuck
And Duck swaps jokes between swigs of beer
With a tossed brunette boy, restless and awaiting
Road trips.







For Bitchnuts.

The patron saint of strip clubs
Beer guzzling bald headed
Receding hairline harbinger.
I held you up post bull riding
As you staggered force footed up the stairs
Into the caring arms of cousins who love you.

Bury your face in the massive flesh pillows
After awkward shower sex scenes.
My windbreaker is somewhere on your floor
Somewhere between the Maxims and Bud Light bottles
Burnt out butts on your balcony.

My would be brother in law
Empty rum bottle battles
On clock intoxicated escapades
And dangerous flirtations with no longer underage waitresses.
I could palm her whole ass one handed.

Half Asian half sisters and you on the floor
With the man stealing ho bag.
And the bitchy roommate that called me creepy
When really she’s just a shitty hostess
And a filthy little mudshark
Downloading Counting Crows songs on the couch.

Pervasive pole dancer leaves jaws dropped
Girls with envy.
The culmination of years of study
And rows of dollar bill pyramids.
Movie quoting manwhore.
Bitch nuts forever and I hope you never grow up.
















Pac Ave.

Pacific Avenue is my real home.
Where I go no matter how I feel
To be distracted in your bookshops
To waste countless hours between a half dozen cafes.

To devour all those slices from Rockers, Pizza and Grille, Pizza My Heart.
I love you and your kelp’d beaches
Your bumming Boardwalk, filthy sidewalk littered with tourists.
Your bums harass me constantly
The street urchins refuse to let me be
For cigarettes, spare change, petition signatures
Bus fare and booze money.
You panhandling persistent poor
I wish you’d just get a fucking job
And Leave me alone.

Santa Cruz, you are a paradox unto yourself
An enigma never at peace
I don’t like it when you tone it down
I like you wild and weird,
Your grown up hippies and all too quickly matured street kids
I miss you when I leave
I’d kiss you goodbye but I’m not so fond of disease
I’ll blow it your way flying down 17
Watch you catch it between what remains of your meth stained teeth.


Heartbreaker

What she lacks in chest
She makes up for in legs and ass.
Change color hair, straight and elegant
With deep brown doe eyes that hypnotize and tease

She’s a hell of a saleswoman
And a gold digging bitch.
She’ll show up on your doorstep at three in the morning
Looking scared and helpless.

Barfly and hellion, hell raiser and Helen of Troy
We gave you a nine point two and clapped when you walked in the room
Oblivious heartbreaker
And I timed my smoke breaks around you;
Always a perfect gentleman.




For Mikey

Gazing towards heaven,
But it’s only space.
Empty infinite boarding school for Stars.
And I linger on
Lying on the floors of saints
Wallowing in their unclean carpets
Wishing on a painted moon
I wake only to find
The fading memory of a dream
That left me blue balled.


The Scientific Method.

It’s thirty-six inches from me to you.
Measuring tape seldom lies. Retracts with a snap
Recoils and whirs.
Extending again to find the extent
And no, not the former habitat of past camping trips.
Stretch up and out to cards long ago shuffled
And it’s sixty-three inches from you to aces.
Misplaced poker hands stuck with invisible adhesives
Making a map of potential pot winners
Granting solace to chip holders.
We measure again a means to an end
It’s fifty-four inches before you go.
The distance to broken doorways with still working locks
Soon passing through your feet clad in shoes
Or your sole bared in flip-flops.



















On Sexual Frustration.

Big fan of summertime
Summertime with short skirts
And low riding hip huggers
Halter top heroin
Just let me inject interjections
And rejection junkies on a sidewalk fix.

Cleavage peeks from the bosoms and blossoms
Tank top titters and sniggering giggles
Give rise, give rise
And Christ alive a little release.

Meticulously catalog the hunched over
Un-pantied ass cracks,
Pleasant distractions compliments of Levi Strauss.
I can’t protest the way women dress
In this season of heat.
You can only admire, be pleased by the tease;
Sultry skin scenes played out between shoulder blades.

Leggy lovers spreading rumors amongst other things.
Only imagine the treasures hidden under very impractical shorts.
Eye catching ankle tattoos give me kicks
And people watching is always cheaper than strip clubs.
Until you get home, dead bolted door behind you
And engage in purely utilitarian masturbation rituals
Sowing your seeds in crumpled tissues
Just to empty out excess body fluids.
