"One day you will watch it all fall away, and you will be left with only that which truly is." He said, his sad old man eyes gleaming like sad blue diamonds in twin caves. 
He's such a sad old man. 
Hard to look at sometimes. 
Why he chose me to rattle his folk ramble whims, I haven't the slightest clue, unless it has to do with my passive enjoyment of his regular flow of semi-irregular babble. 
But he was so precise in his seemingly chaotic expression that I could never quite tell if he were reciting a pre-written diatribe or some classic monologue, or just his own special ramblings. 
Today he was talking about friends, and groups. 
Never get all six of them to the same barbecue again. 
But that's not true. 
"Not true til proven true." He'd say, "And you prove it true every day." And I feel it wrench from my hands, memories and patterns and morning routines and afternoon meet up spots. 
God, what a depressing old man, making me think all mushy. 
I got up and walked out, walked a mile to the edge of town. 
Found the hillside we used to climb with 40s. 
So much of this feels empty now. 
I feel thin and hollow.
Not hungry, empty.
I want to vomit my response across the sky to the world, a collage mural of my analysis. 
I want to explain myself.

AUTHORS NOTE :::::: SHANGRI LA AND THEO JAMES : An Intro concerning the origins of the Author
We were all born in a little town called Shangri La California. 
Unaware of our incapacity to age, we treated ourselves like mortals, eventually convincing ourselves and thus transforming ourselves. 
Some found this result in travels, others in stationary trending. 
Something keeps them, us; from realizing and accepting. 
This dark wet hesitance that lays on our gumption like a lead vest.
Theo James spent years teaching us his logics on the redwood deck and under the covered bridge. 
He was always around and ready to explain just why it was we weren't allowed to say certain words or sing certain songs. 
"This is the Age of Appearance. 
We have become aware of the literal application of human programming, and have tied it directly to superficial expression, thus presentation supplants reality." He spoke often of ages, and often spoke on the concept of ages. 
"An Age lasts as long as a generation. 
between the time you're born and the time you make a baby is a generation. 
See, an Age only lasts until it's replaced, but there are always a series of Ages occurring at once, and it can be said that all previous Ages that have occurred are now happening simultaneously, and any new Age only adds to the din. 
This continues until we take a dimensional shift and accept all Ages as occurring simultaneously, which will complicate our theory of time and various other seemingly transparent matters." 
We were too young to get most of it. 
fourteen, sixteen, eighteen. 
Even at twenty, we still just kept him near as a side kick eccentric, and never as a great teacher. 
Maybe that was intentional though. 
He said all truth comes in the form of punch lines, but he wasn't that funny, which kind of suggests that he was full of shit. 
But his favorite underdog is the failed inventor, finding thousands of new and unexpected ways to not quite do what he was hoping. 
Failure is just a negative expression of discovery. 
"Not to say that all discovery is positive. 
Quite the opposite. 
Choosing your realm mode and style of discovery is vital to maintaining a positive self perpetuating pattern."
I refuse to describe him, because you would stop listening. 
You would shrug off his input as obscene and absurd. 
You would condemn him based on an incapacity to integrate. 
"Ennit funny how I'm the one who can't seem to integrate, but I'm the only one who's still friends with everybody? How is that not integrating? That's better than integrating. 
It's assimilation." The town loved him, but hated all that he stood for, and he could never hold clear how he felt about the town. 
Sweet mad Shangri la California, No duplicate exists in all the realms of all the mythologies of evermore. 
Nowhere else are all the girls cursed to live betwixt some sort of forest nymph fairy experience of the sprawling redwood womb of these woods. 
Nowhere else do the young men go mad and run screaming up and down the streets in search of the demon that's taken hold of their boot strings. 
One man lives on the hill. 
He paces his sandstone ridge and digs worry lines with his feet, deep enough for the satellites to see. 
He does not remember why he left, or what he hoped to find. 
All he remembers is why it's not safe down there in the town.
Another man lives in a hole by the river. 
He whistles at night to call spirits to him, hoping they'll tell him stories darker than his. 
He doesn't remember when he fell away, or why he would want to be any other way, but he knows more than he's willing to hold, and looks for ways to loosen it. 
Sweet mad Shangri La California, mother of chaotic children of fury, lost in the mourning of moments unhinging. 
He stabbed Melvin here, thirteen years ago today. 
Don't look at the date. 
It's not your birthday anymore. 
Perhaps that's the line you're looking for. 
It's no longer a magical holiday. 
The fairies are gone, and the demons now play. 
In the tilted the falling the whim of the way. 
We battle the burgeoning depths of decay, send innocence stumbling back on her way.
It's a mad cap mount 'em shut em down party town that won't stop breakin shit and shattering and scattering the semblance of knowledge compiled and held,
softly tightly in secret queit pauses, hiding the raw depth of raw. 
Not mine. 
Not me. 
Not here, no how no way.
-----------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION TO THE WRITING STYLE OR LACK THEREOF
There once was a time when I'd fly off the handle and run to my notebook to scramble down thoughts. 
There once was a time when that's all that I wanted, that's all that I sought in my daily onslaught of wandering whatnot. 
At a certain point i forgot what I wanted. 
My notes became clouded and scrambled. 
One note sends me through thick heavy words of past masters, reminding me of my capacities to speak intellectually to the up and ups, the educated, the echelon. 
Another note pulls me towards awareness, not tied to the patterns and myths of society, not caught in the rat trap of repitition, rather baiting my subconscious so as to launch it off into realms unknown in hopes of bringing back thoughts of worth.
I used to listen to strangers talk on the bus and jot down their conversations, no matter how bland and empty. 
Simply tracking the interaction of strangers, my third role permanizing the occurence for all time. 
What do I do now? I look at the words on the page and gauge my connection to them and their capacity to reflect that which is. 
The expressive loop lacks the flesh of literal experience, and the author is forced to throw in some sort of actual occurrence to bring the reader back to something that actually exists apart from language.
This is a very specific intro written by a writer who claims not to write, and yet he writes daily. 
He jots down and struggles with cover letters and business plans and project management logics, but his words are no longer the feather spark fliers that waltz across the sky and burn the eyes of every unwitting passerby. 
He has quit every project he started, calling them off with a vague "post-poned!" unwilling to accept anything as disowned. 
But this is a moment of realism. 
A moment frozen in time. 
This is now and post-poned means dead, abandoned, and irrelevant. 
The development of past projects can be justified as partial projects aimed at developing project capacities, and this to a certain extent is true, but competion and release are the things that have kept the author frozen in this loop of managerial ramblings. 
He's trying. 
He really is. 
He's always known how to start. 
You sit down, get excited, follow the flow and don't bother crossing your eyes, but dotting your t's is fine. 
Manifest. 
Manifest with zest gusto gumption and puzaz. 
We are not tracing delicate veins here. 
We are not slicing open the mucose membrane of the mylean sheath to see the literal pathways of thought, rather we are throwing our subconscious out of a plane and letting it scream its dying words as it hurtles earthward. 
We are bringing ourselves into a mental picture that we convince ourselves is real to prompt what possible reaction we might have to such a thing. 
Last visit home I read the paper and saw that an old man had died falling off a cliff that overlooked the river above a bridge by a certain hairpin curve. 
I pondered the thought and found myself there 10 years prior. 
"I been there!" I said to my dad. 
"I climbed that cliff, and almost fell. 
Almost died like he did!" Seemingly meaningless drivel. 
His moment of death was preceded ten years by my moment on that same cliff side, sliding and frantically clinging to tiny seedling trees, unsure for the first time ever, whether I'd make it. 
Just another tiny meaningless trigger tracing paths and possibilities as occurrences continue to accrue along the infinite stretching tongue of paper our pens play across, skidding along, hesitant to stop, for in stagnation is death and the sliding earth beneath us brings us closer to the cliff by the bridge overlooking a certain hairpin curve. 
------------------------------------------------
Chapter 1  JUNK THRU SKAT   Berkeley, 2008
I walk into the living room which is graced by my mattress, which in turn is encircled by stacks of notebooks torn fragments of stories and drifting bits of poetry. 
A sloppy expanding cradle of crumpled papers. 
I grab another beer and crumple into my mess of a nest. 
My free hand finds a pen and a scrap of paper. 
What’ll it be this time? A poem perhaps.
JUNK
After six sexless months
Your junk begins to look like just that.
A broken down rusted out ford
Forgotten in the vacant lot
Between your legs.
There’s a unique sense of satisfaction I achieve by writing this. 
I still feel like shit. 
But it’s my shit. 
Shit happens. 
And hey, what’s a little shit between friends? 
I think it’s Monday. 
Probably time I left the house. 
It’s been two days since I’ve even seen the outside. 
My sleep has been sporadic to say the least. 
I’ve been checking whether it’s AM or PM. 
That’s no good. 
No bueno. 
So I grab my junk and open the front door. 
Just as I expected. 
Nothing’s changed. 
I’m not sure how I feel about life’s incessant consistency. 
I decide to remain passive and just walk to campus. 
The slow steady pattern of one foot after another always helps to heal the headspace.
When Walt Disney was a kid, he would use tar to paint cartoon animals on the side of his father’s barn. 
That is fucking beauty. 
That is immortal. 
It might be a bullshit story invented by his biographers to make him seem more palatable. 
But the concept is pure. 
Perhaps that’s why I’m trying to do, capture that purity. 
Not the innocence, No, that’s long gone. 
But the sudden impulse. 
They’ve called it “Poetic Genius” and clever names like that, but I call it gumption.
Gumption is the power to exist. 
The generational belly fire. 
The electric vibrations of eyes to wide and jaw too tight. 
On a mountain side or beneath a streetlight, it’s the flashing brilliance of thought and desperate creation. 
Skidding through the kitchen, switching off the stove so as to prolong the writing binge. 
Fire under food might pull me from the writing room.
Gumption is every single word you’ve written for no one but yourself. 
The shit that comes because it has to. 
Not because they’ll buy it, or maybe start to like you. 
Fuck them. 
They just wanna fuck you and then shit on you. 
That’s what they do. 
Every single time. 
First they fuck you, then they shit on you. 
Don’t bother being popular. 
It’s like masturbating at the punch table and yelling to the hostess, “This party’s great!”
It makes me think of an art piece I saw once. 
The MOMA, perhaps? In England? Five years ago. 
It was a video of the artist, naked and alone, wearing nothing but boxing gloves and a mask. 
He keeps trying to masturbate with the boxing gloves, but when that fails, he pummels himself in the face until he falls to the ground. 
It seems like he set the whole thing up. 
By himself. 
In a dark drunken stupor. 
I hope I never get that drunk. 
It reminds me morbidly of videos sent by lonely young women to their men in Iraq, to visually say “your lady still loves you.” Except this was a nameless artist, sending his meaningless masochism across half a century to me. 
At the time I thought the entire piece was just a cry for attention. 
Now, I figure it’s a graphic display of how our creative drive (sex) when stifled becomes a destructive drive (masochism) …
I decide that walking isn’t helping, so I find the closest bus stop and begin the waiting. 
I check my watch, check the schedule, and decide I don’t care. 
I sit on the bench waiting for something to hit me. 
For half a second I expect it to be bird shit, but nothing. 
No occurence of any mentionable kind. 
My head slowly goes from left to right, and back to center, scanning the streets for something of interest. 
Nothing. 
I pull out my notebook and flip through the pages. 
Disgusting. 
No, disappointing. 
There’s a few pieces I like, but I suddenly hate them, because they claim to be done. 
And yet, certain sentences insist on wearing army boots, stomping along through the flower garden of emotion I try to lay down. 
…why do I consistently hate my writing?
Good lord, the world swims before me. 
Everything keeps sliding out of place. 
But I find my way onto the bus without a scene. 
I shuffle to the back and find a good spot with a window to lean against. 
Out comes the notebook, and I scramble down a sloppy doodle face. 
A quick crummy doodle face. 
But the bus is too bumpy and sends my pen skittering in senseless directions. 
I put my notebook away and pull out a book, but can’t hardly see the words. 
So back that goes too, and I lean my head against the window. 
The vibrations rattle my brain, and soon I abandon this position.
I’m sitting in a good spot so as to glance. 
There’s a cute brunette at the front. 
I’m good at this game. 
It’s a shitty game, but I have to be good at something, and apparently I’ve lost the will to masturbate. 
So instead I gaze affectionately at strangers. 
Not straight at them. 
That’s where the game comes in. 
Part of riding the bus is leaning your head against the window. 
If your head isn’t leaned against the window, you’re not actually riding the bus. 
The other part of riding the bus is the fantastic reflections. 
With your face so close to the window, you appear to be looking out. 
This fools your fellow passengers into a relaxed state, and you are free to observe, through the ghost whisper of the window’s reflection. 
This is the game.
Today I’m not actually riding the bus. 
My back is straight. 
Well, slouched. 
But not against the window. 
The brunette has her head cushioned by a knit beanie, leaning against the window. 
But I doubt she knows about the game. 
She wears a pea coat, and she seems on her way home from class, to enjoy soup and crackers or some such nonsense. 
At first I examine her from my peripherals. 
Quickly I realize that she’s distracted by something. 
I have a sneaking suspicion as to what it might be, and I deftly execute a brilliant maneuver. 
I look at her reflection in the opposite window instead of at her, and she jumps with electric embarrassment. 
I caught her studying my ghost whisper. 
Secretly observing me. 
I have won the game.
I get off at the next stop feeling clever, mysterious, awkward and stupid. 
Man, what a shitty game. 
I don’t even know where I got off. 
Doesn’t matter. 
Space is irrelevant. 
Right now, Time needs movement. 
I sit at the bus stop, waiting for the next bus, and write a little two page story about a kid who gets kicked off the bus because he has an evil sex-leprechaun who keeps yelling dirty things at cute girls. 
Goddamn sex leprechaun. 
I read through it twice, and hate it. 
I scratch out a line here, circle a phrase there. 
AWK and REWORD and EXPOUND litter the page like graffiti. 
I picture the story written on a bathroom wall. 
I picture gangsters going in with sharpies and critiquing it. 
I like this image. 
I hold onto it, and watch the gangsters, nodding, cradling their chins. 
And just as quick as it came, I become frustrated with it. 
There’s nothing I can do with it! It’s not a story or a song or a painting. 
It’s a fucking fantasy about gangsters reworking my piece. 
Shit! I can’t do a damn thing with that.
Deciding to walk, I slip my pad into my back pack and begin my slow trek towards campus. 
Thoughts are made easy with moving feet. 
I can leave them behind with whatever I’m passing. 
The sex leprechaun drops in to the gutter and scuttles off down a storm drain. 
The gangster critics disperse towards the BART station as I cross the street. 
I let the brunette go, and watch her get snagged in a tree, barren of leaves.
Meaningless melodies flitter through now. 
Not actual songs. 
No. 
That would require some sort of attention. 
Some acknowledgement of thought. 
No, it’s just a sort of “Be Diddle Diddle Whop Whop Zang…” Keeping pace with my aimless feet. 
The feeling of relief brought on by my little skat song frustrates me enormously. 
It’s called skat singing because it’s shit! Linguistic doodle poops. 
Scat! Dammit!!
As I continue my trek I slump into the same fucking mind game that keeps crawling in. 
Why the fuck do I bother? I like my sad little poem about my penis. 
But why in God’s name would I write something like that? What does it do? It ain’t gonna save lives. 
It might make someone crack a smile. 
I guess it’s alright. 
I especially like the comparison of colors. 
Rust isn’t quite right, but it’s closer than White…  But who gives a fuck about the color of my penis? That’s sick! This isn’t literature, it’s absolute nonsense! Shit! It’s fucking Shit!! But maybe… maybe it’s just not done yet. 
Maybe I could develop it. 
Use the whole white concept as a parallel to the white washed tombs that Jesus compared the Pharisees to. 
Than I could use rust as a symbol of decay and dysfunction. 
Entropy. 
And bring that around to show that we are living a lie unless we acknowledge our flaws. 
Yeah… That’s something, right?  …  What the fuck am I even saying?
Why am I trying so hard to write? To create? To leave a sprawling trail of all the words and thoughts that once passed this way. 
It’s all shit. 
It’s all fucking shit! But then again, maybe it’s supposed to be shit. 
Shit is a necessary thing. 
I mean, you gotta release the shit. 
Otherwise it builds up, and that could cause a rupture. 
Or blindness. 
No, masturbation causes blindness. 
What does shit do? I heard somewhere that shit makes the flowers grow. 
I can dig it.
I end up forming a little word game. 
I write for two reasons. 
Either it’s due, or it’s something to do. 
But either way it’s just doo doo. 
According to time, the past is fecal matter, and the future is food.
I tromp along digesting this, satisfied that it’s at least something. 
It’s all shit. 
Even Milton and Shakespeare and everyone ever, all the way back to the first guy to put stylus to papyrus. 
They’ve all just been streaking their little chicken feet letterings along like turdstains on toilet paper.
I can’t find an empty page. 
Oh wait, here’s one. 
No, it’s stained through with sharpie. 
And that page has a splattering of resin, where I once gathered the remains of weed smoking that stain the insides of pipes with clumps of black build up. 
It’s smokable, but it gives a real stupid high. 
Like you can’t even watch cartoons. 
It’s shit. 
The shit that weed smoke leaves behind. 
And I scrape it out of my pipe and smoke it to get high. 
Dammit! Shit Everywhere! Even my drugs are just the shit left over from old drugs!  …   I write a quick shitty poem on the resin page…
Resin
Shit
You are what you eat.
This is one of those poems that I’ll never share with anyone. 
I might keep it around, glance at it now and again. 
Remind myself that I disable my true potential. 
But for now I smoke resin. 
‘cause than I’m stupid, and that means I’ll stop thinking. 
Oh, what a glorious thought. 
Once again, I feel walkably better, and I continue on my pedestrian way.
As I walk I savor the thought of not thinking. 
I begin counting steps, just so that I’ll have harmless numbers echoing in my skull instead of my melodramatic psycho-philosophical masturbations.
At last I reach the gas station. 
The first pause, the daily greeting, the purchasing of cigarettes and energy drink. 
These motions reassure me. 
I know how to do something. 
This exchange brings me back to feeling functional. 
Something. 
Substantial.
And the sight of the black and white tiling slides me. 
I look up and once again notice that Gas stations, like Safeways, are all the same. 
On a bad one you might forget what town you’re in. 
I glance around, then close my eyes and hear the hum of the drink fridges, and I remember the other place. 
Feugit, California. 
I recently met someone from Feugit. 
A fellow Feugit native. 
A fellow Feugitive. 
“Yeah, I guess I’m from Feugit,” he said, “But I do what I can to forget it.” I guess I feel the same sometimes. 
Otherwise why would I be here in Berkeley. 
I musta said that at some point. 
Fuck Feugit. 
Forget it.
But this goddamn gas station sends me there. 
I stare at the back wall, away from the windows, picturing Feugit outside of this station. 
Why Feugit? Why not? What was different?
I do not know…
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chapter 2 Charlie Tomorrow   Feugit, 2003
Another forgettable slow Saturday afternoon. 
Hungover, Shambled. 
I stopped in at the same ol’ fuckin gas station to get some of the ol’ cup o’ noodles. 
They got a big sign out front that says “Same Ol’ Fuckin Gas Station”. 
I love that sign. 
72 cents left over form the night before, which managed to crawl five or six hours into today, but the guy behind the counter pretended like it was enough for the warm wonderful cup of recovery. 
I walked out of the gas station, to the edge of the parking lot, where the lawn from the park comes up to. 
I wandered across the large field to the swing set. 
I needed something that sways, so as to synch up with the unstable earth still sliding around beneath me.
A little blonde kid with a band aid on his forehead walked up and took the swing next to me, and he just starts talking. 
“My name is Charlie. 
I have a Batman action figure. 
My dad says it’s a doll, but it’s not. 
It’s an action figure.” I looked over at Charlie and nodded.
“My dad used to say the same thing.”
“Do you like Batman?”
“Everyone likes Batman.”[Soft Break]“Not my sister.”
“Yeah, but I’ll bet she’s real weird though.”
“Yeah. 
She’s pretty weird. 
Do you like jokes?”
“Absolutely.” I said. 
“Why? You know a good one?”
“Yeah. 
It’s a knock knock joke.”
“Alright. 
Let’s hear it.”
“Will you remember me tomorrow?”
“What? Yeah, I guess. 
I thought it was a knock knock joke.”
“It is. 
That comes later though. 
Jes’ keep going. 
Will you remember me in a year?”
“Pro’lly not, I dunno.”
“Just say yes.” He corrected me. 
“Otherwise it doesn’t work.”
“Alrite. 
Yeah. 
I’ll remember you in a year.”
“Will you remember me in ten years?”
“Without a doubt, Charlie.”
“What about a hundred years?”
“We’ll both be dead than.” My swing stopped. 
I looked over at Charlie. 
He had this expression of half frowning concern. 
Dammit, I’m an asshole.
“I’m sorry Charlie. 
Yeah, I’ll remember you in a hundred years.” But the joke wasn’t funny anymore. 
I had showed by cards, let him know I was secretly a grown up. 
Fuck! I looked down at my shoes, and he followed my gaze. 
Vans high tops that look like snow boots, still squishy wet from some unnamed escapade from the night before.
“I like your shoes.”
“Thanks, Charlie.”
“Why are they wet?”
“I dunno. 
I think I fell in the river last night.”
“You can’t remember?”
“Well… I hit my head when I fell.”
“Oh, and you got nausea?”
“Amnesia. 
Yeah. 
That’s right.” We swung in silence for a few minutes, just letting the sun warm us. 
I kicked off my shoes and peeled off my saturated socks. 
I dangled them towards Charlie, threatening to drape them on him. 
He squealed in playful fear. 
“These are goin straight in the trashcan.”
“You’re gonna just be barefoot all day?”
“Nah, I’ve got some flip flops in the car. 
How old are you Charlie?”
“Seven an a half. 
How old are you?”
“Twenny… Shit! Oh, I’m sorry Charlie. 
It’s just, it sounds weird when I say it. 
Twenny.”
“That’s alrite. 
My dad swears. 
He says that when he talks about his paycheck. 
You don’t seem like twenny. 
You seem like a kid.”
“Thanks Charlie.” It felt good hearing him say that. 
Like I had just received a pardon. 
“You like being a kid?” He picked at the plastic covering the chain of his swing, pondering my query.
“Yeah. 
I like being a kid. 
Grown ups are all super worried, and usually about jobs, and money. 
My only job is to collect snails in the garden, and I get a penny a snail. 
They eat the plants. 
Yeah, being a kid is good. 
My dad is always tired ‘cause he has a job. 
I don’t wanna be tired all the time like that.”
“Yeah, when I was a kid all my friends wanted to grow up. 
They couldn’t wait for kindergarten, than they couldn’t wait for middle school, than they couldn’t wait for high school. 
I knew this barefoot guy who was just always barefoot, and he told me about how humans get stuck in this repeated preparation cycle.”
“Repeated prepration?”
“Yeah. 
You’re smart Charlie. 
What, second grade? So you’re getting ready for third grade, and I’ll bet you can’t wait. 
But the way this barefoot guy described it, everyone just keeps getting ready, waiting for the next thing. 
Gotta be ready for high school, ‘cause that’s when things start happening. 
Gotta be ready for college, ‘cause that decides your entire future. 
Gotta be ready for your twenties, ‘cause you establish your permenant psychological patterns there. 
Gotta be ready for your thirties, ‘cause you’ve passed your peak, and therefore it just gets dimmer and lamer from there. 
Gotta be ready for your forties and fifties and make sure you have a nice plot of land for your burial, and visit it to make sure they aren’t burying people and then moving them years later to resell the same plot… woah. 
Sorry Charlie.”
“That’s alright. 
I didn’t know what most of that meant.”
“Oh. 
Well, that’s good. 
But see, I’m just … I dunno, when I was a kid I had some secret knowledge that no one else had.
I could feel it slipping away.
Just a child with my Charlie Brown lunchbox and beanie with a bobbin.
Just a child with my three favorite fears.
Strangers, the dark, and being alone.
Popsicle stains, scraped knees, missing baby teeth.
But I had something more. 
A very special fear neglected by my childhood peers. 
Age.
Even at five I understood that I would one day die and be buried alone in the dark and be dead.
What scared me were the times I couldn’t remember. 
The days that melt together under the lazy summer sun to the point where a month can go by without barely a memory forged. 
I felt that this was the ultimate wrong. 
Letting our few precious moments slip by without grabbing a moment, a scar, a memory. 
I tried to savor each moment with impulse and franticness, screaming from action to activity.
They didn’t understand. 
The grown ups, they still don’t. 
Their priorities backwards. 
Who has time for these mortals? Testing our knowledge of numbers and states. 
Stupid Bastards! It’s late! Don’t you hear the bells chiming your swift life away?
So I skipped all my homework, got by on my wits. 
Spent weekends and after school trying to save all the precious few moments authority had left me to live my sweet childhood out it.
And than it was gone. 
All of a sudden I was a senior in High School. 
A Sophmore in community college, morning drunk on a swing in the park, barking at a small blonde boy. 
A senior at Cal, a stumbling hungover, out of the gas station into the sun...
------------------------------------------------
Chapter 3 BELLS    BERKELEY, 2008
The sun screams down at me, unhindered by my stupid tree. 
I hear the bells KABONG begin to toll. 
A slow chongy KABONG falls hollowly down. 
KABONG I believe that’s three. 
Although KABONG perhaps I missed the first one. 
KABONG I think I heard the first one. 
Which would make this KABONG six? So that means five left? Wait, what KABONG time is it? Alrite, it’s eleven, and that’s seven, unless I missed the first in which KABONG case that makes eight. 
Or nine now. 
KABONG And that would be ten, unless… why do I KABONG care to react so much? It’s the goddamn KABONG bell and nothing more. 
I’m not late, but I’m all fidgety now, like I’m supposed to be somewhere. 
The bells call me once more, begging me to approach the doors of the church from whence I once crawled to glorious empty freedom…
I feel like I’m late. 
Should I get to the library? No, that’s just my instinct, responding the the bells by approaching the church doors for service. 
The church has been replaced by the towering beast of academia. 
And thus we trade our addictions in for different yet identical direction.
I did the math the other day. 
I’ve been to over thirty five hundred church services. 
It’s been a large part of life for quite awhile now. 
Saints Peter and Paul Orthodox Church, been baptized and brought up inside its extended realm. 
I never really questioned or doubted it. 
Belief can sometimes exist the way people share a blanket. 
But now I’m gone, finding my own warmth, mostly from my sweet glorious belly fire that blazes through all hours of the night.
I never chose Orthodoxy. 
I chose not to resist. 
Well, I chose my battles as all angsty questioners will do. 
I wasn’t a nodder. 
I have the horrible habit of stopping people, and asking them why. 
I see many nodders, still nodding away, sharing the beautiful tapestry blanket of belief, religion, and community. 
Not all of them nodders. 
Many talkers. 
Many interested, many expanding, many understanding. 
But I always, every Sunday, had to resist raising my hand during Homily, asking the pontificating priest, “How can finite actions have infinite consequences?”
Even after the sun has gone down, it’s light outside for at least an hour. 
The world is bluish and dim. 
You go in to take a leak, and when you return, it’s black. 
That’s when it feels sudden. 
My excitement and joy for being Christian had long since set, and I wandered through my last bit of high school, and into Junior College in a bluish haze. 
 Then one day I turned around and it was pitch black.
I slouch into the classroom as the teacher starts to talk. 
I puddle into my chair, tossle my hair back out of place, and feel my energy drain like paint dripping down my face. 
I feel like a fraud. 
Flaunting something I obviously don’t have, didn’t know the reading, don’t know what’s due… I hide behind bad hygiene as a way to avoid a relationship. 
My insomnia and supposed craziness, just ways to delay obligation. 
And my ramblings. 
They do nothing. 
And all too much darkening. 
And the teacher drones on… “Harriet Beecher Mutha Fuckin Stowe, Ya’ll!” All I can do is curl forward and try to ignore this guy.
The margins of my notes… I don’t have notes. 
My notes are made up of doodle faces that gaze back with quirky grins, like they know something dark and morbidly hilarious. 
And I’ve drawn it so many times, it’s been driven deep into the rock wall of my mind. 
And now, I see face3s. 
Ones I’ve drawn before. 
When I close my eyes. 
In sloppy scribbling intensity. 
I seem to be trailing off again…   And suddenly it’s done. 
Books slap closed, zips and shuffles, and we all gush out the doors as one. 
I quickly find a spot off to the side to catch my breath with some tobacco burnings.
I find a tree near Sproul Plaza, on the lawn. 
A detatched spot to observe the motion. 
The movements of… Them. 
All those passing people who seem to know where they’re going. 
I crouch beneath my tree, light a grit, and scribble down some more meaningless shit…
“I chose this tree because it seemed like the right tree for me to crouch beneath and collect my thoughts as the cute blonde from class walks past.” And I squat there as she passes, holding my hangover before me as my reason for not speaking. 
Even though she lingers, glancing at me. 
And as she passes I notice her pants are staring at me. 
Especially the butt. 
-I refrain from approaching-
The key is to look busy. 
That’s why I doodle. 
And write. 
And play guitar. 
And pop my knuckles and chew my fingernails and find little toys to play with. 
Pebbles to make patterns. 
Sticks to draw in the dirt. 
Rocks to carve into each other. 
I’m occupied. 
Like a restroom. 
Or a seat on the bus. 
My attention is taken. 
Earn it. 
Why must I encroach? Come interrupt me. 
Or leave me be. 
Don’t just glance over expectantly.
I chose this tree because it called to me, and I needed a moment of peace. 
Creation. 
Distraction. 
At times the world comes at me in descriptive paragraphs and I need the elongated pause to recover from the onslaught of experience. 
I didn’t stop to watch the cute blonde from class walk past. 
She has a yellow headband and black silk pants. 
I quickly name her Marie, and decide that one day she’ll marry me. 
Yes, you’ll marry me, Sweet Marie… she wanders on, and everyone she passes pauses long enough to look busy. 
Ah yes, the curse of beauty. 
The common people are far too intrigued to approach thee, Sweet Marie. 
One day I’m sure you’ll talk to me, and I to thee, Sweet Marie…
Sweet Marie wanders on, and I’m left under my hallowed tree. 
Once she’s gone I’m at liberty to enjoy the actual scenery. 
Sproul Plaza is… Crawling and seething and flyering and screaming. 
And all beneath those silly fuckin trees. 
Invented right here on campus. 
I hate those fuckin trees. 
They’re an existential mockery of what we choose to do with our potential. 
Like absurdist chess pieces, or solders at a wedding, they line the wide path that is Sproul plaza, leading from Telegraph to Sather Gate, under which we find our hero, lying on his back. 
No, not me. 
I’m off to the side, under my hallowed tree. 
Our hero is…
Cyco. 
(pronounced Psy-Ko) Or, the upside down cycler. 
He’s doing his art routine. 
It’s hard to explain. 
He has a lot of props; an upside down bike, modified in such a way so that he can lay beneath it and peddle… an invisible rope which he climbs, hoping to get to heaven. 
He’s usually got jammies or a hospital gown on, to which he pins many little painted pieces of paper. 
He has ann umbrella, wildly painted. 
A blanket. 
A towel or two. 
He’s always in the midst of a nonsensical display of true art for art’s sake. 
Swimming in place, or the ritualistic crossing and uncrossing of sticks. 
Or just climbing his invisible rope. 
Pilot goggles. 
Always pilot goggles. 
Almost forgot about that. 
He wears ‘em so often you start to think they’re just his eyes. 
Everyone knows that. 
Don’t need to mention his pilot goggle eyes. 
It’s a given.
Today he’s lying on the ground, pawing at the sky, as if he’s swimming, except more floundering, or treading water. 
Maybe it’s the backfloat. 
He’s got his head under a towel, only his mouth is showing. 
An Asian girl pauses and bends towards him. 
His displaced mouth has a slight grin. 
The Asian girl is extremely perplexed. 
Worried too.
“Excuse me, sir?” She bends towards him, clutching her books to her chest like a bullet proof vest. 
“Sir? Do you need help?” He shakes his head slowly, and swims languidly on through the concrete. 
“Sir?” She obviously didn’t notice him shake his head. 
Or maybe she doesn’t trust his judgment. 
She seems absurd. 
A caring stone in the midst of the roaring flowing crowd. 
Even the cycler just smiles, and swims on through it.
She looks up and down the stream of people, looking for something to reassure her. 
A white passer by quickly fills her in; “He always does that. 
It’s his art. 
Don’t get too close, I hear he has rabies.” The Asian girl hurries on, not looking back and the young white guppie swims up the stream after her. 
For a moment he stops and glances back at the cycler, thinking to himself,
-I wonder what it feels like to be that guy. 
He seems pretty happy with himself. 
I wonder if he’s gonna go to heaven for being innocent or hell for being crazy-
Under my tree, I sit and watch, more caught by the people who interact with him, than by the actual hero. 
He’s alright. 
Some memorable lines. 
Once I was clipped by a passing bit of conversation he was spitting. 
A polite student, a nodder, was standing there nodding. 
I almost approached so as to take part in the exchange, but I thought better of it, and sat nearby, so as to overhear.
“The Future is very shakey…” He held his hands out, with the invisible world between them, and he shook it for dramatic effect. 
 “Because it doesn’t exist…” And he pet his invisible cat, and nodded, staring straight into the nodder’s eyes, who stood there nodding back, like a hypnotized pigeon.
I liked it so much I turned it into a poem. 
It’s called…
In Which the Upside-Down Cycler Confronts The Existential Crisis by Providing us with an Example of Action without Meaning, meanwhile paralleling this very action with the question of the Existence of Time
and it goes like this…
The Future is very Shakey,Because it Don’t exist…
Now the key to this piece is the dot dot dot at the end. 
The ampersand. 
Because the poem isn’t over. 
It’s still existing and being experienced, simply because it echoes in your skull cavern, and therefore it can’t end. 
The ampersands of time. 
Such are the days of our lives.
I think I’ve hit another brick wall.
While I’m dribbling out all this nonsense as a way to purge my severely hungover brain, two young black guys approach the upside down cycler. 
They get right up next to him, and point and laugh, enjoying the spectacle. 
It’s not in a degrading sort of way. 
Well, not really. 
The cycler doesn’t seem to mind. 
I hear them talk to him. 
Something like “Man, you fuckin crazy!” “Yeah, what the fuck!” One slaps a knee, and they both cackle. 
This response seems the most fitting. 
Yes. 
This man is hilarious. 
He’s not normal. 
He’s not a threat to himself or others. 
He’s just kinda fuckin hilarious.
And for half a second he represents everything. 
A moment of frantic action with no context, no meaning, no reason. 
He is the ever present essence of existence. 
Why are we here? Because what the fuck else are we gonna do? All action is meaningless without explanation. 
Meaining becomes clouded and lost in language. 
Excessive abstraction alienates the spectator, while a lack therof leaves the spectator swimming in concrete. 
What in God’s name am I saying? I… I can’t follow my own train of thought. 
I need to calm down. 
I need to stop watching this guy. 
Maybe his madness is catching…
I find a spot by the fountain. 
A spot to sit and space out. 
This fountain. 
Filled with bubbles, stupid college cliché. 
I guess everyone gets to do it once. 
Or what if the university does it ‘cause that’s how they clean it. 
Keep out the mold and shit. 
Stupid bubbles. 
The sound of the fountain slowly crushes all my thoughts, and I’m lost in white noise. 
My mind floats on a clear gray lake. 
Within the sound is a waterfall. 
A very specific waterfall. 
It drops from my mind into my chest. 
It’s the waterfall we used to jump from in Big Sur. 
It’s almost dry now. 
This jump is no longer safe, seeing as the landing spot is ankle deep now. 
Some shift in the rivers flow, a logjam up stream, a gush of silt and sand, filling up the gorge swimhole. 
But once and forever more in my mind, from the Big Sur cliffs we’d launch out and fall, thirty forty fifty feet down into the deep gorge waters.
-----------------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER 4  Big Sur, CA1998
Big Sur is a campground a couple hours south of Feugit. 
We’ve camped there every summer since I can remember with the same twenty or so families from the church, every year. 
We transplant almost the entire block. 
Several blocks. 
There were over 500 people in our church, and maybe 6000 people in Feugit. 
That means we were almost a tenth of the Feugit population. 
Wow. 
Never did that math before. 
Weird.
So we’re at Big Sur, with this church community extension. 
And it’s the network of campsites, so we have this huge stomping ground. 
Stop in at the Johnsons and try their blackened salmon. 
At the Patzke’s site they’re serving up fried crawdad. 
One year we caught a gopher snake, and Mister Scheopp killed and cooked it for us.
So it felt like we were still in Ben Lomond, like the walls and protective environment of community was still there. 
It musta been the summer between seventh and eighth grade. 
We were on break. 
And here, in the woods, a bunch of scrappy redneck kids, we were immortal. 
At night we’d still be subject to the minor requirements of our parents. 
“No more cigars! You already had one tonight!” … “No, you can’t go hiking. 
You’re just gonna go smoke cigars.” “What do you mean camp on the ridge?!! What do you think we got this campsite for?! No! No camping on the ridge, no night hiking, and no cigars!”
But two or three miles upriver, the silence of nature overwhelms, and even the thought of parental disappointment melts away under the crushing sound of water. 
We’re at the gorge. 
The only approval we need is from each other. 
I pull a backwood cigar and a lighter from their safe stowage of plastic baggy. 
Eli and JP approve. 
We light the cigar, lay back on the rock, and continue to do as little as possible.
The massive slab of obsidian has been soaking up heat since sunrise. 
Now, six hours later, our bodies sprawl out, soaking in the sun, baked by the stinging heat, leaving wet body prints on the rock when we shift, or get up to jump off the rock, ten feet down into the icy shock-water.
Most of the campsites in Big Sur are canopied by the looming redwoods. 
The sun leaking through makes birthmark light-splotches in the shady hall of nature.
There’s really not much to do at the campsite. 
The housewives talk. 
The kids scramble around, find sticks to use as scepters and rocks to use as rubies. 
Most make a voyage to the river at some point. 
Not a huge river. 
At some points you have to swim, at others you can dance across on rocks, from one shore to the other, like footprints on the floor for dance lessons.
The river is inhabited by crawdads, which we often catch and eat. 
I remember walking with my dad and getting bit by one for the first time. 
Just a warning snap from it’s cray pincers. 
“There’s something in the water! It Bit me!!” I hollered, crawling up my dad’s leg, trying to get out of the water. 
I was five at the time.
“Oh, it’s probably a baby crocodile.”
“There are crocodiles here?”
“Yup. 
Just watch out for the big ones.” My dad always liked to mess with our minds. 
I think maybe my problem is I’m still trying to sort through what’s real and what’s not. 
You know, banana slug goo will melt your hands off if you don’t wash it quick enough? And you have to wash it off with hot sauce. 
And if your hands start burning, that means they’re starting to melt, and you need more hot sauce before it’s too late…
As you hike further up the river away from the campsites, cliff faces rise up on either side. 
Massive boulders are strewn about causing dwarven waterfalls and liliputian bays. 
A couple miles upriver is the gorge. 
The gorge is just about the deepest point in the river. 
At least that I know of.After a wet winter, it can be over twenty feet deep, but it’s usually between ten and fifteen. 
It’s also the point where the river cuts right along the bottom of the cliff that follows the river at a distance. 
A log leans diagonally going twenty or thirty feet up this cliff. 
This is what substitutes as a stairwell. 
There are several ledges reachable from the log. 
A rope hangs from the tree. 
Level one is fifteen feet up. 
It’s where you grab the bottom of the rope and swing out, letting go before you swing back in and smoosh yourself. 
Level two is maybe twenty five feet up, and you have access to the rope, but most people just jump out. 
The rope hangs from the tree, which I guess is level three. 
I saw some kid hang from the tree and drop, but I jumped from level four, which is even higher. 
You have to jump over the tree. 
From up there the crags and cliff faces reach out towards your landing spot. 
For most, this is the only cliff. 
The one you can jump off of, and try to count, but you can’t get past two, ‘cause it’s “One one thousand, Two one thousa… Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuuuuuu…” Before you’re interrupted by the water enveloping you, leaving your heels bright red and electrically numb.
On a bad day you’ll get to the gorge and find naked hippies taking pictures of each other. 
On a fine day you’ll find it fairly deserted, almost reserved for you and your posse to horse around. 
On a good day, there will be grown ups and there will be beer. 
At least in their stomachs. 
And there will be rednecks having flashbacks to their teenage years. 
I can still see them, all drunk, open Coors in hand, scaling the cliff, reaching the top, and trying to muster a double gainer. 
A crowd spreads across the rocks, chanting “Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!” He inches towards the ledge, scans the crowds, catches every cute chick’s eye, takes a final chug, and finally pushes himself off into the air,
hurtling, it’s a half gainer… a little farther, it’s a full one… another half, almost there, but you can see he’s gonna land wrong. 
You wanna close your eyes, look away, but you watch as *SMACK* like a bird hitting a window. 
Any other landing besides feel first or diving, the sound is a thick raw slap. 
A hunk of liver on a marble floor. 
Watching him crawl out of the shallows, his torso pinker than his sunburned back… it makes your own torso tingle just under the skin, a flashback to misfired flips ending in similar fashion.
This particular year, I was, what, twelve? Thirteen? Anyways. 
We lay on this rock, basking and drying, leaving our wet spots. 
Every few minutes we’d crack an eyelid and watch a body hurtle downwards, usually accompanied by a loudly screamed profanity. 
Quality entertainment. 
This is the ritual. 
Fairly common, I suppose. 
To lay in the sun until all the energy is fried and sucked out of your bodies, than flopping off the rock into the river, the crisp freezing water. 
Soothes the burning body like nothing else. 
I was about to flop into the water like a dead burnt fish when JP jumped up.
“Who’s jumpin with me!?!” You could hear the frantic stretching edge in his voice, trying to sound hyped up, but unable to completely mask his terror. 
Yup, he meant the big cliff. 
I cracked an eye and looked at him.
JP was the fat kid. 
He wasn’t huge. 
And since then he’s turned it around and become a ball of testosterone soaked muscle. 
But back than at about one thirty, he pudged out like nothing standing next to us ninety pounders. 
He was the guy at the back of the pack when we ran. 
I was back there with him ‘cause I hated running. 
He was always at the bottom of the dog pile, which was perfect. 
Something soft to land on if your elbow drop victim dodges. 
He was always at the bottom of the tree when we climbed. 
Not the very bottom, but we never thought it safe for him to come all the way to the top where the trunk is as thick as your wrist and the branches are as thin as your fingers. 
Oh, and he was the nicest guy on the planet. 
Still is as far as I know. 
But he’d never outdone me. 
I could run faster, jump higher, dive deeper, and brag longer than he ever could. 
And now, here he is, standing up, about to hurl himself from the highest cliff in the universe, into the water, with full knowledge that I’m too scared to. 
What an asshole. 
I’m the outdoer. 
He’s the outdone. 
Well, now, that’s not true at all. 
But back than it was.
I watched in stupefied wonder as he and, who was it? Jeff maybe? Eli? Or maybe it was Rachel. 
Well, the two of them got up, and cheered at each other for a moment before heading off to scale the cliff. 
Strange urges to scale after them arose in me, but I wasn’t gonna give in to the mad whim for at least another year. 
I looked up at JP perched atop the cliff peeking over the edge, his eyes big and goggled. 
He stepped back and my heart slowed.
“Man,” I said to no one, “I knew he’d wimp out.” But then all at once, as if some pulley had snapped in his brain, he ran towards the edge and hurtled himself off. 
Iwatched his facial expression evolve with the fall. 
At first, while running towards, it was a set face of fierce determination. 
As his foot left the cliff, there was a glimpse of horror, a sudden realization of fact, and that expression quickly blossomed into a wailing scream. 
In several falling seconds, he disappeared into the water with a much smaller splash than expected, and popped up a few seconds later, sputtering yelling and laughing. 
I just stared at him, confused. 
Not understanding. 
Why had it worked for him? I’d been up there before, looking down, but I hadn’t …  why had it worked for him?
It was the next year when I finally took the jump. 
Or course there was a girl involved. 
A nameless background sort of girl. 
I’d hiked up there to find Eli, but there being a lack of Eli, I talked to cutie.
“What’s up.”
“Hey Mikey, wanna jump with me?”
“Huh, wha? … Yeah! Ok, of Course! No problem. 
You scared? I’m not.” While I stood there sputtering, she made her way off towards the cliff, and I was forced to follow before I could … really, decide to go along with it. 
Scaling the cliff was easy. 
I can climb. 
I’m good at keeping my grip in situations. 
Like, trees, and fences and stuff like that. 
But when you’re supposed to just kinda fling yourself out there? What the hell is that?! Maybe three or four minutes of scrambling up nearly vertical trail, and then a glance down from the top, and your brain zooms in and pulls back, and you gotta look up at the sky, ‘cause that’s always the same distance. 
Why is the ground…  so faaaaaar, so faaar dooowwwwwww … and there’s the water. 
The girl glanced back at me and giggled. 
The bitch giggled. 
And fuckin jumped. 
I stood up there, feeling totally mocked by that goddamn giggle. 
I stood up there, ten or fifteen minutes, contemplating my mortality. 
The gorge was packed. 
Catcalls, drunks hollering up, “”Jump!” Madness. 
I wanted to crawl back down the cliff, tail between my legs. 
I wanted to not have to do this ever, and not have to pretend like…
Quick! While I’m distracted, I gotta get my body to do it before my mind realizes! One, Two, Three steps, and Out!!!
Out I sailed. 
For one second. 
Two seconds. 
Still falling. 
How long does this take? I’m gonna have a heart attack! You feel just how fast you’re going, the wind whipping through you, until SPLOOSH! … it’s over. 
You bob and grin. 
You feel the blood in your veins. 
The sun is brighter. 
Your souls sting from impact. 
Your eyes glow with intensity…
-----------------------------
Fine precious stones ground from the wells of memory against the grindstone of language. 
We spit out finely shaped gastrulates. 
Palatable pieces slowly digesting, we feel them burning in our stomachs long after the final word has been whispered.
I picture my sex-leprechaun piece again. 
It’s still written on a bathroom stall, but this time it’s in a hip chain of coffee shops that I start with my amazing poetic genius. 
The coffee shop is called “Poetic Genius” and the sex-leprechaun story is written on all the bathroom stalls in all the Poetic Genius coffee shops across America, and gangsters and hipsters and street prophets and goobers rework it with their sharpies while they shit in my coffee house bathrooms, all across America. 
After all, this is America, isn’t it? I feel noble. 
Proud. 
A drum roll, a Hammond Organ, and a wailing woman vocalist.
I dig out my notebook and grab a pen. 
I find an empty page and stare at it. 
I keep staring at it. 
I feel the way a sea diver feels when he’s surrounded by iridescent jelly fish, but he’s brought the wrong fucking lens and all the pictures are sure to turn out like tie dye turds. 
Something invisible and fleeting, but not fully there. 
Something. 
This is all I can manage…
I get up from the fountain and wander off towards Shattuck, passing over the thick metal hatchway that leads to the steam tunnels. 
 I've heard about the steam tunnels from a friend of mine who went shrieking through with a tribe of boozed up youths. 
Open this hatch here, and you can make it into the library. 
See the flashlight flickering down there past the rows of dark dusty books? …  I never got to go. 
Perhaps one day, when I’m old and crazy, I’ll crawl down there and break into the library.
I wander off towards my house, through the dim yellow streets, but my thoughts are still crawling through the steam tunnels, haunted with mist up to your waist, echoing voices calling to each other, distant flashlights flickering…
----------------------------------
Chapter 5  cackleghaspingwickedbadsavage    Feugit 2005
Perhaps it’s pitch black in the steam tunnels. 
Perhaps they had to crawl along an inch at a time, the glowing face of their phones leading the way… I'll bet those sissies had their phones out like linus blankets, comforted by the screen's stifled glow... 
 I been there. 
Not the steam tunnels, not here, no. 
And not with no friggin cell phones. 
It was true darkness, the kind that leaks into your eyes and makes you feel every sound not just in your ears, but in your elbows and your chest.
The tunnel was just wide enough to touch both walls at once, the roof a similar distance, just barely within reach. 
This gave us comfort. 
Knowledge of our lightless realm. 
Mere proportions, but comforting nonetheless. 
The water was up to our knees now, and we’d been walking through the pitch black for so long, it felt natural. 
Benjamin Raymond yodeled with delight as his next step took him two inches deeper.
I’m not sure whose idea it was. 
When we hang out this kinda thing just occurs. 
We found the river flowing casually out of the tunnel down the beach to the ocean. 
We both just sat down, took our shoes and socks off, and wandered in. 
The walls were concrete, but the riverbed was loose rocks. 
“You still counting steps?”
“Aint much else to do in this darkness. 
I’m up to ninety six.”
“Makes sense. 
I’m at ninety two, and you’re about four steps ahead of me.”
“I thought I was behind you.”
“Guh… hick! Begaaah! Guh!” Benny ray started making sounds guttural and squawking. 
The echoing tunnel made it sound like there was a tribe of boojums around us, waiting to strike.
B-Ray is a dispenser. 
Whether it’s high pitched yodeling into a dumpster or one liners litered with lireary reference, “I dub thee narcissus oxymandias mariner…” He owns every moment he’s part of, and laughs spastically at the slightest provocation. 
He writes when he wants to, and I’ve never decided how I feel about that. 
He uses crazy crazy words. 
Laconically, pedantically, he spreads his sesquipidelian pontifications prodigiously and yet lackadaisically. 
He leaves quotes in and on my notebook. 
“This is the spoot rag for your divine beauty.” Scrawled across one of my janky little journals. 
You could call him the quintessential child of the ADD generation.
Brilliant Haikus. 
Short stories could use some work. 
Novel? Well, he’s like the manifesto go to guy. 
A manifesto for every situation. 
Historians write novels. 
He is the historian of the ever thriving experience of right the fuck now.
Vonnegut said it best: “... 
a roman candle of a man.” His personality, presence, and the shock of blonde hair tossling into the sky Taller than you or me, enthusiastic about nothing in particular, and every possible particular. 
He especially likes the strange little details ignored by you and eye.
A few days ago he sent me a text...
<< a nearly blind autistic man just befriended me by wanting to sell me headphones and a voice recorder for ten bucks. 
I didn't need them but wanted to support him, so I bought them. 
He's now telling me the instruments he plays and what his parents do. 
He wears a fanny pack and amazes me so>>
It took him two messages to send, but he knows how important permanizing is and takes the necessary steps. 
In for sentences he tells a story short strong and strange.
Six years ago, I lost my virginity at his birthday party. 
It was the third day of his party, because his birthday kinda permeates into the following days. 
It's not over 'til you're hung over. 
A bad rule for Olympiad drinkers.
“Hey Benny Ray, how long's it been dark?”
“I'd say since puburty. 
But that's just an estimate. 
No, let's see now. 
I'm at a hundred a twenty three, taking maybe a step every second and a half...”
“Hang on, hang on... 
that's... 
half of ... 
fifty, and twelve, and hun... 
Hundred and eighty five!”
“Yeah, it's been more like ten minutes. 
Bad estimates. 
Hundred and twenty nine... 
 wait! THERE!! OH MY GOD!!!!”
“I SEE IT!!! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!”
“Ehacka hacka hacka... 
It's the light! The light!!” We hooted, I heard little splashes as he danced around. 
No visuals at all, except a little smudgy pin prick of yellow that kept disappearing and replicating itself as after image...
Slowly, ever so... 
It became less black. 
A soft gray glowing around the yellow speck. 
To the left and the right still complete oblivion. 
The edges, the tiny mouth, the walls crawling towards us with illumination. 
Distant scrambled graffitti scrawl... 
to the left and right hints of texture now. 
Flecks of color. 
Perhaps these walls hidden from exposure hide the truly permanized art, hidden away from the sun and the eyes and the whitewash and disapproval. 
Or maybe it's just bat-shit.
Finally we emerged.
“A hundred and seventy eight steps. 
That's at least a hundred steps through the total pitch darkness in knee deep water.”
“and... 
why? Did we, do that?”
“Look at where we are!” We'd come out in a deep gully. 
A fallen but living oak tree reclined across, stretched out on a massive bed of brambles. 
We scrambled up onto the oak tree's horizontal trunk, ten feet above the water, surveying our new habitat. 
Primordial it was. 
Greenery teeming and keeping us pinned. 
Steeped in the natural innocence of things untouched by man. 
Even though we'd taken the concrete conduit, the river was completely overgrown further on. 
To continue we'd have been crawling upstream, our bellies in the water and brambles in our hair. 
The trunk, our living bench, stretched along creating a catwalk from one steep brambled hillside to the other. 
But no escape except the way we came.
So he shows up, once again, on his birthday, ready to remind me that it's all right to die a little bit sometimes. 
October second, he shares his birthday with Ghandi and Groucho. 
Such a duo of predecessors and you're bound to have your uniquenesses. 
He showed up on the second, and left on the sixth, catching his bus back to Feugit at seven in the AM. 
He got the jump on his hangover by waking up drunk, and meeting up with Tequila toting relatives, narrowly avoiding the headache that would symbolize for him the end of his birthday celebration.
That afternoon, when I finally woke, I sat on my stoop and watched a little Mexican girl run around the parking lot, grabbing all the loose newspaper and hugging it to her face like a teddy bear. 
I think I said that wrong, because when I saw it, I was appeased and cured. 
And she ran off and tucked it away somewhere, and came back for more. 
As she passed close to me, she looked at me sideways and said something in childish Spanish, the words were smeared in the wind like watercolors.
The best sound in the world is four year old Spanish,
especially when it comes from a sideways smile.
My door stays closed for the most part, as do my windows and face. 
But when Benny Ray blew through for his birthday, he opened everything up and placed himself in the doorway like some sort of hero, perched on the edge of experience. 
The day before he left we went through three and half twelve packs between us. 
I lay curled on the couch, beer number twenty something threatening to drop from my slackened grip. 
B-ray looking into the outside like an astronaut philosopher, wondering what he's about to do.
“It's dark.”
“Yeah B-Ray, it's night.”
“I didn't expect it to be dark when I woke up.”
“We passed out while the neighbors ate their early dinner. 
Of course you wake up at night.”
“Shut up, fucker! When you sleep you don't interact with time. 
So when you first wake up, time doesn't exist. 
It's just the morning of your mind.”
“the morning of your mind. 
I like that. 
You gonna write it down?”
“No.”[Soft Break]“Fucker.”
His eyes scanned the moonlit lot. 
Cars peppered the spaces. 
An extended Mexican family (blood or not I don't know) extended down the sidewalk of the complex. 
A large white woman struggled up the stairs on the left, squeezing past a pile of broken furniture.
“Michael, you live in a box of oddities.”
“you have no idea. 
I have a neighbor you've never met that will send your mind reeling. 
This guy... 
he made me start caring about myself again.”
“That's fucking huge! This guy must be amazing!”
“He's the only company I've had for awhile, and you're more than a relief. 
Even you would be hard pressed to appreciate... 
The Moth.”
“Why is he called the Moth?”
“He only comes and visits when he sees the kitchen light is on.”
“Ooooh! That's why you keep your kitchen dark! You're fuckin twisted.” I handed Ben a crumpled page, and he began to read...
THE MOTH POEM
Moths are Beautiful.
Moths are Blind.
Moths are Delicate, and nobody loves them.
“Is that it? That tells me nothing! What the fuck! What is this guy? It's all so intriguing.”
“Oh yes, I know. 
I'm toying with your emotions.
“So tell me about this creature of yours.”
“Well, he used to scare me. 
And now, I wish he still scared me. 
Because when you're scared of someone you don't fucking care. 
You don't think about the inside of their head. 
Sometimes I look at him slouched on my couch, and feel like maybe he's dead. 
His front teeth are still good. 
No, not good. 
There. 
His front teeth are there. 
They are gross, and the only ones he has left.”
“When you say Moth, do you mean Meth?”
“Dunno. 
He says crack and I don't know the difference. 
Seems to have the same outcome. 
Hollowed out bug eyed scratchy faced toothless tattooed friendless choking hacking laugh that seems to have something I don't. 
Maybe it's cause he's scorched out his skull and is left with this simplicity that baffles me. 
He's got this jawbone that juts out like a diving board, especially when he's been smoking crack. 
And that's when his lips go in and out of the crack pipe pucker.”
“Why are you telling me about this guy?”
“Because I feel obligated to. 
Because he exists dramatically and passively. 
Naturally and freakish. 
Cared for and incompetent. 
He is. 
He must be pointed at. 
I apologize to him for pointing, but the world needs to fucking know what happens and why. 
He's a biproduct of a flawed system. 
A symptom of national madness. 
A child of broken America.
“If I don't jot this shit down and impress upon others this guy's existence, he'll disappear without a trace. 
And the heavy dark truth that he embodies will go on unhindered.
“i know this isn't exactly a stellar moment of memory, but he's there, up on the second floor, and this here is proof of it. 
This stupid little poem. 
And he's got these horribly morbid haikus. 
Just shit he says in conversation. 
I write them down after he leaves. 
He thinks he's just talking, which he might be, but once I write it down, it's a morbid haiku.”
“Well let's hear one.”
“They're not normal haikus. 
5-7-5? Not so much.”
“Didn't really expect those standards to be met. 
Not coming from you.”
“Alright, this one's kinda fucked up...
I got a busted ear from my daddy.
He used to beat me up real bad,
But he's still my best friend.
“Oh, that's fucked.”
“Yeah, he's got a gnarly batch of backstories. 
Just his list of medications would make a poem. 
I'll have to try that later.”
“Let's hear another one.”
“Alright. 
This one int quite done, but it gets the point across...
Banana Now and Laters
Are Great
For when you're craving drugs.
“Alright Mikey, no more. 
It's all too real. 
He's taking images from my youth and tainting them with crack resin. 
So you gonna do a character study?”
“No, prolly just a collection of morbid haikus. 
He's hard to think about. 
Hurts my soul.”
“Yeah, I hear ya. 
I always had better luck with drunks. 
Like Rockin Mark.”
“Fuck yeah! Remember his theories on how the universe works?” We both took long slow sips of beer and started trading Rockin Mark one liners.
Rockin Mark is in the permanent collection. 
He's not on tour anymore. 
Last I heard he shaved his scraggle beard, cut his mangle gray hair and started goin to church. 
First time I saw him he was at the bus stop, tellin me about how girls wear nailpolish because it gets them high. 
He had a fat glob of it on the tip of his nose, all bright glittery green.
Through our late teens and early twenties we'd find him rocking out in the Ben Lomond Park or by the Covered Bridge or behind one of the churches. 
He lived in various places. 
There are a few horse pastures where we'd hike with our booze, and we'd sometimes find him perched on a fallen tree, jammin on guitar. 
He used to camp behind the gold dome church, but I guess they kicked him out. 
Heartless bastards. 
As if God was bothered.
Rockin Mark is always on. 
Sometimes he'd have a crazy crazy story to tell. 
His eyes all beady through his oversized glasses would slide around back and forth like goldfish filled with mercury.
“Look at my bandages. 
I set myself on fire the other day. 
It's a long story, let me explain.” It was a very long involved story. 
First, cleaning his pipe with rubbing alcohol, spilling the rubbing alcohol on his lap, and a little while later, sparking a pot pipe, and in the process the fumes and thus himself, two tall cans and a half gallon of grape juice to appease the flames, and finally when that failed, two kind hearted Indians on motorcycles, long hair flailing in the wind, noticing his condition and putting him out.
Sometimes he'd be in rock mode and jam on guitar, interspersing his riffs with little one liners...
“I don't wanna chop down any of these mountains, I love 'em!” He points to the sky with his middle finger. 
Not out of anarchist rebellion, but because he lost his pointer finger. 
Mighta been frostbite. 
I don't remember. 
But he'd also show his toes, or lack thereof, to the girls to make 'em shriek.
A battery powered amp, no bigger than a breadbox. 
A voice like the gravel he pees in every morning. 
“Don't wanna leave a puddle.” Clever guy. 
Completely bonkers. 
He sounds like his voice is coming from a sewer grating. 
He wears a ballcap with a strawhat perched on top. 
One flannel, one windbreaker, one leather, all worn and grunged and almost bonded together. 
He started telling us about how the universe works... 
“Lemme explain something to you beautiful people...” Than he listed names. 
“There was Buckminister Fuller, Nicole Tessler, and Einstein.” He glances down and begins examining his hands. 
A sloppy unfinished pentagram tattoo on the back of his left hand, a Dream catcher around his neck... 
“No, Lemme start over.” He continues. 
“It's like a giant game of tinker toys, except with extra balls, extra sticks, and probably beer money.” We were all the more enraptured, because he seemed completely sure of himself. 
He'd been thinking about this, and knew exactly what he was talking about. 
Fuck the rest of the world. 
They'll never catch on. 
It makes sense to him, and that's good enough. 
I still wonder about the tinker toys thing. 
Maybe that's the key to true understanding...
Prolly not though.
Rockin Mark is one of the many. 
He holds more beauty than most, and B-Ray is one of the few who can ... 
 ot quantify, but clarify, expose these things. 
Benny Ray showed me where to find the secrets; the details that save souls.
He talks to strangers. 
All friggin day long. 
When we ride the bus together, Benny Ray finds some stranger to approach. 
Interrogate. 
Encourage. 
Entertain. 
Interaction seems to justify itself.
That's why I dig it. 
'cause I'm terrified of strangers, and I get to watch him, totally unaware of the danger he's in. 
Strangers?!?! They have diseases! And sad stories they want to tell you! And confusing questions that you can't answer without offending someone! And than they'll leave you and you'll be alone and than it just gets darker and emptier and colder.
---------------------------------------------------
Chapter 6 VIRGINIA AVENUE Berkeley, 2009
It's dark and empty. 
Virginia Avenue is vacant. 
The wet asphalt gives the wind's edge a biting smack. 
It peels my eyes back like sardine lids. 
A bit of a back and forth drawl down the emptiness. 
There's a clarity I find right around midnight. 
Like I finally taste my breath for the first time in the day. 
My eyes don't scan the ground, avoiding possible contact. 
My hands don't fiddle and scratch, and my feet don't hurry homeward.
It's dark and empty. 
Everyone else is warm inside. 
This night, this is proof. 
Of what I'm not sure. 
Perhaps that this remembrance is due. 
This soft shrinking of skin seems to bring my insides closer to my surroundings somehow.
... 
I gotta quit smokin pot. 
My words are pounded out like stuttering mud bricks from a conveyor. 
I can't think right anymore. 
A little math, against a tree. 
Two forties, three bowls and a beer makes eighty twelve ounces and maybe a gram. 
Ninety two. 
I'm almost home. 
These are good numbers. 
Bad numbers that remind me that I must be in a good mood. 
The tally mark, the farcical score card. 
How much of you is left? The fraction of self still alive is inversely proportionate to the amount consumed tonite.
It's gonna be a long one. 
I'm home and it doesn't seem to be slowing. 
Rather it kicks into gear. 
Little planes doing dog fights behind my eyes. 
Whirring hum rumble, you know the tune. 
The human mind magma pulsating inside your face...
My bed sits in the corner, reminiscent of a funeral pyre. 
A mess of journals, piles torn and wrinkled lined paper skirting the edge of the bedpyre like kindling. 
I don't even sit on the bed. 
Inside the design, there's no way to see what you're part of. 
Instead I pull up a milk crate and start shuffling through the crumpled results of my most recent writing binge.
... 
It's Nonsense. 
 ... 
Dark and Miserable Nonsense...
I dig it out nonetheless and subject myself to its perusal.
----------------------------------------------
-MAGMA-2003
There's something in me. 
Some sort of frantic energy that needs to get out. 
Even as I'm typing, I stop and study my hands. 
That left pinky nail could be chewed down further without too much pain. 
I pop my knuckles and tap my fingers. 
I wriggle my toes as if I were somehow tied down. 
I always feel like it's time to leave. 
Or walk. 
Or just move. 
One room to the next and back to the first. 
What was I doing? Oh, just nervous pacing. 
Maybe my calmness is in the next room? Some sort of contentedness with my self and what I'm doing? Going from inert rut to stagnant air pocket, held down by my lack of gumption, yet tormented by this smoldering pocket of energy that keeps my sternum ablaze and chews at the walls of my brain. 
 Immobilized by lethargy while plagued by feelings of entropy. 
My thoughts grow stale and mold inside my head. 
How much have I wasted and forgotten? How much lies in the back closet waiting for me to take advantage, release myself on society? All I need to do is calm the Fuck down.
Well, that was a fun little piece. 
There seems to be this obsession with the self, personal potential, and the guilt that comes from burning it. 
The easy thing would be to label it a slow lifelong reaction to the dysfunctions found in Christian Fundamentalism. 
Maybe pair that up with a nice psychological breakdown stemming from the whole Xenophobe Infectious-Gentile mindset that this seems to grow from. 
I don't like this. 
I don't enjoy these things.
There was this stupid pun I wrote once about how I burned my chicken fingers on her stove. 
It's about how cowardice combined with ignorance results in the coward suddenly becoming aware of the strange burn - the ... 
the coward. 
Trying too hard, assuming some sort of optimistic fatalism...
What happened to my optimistic fatalism? I used to think I was doomed to succeed. 
Now I feel like I'm destined to not quite make it but come just right up to the edge. 
There must be some moment hidden in this paper streak, some moment where I start the piece as one person and end the piece as another.
-----------------------------------------------------
-Mine Mind-2007
my mind is mine... 
it's a fuck of a toy. 
Magical and pitiful,
Indquisitive and feotal. 
Paralyzed and hyperactive.
My forehead lines crawl along, skin ditches dug with morbid songs.
Like your face in the snow, a nosedive is all.
Like a smack from a brick with your lips.
And I fall into nowhere.
The dark unlit room comes along. 
The secret demon that rapes me
and tightens my jaw screws like ecstasy.
It does this a lot. 
Mine mind. 
You know into the sky, the snow.
And right when it's right? When I like it at night, it careens into caverns
With vulture beak logic. 
The dead and the edible.
Vulture beak, speak to me. 
Food killed by you is too good.
You prefer leftovers basted in mud.
You prefer bug eyed nail biting twitches.
The lost, the forgotten, the meaningless words.
The things that rattle out, the dark secrets told by sad little birds.
The logic that might make it into the novel. 
The logic that hates me.
The logic that creates my fantasy. 
What doesn't want to stop.
The engine running backwards, slowing my potential
The inability to be. 
To be me. 
To see what's sitting next to me
With the sweetest grin you'll ever see.
Why can't I look up from my mud stained shoes,
condemn my dark logic, abolish my blues.
Why can't I just look up and grin anymore?[Soft Break]Why does it all taste of sin more and more?
I let it slide in. 
My angry sad magic.
Potential for tragic, the part of me, that once was left behind.
Here it is, the me that I hate. 
The I forgot for so long.
The one that would run and take shelter in my shoes
Every time I saw you.
The half of me that hates sanity.
When first you approached, I held it back.
Suppressed my demon potential, curbed by sad tragic knack.
Now bound, we seem to be, I approach the parts that I don't want to see.
Displayed like a gypsy yard sale, I make your cheeks pale
with heavy faced morbidness, logic of doom.
I've dragged you into my darkened mind room. 
[Soft Break]Ybut you won't find the lights for me.
It's these parts I've never let you seem.
My darkness. 
Bad half. 
The part that should die.
Perhaps it's gone unapproached til tonite.
The part I never learned to control.
The big nasty cyst on the inside of my soul.
And I must expunge it before I can claim to fit.
I shit on your grins for letting stranger in.
These thoughts are not for you.
This is me letting it all fall away.
Face encrusted with self obsessed sadness mud.
Into the snow I go, to wash it away.
To let my face show.
Changing patterns.
Laughing under Chinese Lanterns...
Chinese lanterns? Fuck that piece. 
Some cheesy tacky “Take Me Back” Bullshit. 
I need balance. 
Where's the angry shit? Enough of this sorry sad mopey cheese...
-----------------------------------------------
-Modern Romance-2004
This guy is all about climbing up balconies and playing ballads on the lute, and preforming death defying feats to prove his love. 
He meets this chick. 
Starts to pursue her. 
She likes him at first, 'cause all girls respond to attention. 
I guess guys do too. 
But than she gets weirded out by his intense behavior. 
He keeps pursuing her, playing songs on her answering machine, writing her long love letters, leaving her flowers at work, in her mailbox, hurled over her fence... 
So finally she gets a restraining order against him. 
He may or may not have some dark back-story about criminal activity and her being part of some sort of sting operation without even knowing it. 
I haven't finished that part yet.
So he's at the bottom of her balcony playing his lute, and she comes to the window, yells at him for a second,and calls the cops. 
She tells him, but he keeps playing. 
He means to prove.
Four cop cars come screeching up, two from each direction. 
At the sound of the sirens, our hero glances around frantically, and begins scaling the lattice that leads up to her balcony. 
The cop cars all pull E-breakers, and smash into each other. 
The cops stumble out all shaken up. 
Some of them are bleeding. 
They look very disheveled and dizzy. 
Our hero hangs by one hand and spins around to get a view. 
He hoots and cheers with laughter. 
Does she cheer? Does she talk shit to him? She glances down, not feeling threatened, but a bit annoyed by him.
The cops shake off the crash and pull their guns, shouting in confused unison, “Freeze! Don't anybody ever move!!” Does he let out a maniacal cackle? They all start shooting. 
His arms hook into the lattice, and he goes limp, hanging there twenty feet up.
She starts screaming at the cops and swearing at them. 
They all guiltily slink away, and the scene is cleared as the camera holds the image of a large house dimply lit by the moon, a broken headlight, maybe a hub cap or a rim, and a body hanging from the lattice. 
And a girl a foot or two above him on the balcoy crying. 
There's a lute at the bottom of the lattice. 
It might be broken.
Not quite what I was looking for. 
Close. 
Closer than the last one. 
I dunno how I feel about this shit. 
It reeks of childish ... 
 ess.
------------------------------------
-Soft Shoe On An Empty Coffin-2007
Remember when I was “I”and you were “You”? And the only thing between us was “love”. 
We made a simple little three word family. 
It was beautiful. 
There was subject, action, and object. 
What more could we want? Just us eight letters, letting several spaces make each aspect an essential aspect of the whole. 
That was nice.
Something about three word sentences. 
They seem to reach into a seperate reality and pull out the intestines of our inner workings out with it, so that we may watch our various aspects preform. 
'it' 'was' 'nice' '.' An unspecified subject no longer is passively palletable. 
Who can argue with this? Who can relate to it?
The past. 
When I wasn't alone. 
When I slept next to a specific softness, when I smiled for no particular reason. 
. 
. 
 . 
 When was that? When was that?
When we could feel people looking at us, feel their thoughts. 
They're thinking “Aren't those two beautiful young people? They'll have a long beautiful life together.” Didn't that ever happen? Didn't we live and die together once? Or did I simply touch her nose? So gently making contact, didn't that happen once?
I once was “I” standing safely behind live. 
The love chased you to the end of the sentence. 
But who are we now? Who have we become? Like the silly picture books about the missing piece or the square peg stuck in the land of the round holes. 
Stuck in the land of mass transit bookworms and clogged cubby holes.
Living off memories of what once was, chewing on thoughts of you, like squeezing protien from a leather shoe. 
Chew it continually, beef jerky fiend. 
Foot flavored pain. 
You are meant to fake it. 
And don't take anything not prescribed. 
Live on – live on – live on – live in the dreams and thoughts and sun swept spots and shadow dancings above the window. 
Let the images and faces wander on through, past broken stained glass tear streaked cheek bones of a thousand forgotten things...
There once was a boy who loved a girl. 
She was crazy, like all girls. 
He was stupid and happy, like all boys. 
Until they meet girls. 
Once he met her, he streaked across the sky like an ightmare, bouncing between horizon lines, and she stood beneath, watching his rainbow streaks of joy shower down on her. 
And they laughed and danced for years and years and years. 
They pranced and lollygagged, wallowed in each others effervescence. 
They went to funerals and held hands, watching the bodies lowered into the deep. 
They didn't know the dead. 
They simply enjoyed the spectacle. 
As if it helped them know something more. 
And they ran off when the burying was done. 
They took turns spitting at the sun. 
They never made it, but just as well, because who knows what might happen had the sun been strick with their spit, infected with intimace...
The sund oes not know these things. 
A was of juicy goo, made from the mouths of youthful two. 
The sun only heats. 
Only watches and thinks. 
And its thoughts are as follows...
“I am very glad that I am alone.”
The lovers would glide away from the rays of the sun, hiding until the moon came out to join them. 
The morose ball of dead rock that hurtles and ponders on all the wonderful things it would be if someone would join her. 
The moons thoughts are as follows...
“Woe is me that my skin is harsh and grey. 
That these wandering people never stop to gaze into my face. 
They look upon me as upon a dead sun, prolonging their gaze to wonder about what made me ever burn out. 
It was eyes. 
Eyes like think. 
Eyes that look too deep and find something barren and graceless beneath. 
Why would you let my fire die? Why would you choose to view the inner workings, thereby sapping the beauty, when I could be so externally beautiful? So powerfully charged and truthful? Why would you let my fire die?”
...
I guess you start every piece as one person and end it as another. 
You are the alpha and the omega. 
The beginning and the end. 
Any character who believes in you will not perish but will have everlasting life on the shelf to the right of my family picture...
I don't have a family picture. 
I've left so as to miss them. 
And I do. 
Every day. 
But I don't have a family picture. 
Self inflicted exile.
---------------------------------------------------
MADE A LADY HATE ME
I made a friend hate me today.
A pretty lady.
I told her not to visit, because I can't take it.
And she flipped.
And All I can look at right now is the key that says ctrl.
control.
and alt.
alternative.
shift.
enter.
period.
Home.
End.
Pause/break, delete and escape...
I'm sorry I'm not miserable over you any more.
I'm sorry I can't dance in the piss mud of excess.
In the dreary gloom of just-us.
I fear justice. 
I fear
what I've done and who I've become.
I fear what I crave
and where I've awoken
I'm sorry.
You were beautiful once.
Perhaps you still are.
You took me places, or maybe I was driving.
We went there. 
We found that. 
We saw those things and felt it all through our electiric spines.
And alot of people died in alot of ways.
And alot of confusion still leaks through people into their homes and across their faces and
It's not contempt. 
It's fear.
Fear of who you are and where you're going, and whether I want to watch.
Am I allowed to walk>?
Am I allowed to hitch hike out of your life and find something I can handle?
Why can't I just be that long haired bastard in the sandals?
Why can't I jjust accept your hatred and shrug it off and let it go and move on and wake up tomorrow?
I keep waking up yesterday.
I keep waking up into places I haven't been and don't belong.
Why can't I talk?
Talk to strangers.
Beautiful happy intriguing strangers who want to tell me where they came from?
Why can't I call ? Or write?
Why are there so many faces that cylcle through?
Gypsy eyes and ojos and tanktop and Ruski, and Amy doesn't have a nickname, but she's visinting Berkeley in a week.
A girl called me weak. 
Yesterday.
Funny. 
It took every ounce of effort in me to tell her not to come. 
I can't believe I told her.
Sweetness. 
Goddamn. 
fuck sweetness.
Well that's done. 
I've dropped that vase several times, but ...
I've a weak mind. 
Too much horsepower. 
Not enough stability.
I'm not so delicate these days, buti find that amazing, appealing,
I feel like Mikey.
For the first time in a century.
And Mikey is tired.
----------------------------
SONG
Your eyes are not like tropical oceans reflecting a sunset. 
Nor are they eyes of tired exploding suns. 
They shall not be referred to as "sapphire shining" or "the well my soul flounder in." Your eyes are not the spot I crawl inside when I cry. 
Nor are they windows into the sky. 
Any and all references to your eyes are hereby reduced to the formal, "blue" or the semi-formal, "nice."
strict adherence to these aforementioned items, while not being mandatory or enforced, is highly encouraged, and will be rewarded with a comfortable distance from the emotions that the we of the world remain oh so baffled by. 
In the event that the author becomes half-assed in his strictly platonic approach, the proper authorities will be notified, and the author will be exposed to unpleasant stimuli in order to deter him from repeating any behavior that might cause his eyes to become "starry" or "Bright" or any other unrealistic adjective meant to cause shimmering and quivering. 
There shall be no shimmering and quivering. 
There shall be no references to limpid pools, nor the sun, oceans or sky. 
I have very little poetry these days. 
I have no romantic notions or optimistic shimmer. 
I have no concept of poetics. 
No rumbling diatribe hiding behind my eyes. 
My eyes are as dead and passive as they seem. 
I have a hard time talking when you're around because I don't actually think about emotions any more. 
Let me show to you the extent of my emotional capabilities: 
"Music is pleasing. 
Work is not. 
Booze and pot are nice. 
Sleep is the best."
I'm not sure what happened. 
I guess I may have closed off.
-----------------------------------
It's this rambling sort of wander through your day, finding specifics that really capture something. 
Anything. 
Like how the upside down cycler seems to embody everything for a second. 
There are little details throughout the day that do that to you. 
But they're secret details saved special for you. 
And if the main goal is simply moving between these magic details, than plot is totally unnecisarry. 
Plot, in fact, gives an unrealistic illusion of movement and destination. 
What I'm saying is you really ought to (I've started saying ought to. 
Not oughta. 
ought to) you really ought to start doing daily journal entries. 
Especially now
STIFLED RELEASE
Some mornings I wake up and I can't poop.
I live a tortured and godless life.
My decisions, my string of choices,
he recurring pattern that I slowly shape with my daily movements...
They lack God, because they are mine.
They are God, because they are intention.
They lack love because I choose things according to the weather in my tiny snowglobe. 
They are love, because it is an individual trying to align with the universe.
I left the valley and the church so that I could be guided by my own experience, my own logic, my own universe. 
No, not my own, rather the real universe. 
The one that continues on with out any of us, without our ideals or our assumptions or our faiths and lacks thereof.
I left the tiny little snowglobe of the valley and I've taken a hiatus from the church because I learned all the lines, and I rehearsed all the prayers and I knew how to respond to someone who was "Wrong". 
I knew how to show people they were "wrong".
And than I realized I didn't know shit. 
And I suddenly exhaled a mighty breath and looked around, and saw all these beautiful crazy people moving in beautiful crazy ways. 
And I decided to hate language, because it grasps deseprately at intention. 
Tries constantly and absurdly to put a collar on this exploding chaotic universe. 
To build glass walls of "The Way Things Are" and "Proper" bullshit.
We have choice. 
Very small daily choice. 
I don't choose whether or not to put sugar in my coffee. 
I need coffee, and I can't drink it black. 
I need sugar. 
BUT! I choose how much sugar, and with discipline and a network of supporters, I can slowly teach myself to wean off the sugar.
The real problem, though, is not pooping.
I can't afford healthy food, so I get constipated. 
This is all a self reflexive metaphor for graduating from Cal in English still lacking the capacity to "Get off the shitter" as it were.
sadly, there is no rehabilitation for the boring people in life. 
Come with me, to California, where beautiful foriegn women dance in the trees and throw down canned cocktails. 
Come with me to the center of the circle, and look around at the screaming lovelies.
GOD made this. 
He made me write this too.
I think he may have been drinking at the time.
Not me though. 
stone cold sober as a nun.
Well, a little stoned. 
But I am a mere leaf being blown along by the winds of this world, pausing long enough aloft above a bonfire, letting it tickle and singe my veins.
YOu know, maybe people are DIFFERENT!!!!
Some are twigs and some are branches.
Holding standing, firm pure and permenant,
or drifting, flittering, through God's sky, and into his mouth.
no body cares because the weather doesn't change in the snowglobe. 
Until the lord brings down a rain of fiber and hail, and we know that we have unstopped the floodgates of hatred and pain that have been building leagues and centuries behind us, rising, rising now to consume us and all we've created. 
All the toppling towers of humanity's masturbatory greatness, ready to crumble into the self righteous shit pile of realizing that the other half of the world is smelling and stepping in your shit. 
And they're sick, because shit makes people sick. 
And poor people have to live next to the shit tanks and thrive on the fumes of the ignorance of those who have never known hunger except as a social game.
------------------------------------------------
NOTE TO SELF
The truth of the matter is at the very smallest aspect of matter, and so on, and so on.
The glass ceiling is made of toys. 
Items and ownerships, envy and classism. 
As a collective society, to shrug this off like Atlas is impossible at this time. 
America is the rare place where we just may try something that's never worked before. 
We just may. 
But not until we have to. 
Establish that time line, predict that moment of shift, and stand at the opposite end of the tilting table, plate poised to catch. 
We exist in the ruins of our failed projects, or abandoned dreams. 
A shroud of satelites surrounds our heads. 
The broken dreams and failed attempts of our ancestors weighs down on us. 
Makes us forget.
WHIM IN THE NIGHT
all your ideas come in the night
all your thoughts come with darkness.
In funny shaped foriegn automobiles with plates that don't make sense.
Either nine characters long or four characyters shourt.
And when you close your eyes the shapes don't come, and your body is relaxerd, but the buzzing won't stop.
One thought comes: A man who wakes every morning, and runs outside joyous as all hell.
"It's happening again!! It's happening again!! "
Shut up Johnny.
But it's rising!! THe sun is back! It went all the way round and returned!
Yeah, Johnny. 
i know. 
(I would feel much smarter than him, but he's much happier, and if being smart means you aint happy, it aint all that smart)
Look at it man! Just look at it!
It's beautiful Johnny.
And I'll roll another cigarette
just 'cause the sun aint up yet.
Don't worry, sun. 
I'm keepin an eyeon everything.
and its good to know that cigarettees still glow, even as late as four in the morn.
It comforts me. 
The smoke.
At lesast it's still awake, idling drifting and swirling through the empty room.
I laid on my back and made my whole body relax, one piece at a time.
I laid on my side, but couldn't turn of my mind.
I sat up and started typing,
I thought about how perfect this is.
Not perfect. 
But exactly precise and ... 
perfect.
Five in the morn. 
Other people's easter. 
Someone elses monday. 
Somebodys morning. 
Right now.
And if I for one second think I've got it bad or rough or wrong, than fuck me.
Fuck me and every overpriveliged ...
fuck me.
THere's clicking in the bathroom and whirring in the kitchen.
several guitars spotted around the room, shillouetted by the light from the laptop screen.
And my fingernails can always be shorter. 
My nights can always lasty longer.
My cigarettes thicker, my drinks stronger.
My convictions more sensible
my goals more true
my thought s more cohesive my words more fitting my face more polished and shaved.
My teeth brushed, my hair cut my clothes cleaned my my my
nothing. 
Nothin.
I love my jalopy, but love means abuse.
Abuse means proper use, and you don't seem to understand what I mean.
my body does what I will it to. 
There are things more important. 
More pressing. 
More intriguing. 
Less depressing.
ACCIDENTAL GRADUATE
I graduated accidentally, because my rambling just happened to coincide with what the major required of me. 
What my degree got me was the ability to aim my ramble towards what my audience might be hoping to hear. 
This is how I accidentally became a cook, a local news reporter for a town I had never been to, and now property manager for a half house half squat. 
It's all just a rambling bluff, half hoping my words might click a switch somewhere and unlock the large stone door.
So my degree has taught me to dismantle all aspects of reality until society is nothing more than a game of interdependent grinning, and my voice is nothing more than the sum total pendulum swing back from my father's view towards my grandfather's, but on a different plane, towards a twelve piece cycle circling around and dripping down your spine. 
God, what am I talking about? What my English degree has got me. 
Well, the ability to sound deep. 
The pomposity to write as if I'm talking to you, the whim of ambient ramblistic tappings into subconscious apophenic patterns, but really it's all just flashing lights. 
I feel like my writing was retrospective childhood memoir in junior college, psychadelic rule breaking chaotic word game dance face trembles through Cal, and now it's become a mixture of psychadelic retrospect and rambley business plans. 
As of late my creative goals have become oriented around triggering the act of creation in others. 
Since the central goal is to prompt the act of expression, the central technique should be very detached from intellectualization and closer to the immediate and measurable experience of reality. 
If this is the central goal and purpose than simply the act ought to suffice, self justify, and such and so on. 
In this vein I've forced myself to become detatched from the concept of a complete and cohesive project, dedicating my efforts to getting lost in the detail.
But sludging through this stream of quagulated phlegm, pushing against a stream of lights launching out of the screen, pushing eyes deeper in, pulling attention further out, further further away from the self aware origins of mind and self. 
----------------------------------
COMING OF AGE NOVELLA
I feel like I'm not alive yet. 
Like if I get this book thing done with, get this fucking piece of shit out of the way, I'll be on my way. 
You're writing a book? What's it about? I dunno. 
Everything. 
Whatever. 
Fuck you, don't read it. 
It's just a book. 
Seven years is stupid, especially when I don't even know what the fuck I'm writing about. 
I can just see the genre marker now, "Coming of Age Novellas" Fuck You!! I guess I shouldn't resist it though. 
I just came of age. 
Why the fuck not? And in America no less. 
I had to make it up as I went along. 
So the book is done now. 
At least I assume it is, otherwise this intro is a bit premature. 
I suppose the whole endeavor was premature, trying to write before any sort of reason to write was there. 
I guess I still don't have a reason to write. 
The only reason I'm writing right now is to justify or explain all that messy writing that went on before this. 
I suppose I'm just laying my trail.
We used to blaze trails in the woods by our childhood house. 
Me and my brothers would take machetes and shovels and hatchets and find a shortcut that hadn't been found yet, up some preposterous slope, turning up poison oak for us to itch at, and tunneling into some scotch broom to hack at. 
The trail would always lead up to a massive tree stump shaped vaguely like a castle. 
On some occasions we built the castle out, forming decks with fallen logs and camouflage with fallen branches. 
That has nothing to do with anything, but the thought of it seemed so relevant and vivid, it had to be mentioned. 
----------------------
LESS AND LESS
I feel very little.
I feel less and less.
Life laughs as it passes and I can't help but feel I'm being tested.
The universe warps and flexes and giggles when I break.
Is it diet? Am I trying too hard? Am I a series of horrible mistakes?
he water is cloudy, there's shit in the sink. 
My stomach is howling about corn dogs and energy drinks.
I slump deeper, my slouching seems to scream. 
I'm tired. 
I'm broken. 
I've forgotten how to sing. 
It's nothing specific. 
Just a vague overwhelming sickness. 
I don't hate or cry or cut myself. 
I haven't quit or given up, in fact I feel I'm doing quite well. 
By my cheek skin sags and my eyes they droop. 
There are clouds in the water, and there's shit in the sink.
Well, I roll off the chair and onto the floor. 
My drink spills out at the threshold, by the door. 
Can I sleep it off? Is that close enough to death? 
I'm done with this goddamn in between chapter. 
I need to know what's next.
slumped and blasted. 
Pound another energy drink so I can crash again. 
So I'll be sure these aren't my thoughts and I can just shrug them off. 
curled up and crazy. 
I keep moving and slipping because I'm so fucking lazy. 
As long as I'm tired, something must have been done. 
As long as I can't identify it as mine, this shit storm. 
This goddamn stupid fucking shit storm brain. 
DIE BRAIN DIE! I'll fill you with chemicals that keep you running laps. 
my conscious mind laughs as the rest of me falls into turmoil, exhausted and lost. 
I'm still me and I've defeated myself. 
I win. 
I am subdued. 
Monastics fast so as to discipline the body. 
To develop control. 
So they can go into the world and give and give except those stupid fuckers never leave. 
Their ideal of bringing truth and joy to the world has been flipped around, and now they've locked themselves in. 
They starve themselves as masochistic punishment for taking part in the joys of the flesh. 
The joys of the flesh. 
Fuck this vein. 
This nasty depressing condemnation of saints. 
This excuse to masturbate and claim it's God's glorious hand powered joy-machine. 
This excuse to judge and accuse and demonize. 
Smirking, I look at the screen. 
I imagine it a mirror, these words are my face. 
It looks tired. 
One eye is wide, the other droopy and dry. 
It looks like I've been trying. 
But really, I don't fucking know .
I resent and condemn all that holds me back from my ramble. 
I tout my glorious shit filled mouth and parade about like a dog chewing on a dead mouse. 
As things bounce back and the flow changes, as it subsides, my energy dies, my words trickle off, and I'm still eternally pissed that I need this release. 
This diuretic issuance of noise. 
Is it pleasant? Fuck if I know. 
I'm just trying to clear the dusty cloud water shit pile brain spill that stains my teeth with yellow memories and greenish brown predictions. 
Soon, water will fall from the clouds, and wash this shit down the ocean sink.
THE MED
We identify ourselves in relation to our surroundings. 
I'm on a bench twelve feet from a redwood tree on the corner of Dwight and Hillside. 
A passerby just honked their nose. 
Aside from there there's birds and wind in the trees, recurring bicycle bells, seemingly meaningless ringing, as if the bikers are ringing for the steepness of the hill. 
But we love the steepness. 
Life suddenly violently all at once. 
We sat on this bench three years ago reading poetry and drinking steel reserve after closing the Med kitchen. 
We sad on this bench two years ago reading "When Now, the Med Eulogy." 
We sat on this bench last year and rehashed plans for Med the Musical. 
Now i'm here alone pretending to be waiting, pretending to be busy, busy with tapping back into various ways I am and have been here. 
When/Now is the crucial closing remarks written a month before I quit the Med, and thank God that glorious story will never be told. 
Well, perhaps. 
But first the closing notes that preclude my absurd exodus.
RAGGEDY REMINISCENCE
Straight to the fist clenching imagery. 
Past the hesitant abstractions into what actually is. 
Straight to the fist clenching imagery. 
The history. 
The plans for glorious faulty repetitions. 
Insistent desperate repititions. 
Incessant despairing repitititions.
The unstoppable rolling
out of new ways to prove that
we are what we've always been.
small partial grove of redwoods in a park,
Not much doin. 
Not much to do. 
But we are busy with the same old mess. 
Raggedy grunge reminiscent of what once was.
What once was powerful, tasteful, and true. 
I'm sure it's still here, somewhere.
In the heart of the bubble
he mind of the pimple
he face of every child who laughs, and than cries as Spider the drunk laughs by..
ying his flag to the iron fence, a hungry unkempt teenager, decorates, displaying his symbolic linens.
some reminiscent memory of flowers in gun barrels. 
not what you thought it was. 
Gumbo. 
Murky stew of human essence,
steeped in lackadaisical loiter lot grow onward upward into abstract absurdities.
waiting for someone to remind us why we ought to care.
we've always been here, in the park, under the trees. 
How soon will it not be enough to simply make due?
Something happened loud and long ago, long and loud ago. 
We came here to hear echoes. 
To see if the scraps might hold some sign. 
THe branches will always break off in the wind and shed leafy tears multiple times a year,
he twiggy stick fingers will never know home except to fall and be ground into edible soil again,
reconsumed by Godless trunk. 
To leave, to pursue the sky, this is the work of branches. 
The work of children and heady drifty seeker dancers. 
Does the wind ever catch properly? 
Are we ever propelled into weightless transcendence, or merely head change transience? 
Some passer bys point up, past the spreading arms of the tree, and say "See that drifter? Not a care in the world. 
No family, no home. 
No feet on the ground." some passer bys get the point, and smile. 
the wind is doing its job as is the leaf and the sky and the tree. 
Some people see. 
Pursuit of silence and noise. 
Of patterns and chaos. 
Of mine self and of losing that cursed reference point. 
Of losing the point. 
Glory in the lack of grimacing factoids that parade in front of me like mice into the oven. 
To cook and burn and be forgotten once again,
he last molecule propelled upward, into the sky,
past stretching branch arms,
past dancing wind leaves,
and truly once more into nothing. 
To burn. 
To be forgotten. 
To be and to not to be. 
This tortured social logic. 
To bend the box to fuck the box to laugh at the walls and stick your arm through,
for there is nothing there. 
This is what we pursue. 
In this cave of ours. 
In this cave. 
The truth of the lack thereof. 
The knowledge of absence. 
holding in your hand a partial thought of something that once was. 
A tree perhaps. 
shurunken realms. 
Incomplete knowledge base. 
Faulty logic in flawed assumptions. 
Patterns. 
broken breaking exploding patterns. 
Shatter patterns through geneologies across crowds. 
Into hearts and onto maps, expanding like raind drop fractals, rippling outward. 
The disinformation spreads.
boundless experiments and tumultuous phrasings,
our paradigms of language folding in backwards and mirroring something that was already upside down...
Our words are spiraling out of control now, no longer relaying meaning,
except as abstract replications of brains that can hardly cope with sentence phrase thought stalling stop before the wall before the alter before your children learn what kind of a monster you are.
----------------------
ECHOES
Something happened loud and long ago. 
Its echo reverberates to this day, which is why I say fuck this place. 
Saturated in conflicting layers, this place remains in chaotic stagnation. 
The vacationers are harassed by the locals who don't like how the old people run this pace. 
The students, the transients, experience this place as a stop off, a rest on the way to greater things. 
I suppose I really do want to leave this place, where all my thoughts and efforts are caught up in everyone else's unplannable pattern repitition.
Experiencing a plot seems more central than relaying the various occurences that brought it about.Not stopping to explain why subject matter changed, just hanging in space waiting in faith for the wheel to come round again. 
Camped on the edge of a concept I stutter out half thoughts and struggle against the onslaught of distractions, but it's too late.
Pheromone saturated sidewalk. 
Don't gawk. 
Along she comes, pausing to check if I'm watching.
Wrong. 
She's checking for cars. 
Stop looking.
I fall through visions emenating from her cheek,
left meek and bashful by the shape of her eye.
Try to grin. 
Did it send the message? 
She's checking for cars again.
She's got that skirt fuck bra strap look,
She leaves me screaming obscenities.
The conflicting friction of the call to be socially competent and present while being sucked aside by these subtle hints of decadence. 
The headspace it takes to maintain this strange form of social grace is the manifestation of intensely bad taste, and yet I will not look away.
-------------------------------------
THE FUTILITY OF SELF EXPRESSING SELF
For the first time in my life today, I sat down on the curb outside of Moe's books and looked at Caffe Med. 
It looks like corrugated tin and washed out circus colors. 
It looks like foggy shoddy murk town slurp in and keep it down. 
Something triumphant and homey, a return. 
It's been waiting. 
for years perhaps, standing in unison with two distinct spirits. 
The ancient original tradition home stance embodied in the geriatric regulars, and the dazed movin through outside crowd loungin lazy, always leavin and being replaced, just spangin my way on out crowd...
I've always been overwhelmed by crowds and strangers. 
What they might expect of me, what the proper social dance move is for the situation, whether I'm supposed to look happy or interested or non chalant. 
This sort of apprehension is magnified when cooking for strangers. 
Do vegans want oil or butter? Why? If not, How not, and When? What's the proper substitute for egg yolk when making a vegetarian ... 
Make it Martin style, but Martin before the war. 
After the war his culinary taste went to shit.
But at the Med, I don't really have the social anxiety that my upper class privileges have allowed me to develop. 
Rather I feel myself sink into the scenery. 
I become a rock or a clump of moss, or one of Julia Vanguard's poems.
Perhaps the best way to approach the Med is by treating it as if it were a human, and you were exporing it's organs. 
I might consider the grill to be the spleen. 
the bread fridge the apendix, the bar would be the neckline, and the and the piles of trash out back would be all that junk in the trunk. 
This task of giving the Med human characteristics is beyond my capacity. 
I am plain and simply to lazy and selfish to talk about something besides me for that long. 
So instead, I will develop a plan, so that in 10 years, if I come back to this and read it, I'll know what I was trying to do, instead of having some highly complicated in depth meaningful paragraph. 
so anyways, Perhaps we shall call Chapter One; The Med's Face. 
Now, we start on the curb in front of Moe's books lookin at the Med. 
You know, with the corrugated tin and the washed out circus colors. 
And the girls jump roping, in the picture by the stairs. 
This will be the first aspect of the Med having a face. 
By showing the picture by the stairs in parallel with the initial exterior shot, we will be showing its age character and charm. 
The Caffe Med as a little girl, surrounded by little girls jump roping. 
I can almost hear the Med talking. 
but not quite. 
'cause that's just too fuckin goofy. 
I hear the Med purr. 
When I go there and ignore everybody, like most days. 
I mean, I don't ignore everybody, but... 
I dunno. 
Once again, I feel like the scenery. 
Does the bannister care whether or not you hold it as you go up and down the stairs? Does the piano care if its face is locked so that no customers can play with it? Not really. 
It's a sort of passive acceptance of anything and everything. 
No, not what I meant. 
It's like, uh, unabashed willingness to do everything or nothing. 
everything and/or nothing.
Maybe that's what I'll call my book.
The third face would of course be the literal face of whoever is working behind the front counter. 
This presents the opportunity of juxtaposing Rojelio, the stern moustacheod barrista with Rusty, who shows signs of having studied under Saint Bob Ross. 
This juxtaposition of the two barristas will give us the chance to truly see the realism and beauty at work behind Caffe Med. 
No, that's it. 
I'm done. 
Lost it. 
What was it? Something to do with how people are who they are because they can't help
it, and... 
or maybe it was, you are nothing more than the decisions you make?
No...
No, it was how when you walk in to the room ,and there's a dozen conversations, and you ignore all of them ,and it becomes a sort of purring in the background. 
And the room begins to almost breathe together.
Curl up with a crowd
On the black and white cracked tile floor.
Feel the room shift its breathing.
You enter the room.
And you pause. 
Than join in and step on
To the black and white cracked tile floor.
But, I'm short, And it's gone. 
I was Just there right ow.
Up the Street, Down and out,
It's all Fuck! Can't be found!
Now I'm Done.
I slide in
To hide
Under this wonderous electric hum. 
And I breath with the room
And look down
At the black and white cracked tile floor.
----------------------------------------
SPIDER PIE 
He paused next to a clean looking Porsche Carrera. 
From my angle it looked as if he were talking to the car...
"Well aren't you a shiny fuckin grey piece of shit! I'll bet you open your shit up and fuckin scream up and down that goddamn fuckin piece a shit freeway! Goddammit Break your fuckin teeth your mom was a whore!"
The register he speaks in is a bit of a collection of everything offensive. 
Lend him your ear, friendly roman, and hear how he has been in a fight with practically anyone in this town who can throw a punch.
"I went to a party..."
"Why the fuck were you at a party?"
"I dunno. 
I jes' wen' in."
"And they beat you merciless?"
"Woke up in a puddle of my own blood."
"So why the hell did you go?"
"I didn't want nothin. 
Not their women, not their booze..."
"Eh? Eh??"
"Yeah, their booze. 
So what?"
And those 2 words hit the table like snake eyes, ending the game. 
So the Fuck What?
The timeless battle cry
Of the lost and left behind.
So is he goin to hell? Is he in hell? Or is he lovin every minute of it? When he peeled his face off the sidewalk, oozing blood from his mouth, we all know his first word was "Fuck!"
A very specific "Fuck" with volumes of meaning behind it. 
In that one blood puddle moment, with that one simple word...
What follows is an in depth look at what he meant to say when he said "Fuck." This is what he meant to say...
"And once again I have allowed myself to encourage my dark patterns of abuse. 
These college party boys have taken on the authoritative role of bashing, laughing and leaving. 
The only pattern I've ever known. 
Given to me by... 
you'll never know. 
I wear these patterns like a medal. 
The flinch that craves the fist.
I pull my broken face
Up from the sidewalk, and see my red red essence leaking.
I feel myself shrink.
And than rage. 
I pulsate.
And I shuffle off, cradling my raggedy shitlocks, hating life. 
Hating the history that led up to me becoming this thing.
And so I rage. 
Rage against my life, the endless fight. 
I feel accomplished waking up here
In the aftermath of getting smashed on.
My injuries prove that I got to them. 
I startled and shook their tidy little closed off world.
----------------------------------------------------
MAKE A LETCHER
Incapable of finding a truly personal story, we find roles to fill, old games to play.
And even this game that I'm at now has been thrown about inside me for seven years now.
So this now is only what was than, and now will be found within what I write next.
But soon I'm distracted as such a fine specimen of the sensual gender passes by,
And I'm caught in the thought of what should I say.
I'm terrified of beautiful women, so talking to you is like skydiving. 
Or some such thing.
But sitting here is simply the soft and passing essence of possibility.
"Such a poetic lecher" they'll say of me.
"He'd oogle the asses while erecting his poetry."
This campus is sure to make a lecher of me.
Maleable clay faced children wait to be molded and shaped
Into permanance by the hand of the passing fancy of fate.
And where does that leave me?
To fuck someone without loving them is a very easy matter, but to love someone without fucking them is a very different matter.
As children we branded ourselve, placing symbols deeplybeneath the skin, penetrting each others flesh signifying oneness. 
The experience of beauty can be felt on a variety of spectrums, and to isolate your concept of beauty to the sexual spectrum is to feed all your experiences and interactions through the fuck meter, which is to eternally fuck yourself.
The burning of symbols into the skin was a climax and a permenaization. 
In our age we hesitate. 
The permenance and perfection of self and realm are far too delicate and volatile to let all that which is not self there ore not perfect.
Somehow this topic took its own course. 
The origin was just now in the liquor store. 
A girl in her twenties in line in front of me. 
Her packpack says animal, she is dressed like lazy california. 
The beach boys croon on about wouldn't it be nice. 
Several reactions occur at once.
That song first made sense when I was six. 
The five year old girl in the room was who my thoughts were singing to. 
The thought of waking up next to her in a house on the beach was nice. 
The song is rooted in me prior to sex entering my lirfe. 
This brought me to the sexless beauty conundrum. 
To appreciate a womans beauty on a nonsexual level seems obvious, but ... 
just saying it sounds fuckn absurd. 
Do any of us remember life before sex? The joy of beauty without vague burning hopeful lust?
TO fuck someone withouot loving them is a very easy thing. 
But to love someone without fucking them?
The city is separated into age groups, according to intended and not actual age. 
The permanently pubescent inhabit Telegraph, flashing hints of their sexual capacities as they pass.
Along Shattuck live those striving to seem adult, not with fake IDs, but with feigned decency.
And the old are everywhere, so well known that they are forgotten.
It's hard to do your own thing when your own thing is based on whatever is happening around you. 
I've got to find my own thing by avoiding everyone else's thing, and ignoring every trace of anything having ever occurred, and watching whatever is left unfold.
A sip on the old dollar store energy beverage,
Glancing up at the sea of gorgeous women streaming past. 
This campus will make a lecher of me. 
But before that, before the fuck meter took over, I fed on the old had exhuberance of youth. 
the optimistic naivate, waiting for experience to prove them otherwise. 
We measure and gauge the relative age by how grim the features, how set the expression. 
How weathered the features. 
How deep and retreated the essence. 
Don't stare too long little one. 
You'll see the creature come undone. 
There's an art to collapse, and these erratic breakdown bastards know.
And they will show you how perfectly formed is their flaw.
Perfected, chaotic, stagnation.
-----------------------
ROCKADAMUS FOREVER
We all laughed. 
Made up names for him. 
Pointed out our own special Pareidolia, and picked out our own special pebbles. 
The owner pointed him out to all his friends. 
Everyone had some vague edge of what the rock was and why it was special and how deep Rockadamus really was. 
His eye was sharp, and his poise was one willing to be watched. 
"A good one." we all agreed. 
A wingnut, perhaps. 
The common follow up was "perhaps he really has it." and we all secretly knew that he kinda did. 
kinda. 
But that's just about as much if not more than any of us can say, so.. 
there ya go. 
	I watched everyone crowd around him like he was especially special, and ironically he was. 
He proved it to them too, when he took them all to court for liable. 
Talkin all sorts of hoodoo shit about him, he sued their asses and good. 
At one point they had the rock take the stand, and the owner and all his friends couldn't stop laughing. 
And the judge banged the gavel and Rockadamus won. 
	Afterwards, at the press conference, Rockadamus handed out pamphlets on "How To Surrender To The Rock", and "Living Tween The Rock and A Hard Place", and "Rock, The Pamphlet". 
	The media ate him up. 
His sharp eye, poised, waiting for watchers. 
For listeners. 
For readers...
	He tells a good story.

EXPRESSION AGAINST THE SCREEN
Since the central goal is to prompt the act of expression, the central technique should be very detached from intellectualization and closer to the immediate and measurable experience of reality. 
If this is the central goal and purpose than simply the act ought to suffice, self justify, and such and so on. 
But sludging through this stream of quagulated phlegm, pushing against a stream of lights launching out of the screen, pushing eyes deeper in, pulling attention further out, further further away from the eself aware origins of mind and self. 
--------------------------------------------------------------
IT ENDED ON A WEDNESDAY
I'm sad 'cause it stopped
on a Wednesday.
And Wednesdays are always
"Whatever, oh well."
No Poetry, you see,
On Wednesdays.
That's what gets me.
------------------------------------
It's not as deep and heavy.
It doesn't knock me down.
Diluted    Muted
Inexpressive. 
Light and airy.
Cotton Kandy.
our playful games
are wasteful shames
and my rhymes
are stupid and childish
just like you.
---------------------------------------
So many options
Cliffs off which to step.
Ways in which to slip
stop the progress
dip back into that ol'
reservoir of oh my fuckin god.
And on and on and la de da.
------------------------------------------------
for a moment I toy with the thought of letting her be gone. 
And smiling back at all those pretty ladies. 
Ah, smiling back. 
What would that change? My bed traffic. 
My brain. 
her. 
She wouldn't smile at me the same. 
'course she'd smile, eventually. 
But not the same. 
Not deeply and eternally. 
I broke that again. 
Now when she smiles at me, it hides the cynical knowledge of my drunks. 
I love her. 
and that matters, goddamit.
why is now the only time I experience? Why is my sadness about her leaving more important than her existence? If she were to disappear never return and so on my sadness would linger on. 
She is merely a trigger for these emotions. 
Something to send the bleak landscape crashing down on you...
But something beyond logic. 
Like the card man said. 
Put the landscape back, next to your ex's head. 
and remember. 
It does matter.
It does fucking matter.
People care.
More importantly, you fucking care. 
And you're tired, but you kinda like that...
but we're gonna cut it off here. 
Time for bed.
--------------------------------------------
FIRST APPEAL
"What makes one piece pointed and purposeful and another pointless and petty?" He paused, at the peak of his pace path, twirling lightly on his loafers, he commenced his pacing. 
A scab on my face comes loose, the juice of yesterday's existence hardened into papyrus. 
on my way here I saw a woman crouching on the sidewalk observing a bug. 
I observed her and pondered what she saw in the bug. 
What made it worthwhile. 
A furrow in my mental skin shifted and i made a note to make a note.
Left with shreds again. 
The torn pocket threatens to let the wallet slip through my shredded jeans and with it my fading identity. 
What makes one piece worthwhile and another not?"
Talking about myself to myself seems to be self defeating. 
Listing woes written in vague metaphor won't cease the flow or reinvigorate the mojo. 
The matter at hand is experience. 
The crisis is this heavy blanket of inner self, ironically clouding the outside world from view. 
How much I've missed. 
How many chances avoided, ignored. 
At someone Else's behest.
Now rooted so deep, so distant, lost amidst the eternal list of internal things in me. 
Calm, shut. 
Down, up. 
Still though, something is there.
Back and forth bellowing about each one, so many excuses, complaints to turn up.
So many walls fortified by my faith that I know and I've been and I'm done and you're wrong. 
Just a long list of bullshit. 
 That which holds me back.
lack of ego lack of faith lack of enterprise and care
and the self righteous glare of self imposed pain and alienation. 
I stopped talking when i found no one understood the words I stumbled over, attempting to tell a three part joke that references breakfast this morning. 
You make me feel stupid because I'm smarter than you.
So I guess that puts us on the same page.
Or maybe you make me feel stupid because I'm stupid.
And interpersonal pontification is the point I've been avoiding, poking around in brain drawers filling the skull room with smoke and cravings.
What happened to the great tradition of crude cave drawings?
You see, that was at the dawn of expression, and complexity shows sophistication. 
Simple conversation and straightforward approachable pieces are shameful in the eyes of our highly specialized society. 
Less and less a day do we spend outside ourselves, preoccupied occupying our hollow bodies. 
Flecks of skin drift off and are eaten by bugs on the sidewalk.
A simple transfer of energy. 
Nothing really.
---------------------------
SECOND APPEAL
Perhaps this anxiety is nothing more than guilt for not producing, for not doing.
But music is existence, and expression is just a way to measure time, so simply being present is in truth producing something.
This anxiety acts as a screen, a grid of self analysis, holding me back from release.
So if this anxiety is what holds me back from producing, tan it truly is the most relevant topic.
And back we fall once more in to the mind chasm, but aware now of its infinite hollow depth and draining complexity. 
And so we step back once more and ghasp, suddenly unwilling to look in.
So hollow. 
Such an echo. 
So much smoke. 
Why so much smoke>
It's an external manifestation of the smouldering inner flame that we claim to be pursuing through our own dust filled bodies,
pulling back scabs to peer into inner hidden cavities, filled only with smoke and cravings. 
Little bug on the sidewalk being watched thinks he's the only one left in this post apocalyptic expanse.
Must've ended recently, co0nsidering the smoky breeze.
To survive, some rely on dagger laughter, staggering madly
who are these post rapture cr4ackejack bastards?
And why does their laughter win, echoing over this unquenchable din?
Too late to begin again? 
Too hollow and broken to build on>
Is the stench too strong to sing through, or is it me,
pointing madly at my own reflection, choking on my own demoniac laughter?
This apocalypse seems to live in me, the anxiety a small dose of its smoke,
The cravings a way to distract the bug and reinforce the hollowness.
It's hard to let go of an echo,
Anticipating it may be new this time, and if so I'll be the first to know.
Breathe in love breathe out fear
will it ever just be air? 
Not caught on the edge of unluck or whipping up the dust of a thousand broken songs.
Mere word choices angle the edges and flavor the air.
Word choice based on echoes occurring in the highly complex confines of cortex.
Yet it can't help but return to good or bad, alive or dead.
And the one thing we can't seem to keep is our choice of words determines our type of experience.
-----------------------------------------
THIRD APPEAL
And in that moment I glanced up and saw the croissant, held fast with plastic wrap,
filed quietly behind the display glass, light falling on it like perfection.
The presence and power of this croissant seems to echo deep and sweetly through me. 
And the world expands, and softly I grin.
But why the croissant? What truth does the flake butter pastry hold>
And how does it relate to everything else in this shifting ring toss
fall across yourself to pick up perfection and test it with the fiery kiss of cynicism..
Perhapst ehe plastic wrap adds glistening angelic depth, and display case lighting clarifies, it has earned its place.
It's there to be sold, placed by haphazard underpaid help.
Help that's been bought. 
Help that might trade part of its pay for that very croissant.
A tree reaches leaves to catch sunlight. 
We sit beneath because it doesn't mind.
At times we play these games to survive, others to just measure time.
Today these sheets of paper pass through my mental breeze way and clear out my smoke.
Random chatter, picking out bugs and food
dust and human space and the dust of mood clouding a room,
confusing in a very personal permanent way, confused a the permanence felt in this very room,
as th8is very dust from this very mind mood settles, and the others are only aware that something unsettling has crept in,
waiting for a breeze of quick distracting wind kiss to clear the air and clarify the here. 
The croissant seems dead now.
For all the lighting and layers of display all the vague references to its place as a luxury item
And how that relays to its place and the people paid to present it, all those silly layers fall away,
And once again it's just stupid food, and once again I'm just hungry.
It seems to be hunger season. 
But hunger dust will still leave with the breeze4.
And when you compare you're not really here.
You step inside to check your inner photo album against your skull window view.
Your memories lay in cellophane coffins, you watch them, wishing they'd move.
Your thoughts crawl up in front of your view.
I had a croissant once. 
Not much like that one. 
This one crouched on the edge of the out front tables
and caught the eye of every young dinner bun passing by.
And you're hungry because you won't eat the strange unfamiliar treat in front of you.
You hesitate because it's not quite the same. 
shrink wrap memories play games switching in the wrong name.
You hunger the safety of the prewritten way, you hunger the balance of fair play.
You hesitate to sit because God knows what you might be crushing and who might wish you gone.
But you're wrong. 
They wish you here. 
Back here.
------------------------
CHESS WITH CHECKERS
Your patterns only exist inside you. 
To assume they may be used as the basis or format of an exchange,
be it conversation or otherwise, is to play chess with checkers.
Something about how all of these thought were put down on the same paper, therefore they must be related.
But perhaps there's no paper big enough to trace the extensive network.
----------------------------------------
THE PERFECT INTRO
I keep thinking there is a perfect intro that will make everything that follows just fall into place. 
I've written about twenty intros so far, none of them justifying anything except perhaps a collection of intros, which is due to be release before this book. 
It would be a very tidy and consistent collection of pieces relevant and related instead of this sprawling mass of whatnot. 
This book pile thing seems half cocked and falling over, just like everyhting else in my life. 
So this intro is different, because fuck depth, and fuck intentionality, and fuck gumtpion, and fuck having access to the entirity of human accomplishment, and fhuck the continued dfevelopment of the pursuit of perfection and fuck trying to do b etter and make better and fuck tomrorrow and fuck yesterday, and fuck getting the fulcking spelling write, and fuck stupid run on rants that jsyut repeat the same childish resistance to finding what actually is. 
So is that the point? Do I have a reason to string all these scrambled shit stains together now? 
-----------------------------------------------
EUGENE
THE SUMMER THAT DIDNT LAST FOREVER
It wasn't everlasting either. 
It was just summer. 
Started early, ended late, so we thought it was forever. 
But we were wrong. 
That's how it goes. 
We are small people, and forever is much bigger than us. 
The summer started with me living in a garage, just like most of the things I'm involved in, fuckin garage. 
I had done some barter work that I found on Craigslist, and got paid in a dip whistle. 
I had designs to record some reggae tracks. 
Than, something happened. 
Shit, I haven't gotten that far yet. 
Nothing's happened yet. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
WHATS IN FRONT OF YOU
Is still like my madre use to say, "You take what's in front of you or you get nothing." But he doesn't know that. 
Thas why he didn't stop. 
The Hispanic prostitute looked after him, glancing down at her twin white poodles playing grab ass on the lawn.
He doesn't know because he's to active brain. 
He thinks it's over there and around the bend and not yet, because is not perfect. 
Oh, I coulda fucked him well. 
I woulda surprised his little white ass. 
She flicked her cigarette and stared absently down at the dogs, still immersed in their tussle
He couldn't see me. 
I felt his absence. 
---------------------------------------------
FEARSALE
I wound up in a thrift store today. 
A big ol' Saint Vinny's.Shit load of cowboy boots right at the front when you walk in. 
Nice. 
Springfield, Sweet Springfield, what did I ever do to thee? Thee northwest overcast sky was weighing down a bit extra today, mainly due to sleep deprivation, but I couldn't shrug it off. 
So I wandered over to the book aisle and wandered up and down, unsure what to look for. 
At first I opted for the book Kaol always knows he'll find, and I'm sure he'll find at least two more before he dies. 
A first or second edition big book for A.A. 
Sells for $60 or $70 online. 
Buy it for a buck. 
Oh, that reminds me. 
I wrote down some titles to see how I am at picking random books. 
See if I got a knack for spottin whatnot. 
I mean, I did alright bowling today. 
Maybe I'm good at spotting antiques too. 
I found them on a bookshelf labeled "antique books" so they actually weren't that hard to spot. 
All I had to do was pick out the titles to look up. 
But before that, I was in the End Times section. 
They have a whole friggen bookshelf dedicated to apocalypse prediction interpretations. 
What a fascinating collection of absurd hyper fear joy games being spouted clouding the heads and energies of humanity.
There is an antichrist and a false prophet and a beast, and this is the unholy trinity. 
There will be a president who solves problems (yes, he has to actually solve problems) and than gets all crazy. 
But that's normal, right?  There is a house and a senate filled with representatives who tell the masses false promises, false predictions, behind the same veil of false change. 
The False Prophet.And there is the judicial which is soon to be replaced by the military and or police. 
The Beast. 
There are 7 bowls to be poured out that do everything global warming promises to do. 
All these little tidbits about how soon and in what form our demise might be brought about a shift in my mood. 
Yes. 
This author on the back is a fucking dirt bag who sells fear like it's bad tweak. 
Or perhaps he believes it and feels compelled to study it, pressing on to glory in the graphic games that lie in store. 
Or perhaps ... 
perhaps it's just a job, and he just happened to acccidentally end up being an apocalypse expert. 
And it's not soemthing that he's even necisarrily interested in. 
And for some godless reason reading these predictions kinda cheered me up. 
If I have a problem with it, well, maybe4 we'll all just fucking burn away in the sun when the sky opens up, eh? Or go subnterranean and grow web feet and have babies who grow gills. 
Who fuycking cares. 
I'm fucking not . 
well, it';s interesting. 
I gotta give it that. 
Int4rpretign who an how and when, and there';s gonna be a tlaking statue of the antichrist who demands worship. 
And .,.. 
and... 
FUCK IT"S STEPHEN HAWKING! wait, is he dead?
---------------------------------------------------
IDEAS
I'm out of ideas. 
Oh, and aint that it. 
Fuck you.
Maybe that first line might be the breaking point I've been looking for. 
Waiting til I run out of ideas...
And yet even now I'm toying with ideas about my lack of ideas. 
I've been writing to myself again. 
I believe that's the problem. 
No audience in mind, no friend I'm hoping will chuckle at this. 
Just the thought that I'll come back and look at this again. 
God, what an empty pitiful space. 
Just a short little masturbatory loop to keep me spinning my wheels until the friction kills me. 
Spin your wheels. 
Show the world how your friction feels.
Shine your eyes. 
Share the length and depth of your lies. 
Show your teeth but not to me not to me.
(this last line is supposed to be me bashing my fists on the keyboard and breaking it in half and throwing it across the room, but i'm in the library right now. 
It's a decent library. 
i wish I weren't such a fucktard these days. 
I might actually like it. 
the shelves are blond wood, and the ceiling is stained one by fours. 
I guess blonde wood is alright for a public library.
pursuits of interconnectedness through expressions of self obsession. 
less meaningful scrappy shit pickets crawling from broken teeth torn wellspout.
i shrink to know what might be hid in these random...
This is fucking meaningless. 
This is fucking meaningless. 
I'm not doing a fucking thing. 
I'm not even enjoying myself.
At least when other people run away they fucking enjoy it. 
I can't even    ...
Am I missing something? Was there some fucking round of paperwork I never filled out or a bus I didn't get on? 
Thousands upon thousands of these things lay scrabbled out behind me like shit stain pain face GOD FUCKING DAMMIT
-----------------------------------------------------------
PART FOUR :: THE FALLING NOTES
What compels you? What pulls you along into chaotic improvisation? What will prompt change? The recognition of repitition. 
What might prompt you? Finding a clue as to your own completion.
Iǘe never had the notion to force my own reality, rather letting the wind decide where ought I abide. 
But too many times falling into scenarios headspac4es games and emotional mazes, too long have I lived at the whim of whoever happens along. 
I feel compelled to write a book that will change me. 
A book that will document what has changed me. 
To study that which changes us and makes us whatever we become. 
A study of internal mechanisms. 
Triggers and modifications. 
improvisiations and repititions. 
To live in anticipation of the next complication is to be always falling. 
To wait with baited breath at what might come next is to live in perpetual displacement., struck speechle3ss by the onslaught of untraceable elements. 
To study the passage of the past two months, to project it in comparison to the last two years and to superimpose that over this last decade of personal development is my goal in this writing project. 
Two months ago I left California to work on a farm in Oregon for a month. 
Get perspective on the vector I have become. 
To trace my Billy Circus maze through landscapes and head space.
During my time on the farm I learned to fall back into myself without getting lost in who I once was. 
Through this came such realizations as sthe art of rambling tends to interfere with subject matter. 
The only hope is that it loops back around and justifys itself. 
Once again itś a coffee shop scene. 
Quite the recurring setting. 
P[ossibly the only recurring element in this ramble. 
Todays is the Felton Remembers Parade. 
Fade backwards through a series of effectst hat emphasizes displacement, spiral zoom simultaneously in on a passing crow and a lollipop.
I must remind myself Iḿ putting this together for myself and must align it with waht I find compelling and proper. 
i cannot become clouded with commercial viability or perpoetual appeal. 
I cannot write an intro to the reader, only and intro to myself about what patterns and approaches can be expected. 
At one point this project was called the premature memoirs, but it hafter working on it for 10 years Iǘe renamed it the perpetual memoirs. 
My goal in writing and compilng this is to track the change of voice over the course of a decade under constantexperimentation and displacement. 
The outcome will be nothing more than a collection of things which is one of the many working titles I´ve given this project. 
CEASE THE RAMBLE! ON WITH IT!
ẗracin patterns in the sand.
screamin noise into the wind
let it all just fall down
into the mess that it is.
-Monkeyhands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He walks around like a haunted man. 
He has thoughts that wont come out. 
LImp are his hands. 
His pace is plodding. 
his pale lips give shallow breath. 
He is the century son. 
He has seen it stretching thin. 
The membrane shudders with his tired whisper. 
¨¨¨¨ I know not what to burn. 
¨¨¨
¨¨ bring me diamond souls that once awoke my faith, that we might burn together, for all is fire.¨¨¨
He counts the calls of a crow. 
Four loud, two soft. 
sixteen loud, two soft. 
fourteen loud, two soft. 
He creates a ramble that he himself cannot follow, sure that it holds clues as to what he might be trying to say, somethign he himself doesnt know. 
 Itś not just noise, nor is it a game, but he plays at both, finding clues and ways to breath. 
He digs away at his diamond of pain, feeling the noise and nonsense fade. 
Why these games of solitude? From whence these trimmings of death? 
This is all big talk, and it chokes us. 
Only big talk and it wall always be toppling over its own realizations. 
No small talk to cushion dilute and soothe, only reeling realizations, and we quickly become old and hopeless, casting off the flimsy expression of our fellow mortals, condemning our own brief forays into amiable interaction.
I seek that which is
But is it found in my past,
some unfounded future,
or within the folds of the book I refuse to write?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can only be sure of one thing at a time. 
We step from truth to truth like stones in a river. 
I know that thes thoughts are mine. 
I know that Iǘe been pulled taut and tired like the skin of a ballook, and soon release will send me spitting wet breath around the room, and I might be left at a book signing table, my wrinkled balloon face blank and faithless. 
I fear the pen for it steals my brain and leaves it stained there for others to play with. 
I fear the page for the imprint, the soul print it keeps it holds in infamy. 
For the mark you leave is all that you take with you. 
My deep talk is filled with pretentiousness. 
My snmall talk thin and unambitious. 
Iǘe lost somehting. 
I don know what. 
But Iḿ sure that it isn o longer where it was. 
The truth moves and stagnation is death. 
And falling is that which is between what was and whatś next. 
I can hold on no longer. 
Let the falling begin.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My name is Michael and I wrote this book. 
I struggle with writing because my internal narrator cannot agree with my internal teleprompter who blames the big producer in the sky who sent down his only begotten script writer, and in the end we are but ashes in the can. 
The old man is me criticizing and derailing and rearranging my work. 
This effort is aimed at what might prompt continued writings, and how one might come upon their natural style and subject matter. 
This prompts the question of whether the term ¨natural" can be applied to creation or whether we are resisting the stage direction of the only begotten script writer.
What to write is the most constant and absurd question. 
This book (or at least this section of the book) approaches this question by first exagerating it, and than ignoring it. 
Iĺl write about Writing, Science Fiction, Action Adventure, Romance, and Mystery. 
Why? Because to troly be real it must reference everything. 
There is but one genre, that of expression. 
And since the goal is to hold your attention, all else is oh so very Irrelevant. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The old man took my notebook and began to read aloud...
¨¨¨ And language ist he biggest falacy of all, because we consider it to be us expressing ourselves, but it is the world using us to express Itself. 
We are the medium and therefore we assume to have access to the message, which causes a hyperactive anxiety, because the message is not found in language, but in our actions. 
A list is a mechanism for coping with anxiety. 
It is a way for the individual to remind themselves that they know what they are doing.
A list is useless if one lacks the capacity to cease the analytical intellect and move into a mechanical intellect in the form of literal action. 
These words feel sleek, shiny, dispassionate metal. 
This analysis of functionalist expression is as thin and flat as any to do list, and the shift int o a self referencing narrational voice is as predictable as pickle juice in a pickle jar.
These words are paper; flat and dry. 
Ityś the curse that haunted many past authors: the fear that everything is predictable. 
The growing awareness that many people have many petty expressions of self obsession, but we prive in our narrations that we are the most self absorbed of them all. 
A subtle play, when he mentions and emphasizes that which they lack, he is suggesting that he has the answer. 
Is this the role of a social critic? To analyze archetypes and condemn cultural role playing?
Or is the only real point skittering right now along the thin blue horizon that balances the stream of ball point bile.
Perhaps itś a new style that youŕe prefecting. 
Or perhaps itś been so long since inscription amplified your thoughts and youǘe forgotten, the only way to find it is to get lost in the flowing tumble of word sound. 
Same choice a thousand times a day, whether it makes any sense or is necisarry. 
The other option is how itś all so wonderfully obtuse, camping on the edge of guild and logic until life overwhelms and we find ourselves falling along in unison towards the totally unexpected. 
If itś an exercise or an expulsion of demons, it needs to be done. 
I seem only to glorify the act, and truly I am lost as to what the subjct matter might be proper aside from the act of expression.
This seems to be another lesson test experiment. 
A flow of automatic thought aimed at repitition with variation. 
Is it 12 or 18 basic plot lines? And what are the 9 major archetypes? And what religion does the Italian clown tradition correspond with again? 
Take any words and youĺl find them aligned in dozens of origins and part of all the same vague ¨beyond the blue" game. 
Already heś showing signs of idiocy. 
He shakes his fist at the ceiling every night before bed. 
Heś lost the power to express. 
His fists are dry and cracked from working his back is stiff his spit is thick. 
Similarly clogged are his capacities to process.
He spits his ferocious raspiness and his audience laughs at the cracks in his voice. 
Heś been nursing and growing his furious noise, but before he unleashes he must learn to turn it away from his pitiable fellow humans and towards the buildings and plans, traditions and practices that keep them stifled dull and lifeless. 
i sat with stifled humanity for a spell and convinced myself that everything was doing quite well. 
-----
Maybe I'm trying too hard, maybe I'm not trying at all. 
Maybe all my efforts go into all the wrong tasks, a set of perfectly polished tools, and not a scrap of meterial to work. 
Don't let them ever tell you you're smart. 
Don;t listen when they say you're gifted. 
It's their only way to destroy your joy : Encase it in trimmings which grow into obligations. 
The servant who buried his talent is a wicked servant, while the servant who multiplied his talents is worthy in the eyes of the lord. 
Diversification prevaricates longevity. 
Jesus was a stockbroker!
Am I trying too hard or not hard enough? We've tried at many things and ended up getting somewhere serval times, but energy is always slipshod, and delivery scrambled and stuttering. 
Creative expressionw as the goal. 
It had been for years. 
Ever since we filmed Hail Norton, a homework assignment that began with the goal of being a five minute fellini esque short, but quickly spiraled into 25 minutes of rambling randomness, moving between time periods and character sets and story lines and symbologies, and ambiance effects and such adn so on. 
The central message was something about art for arts sake. 
The opening quote was ...
"Consistency is not as important as the energy of a story."
and the closing quote was
"If we stop moving now we may never move again!"
So it seems fitting that this film project should figure prominently in the decade of displacement. 
I suppose evertyones goal int he twenties is to get back home, whatever that means. 
Rediscover, reinvent home. 
But I've been stuck ever since graduating, pursuing this whole bullshit success thing. 
It has sapped me of creative energies, crippled my self esteem, and repeateldly launched me chatocially nowhere. 
My goal has always been tow rite, even the wrong stuff! Even the badly written stuff! It's a demonstration! Or it juxtaposes the silence! Or it forces ther eader to acknowledge the literal flesh and blood humanity of the author. 
	QUANTUM
INTRO----------------------------------------------------------------
	Prompt :  EVERYTHING is prayer.
Whether you look at the screen when you type, sending your awareness towards, praying to technology,
Whether you stare forward over the screen out into the room, out the window into the world, out the world over the horizon into the next idea, praying to potential,
Whether you close your eyes or have had them closed for you and bask praying to the abstract capacities of the human mind to prompt and perpetuate realms logics and experiences that aren’t literally occurring, praying to thought,
Whether you stare at the keys observing each symbol, watching the fingers fall gracefully into place, ticka rattle tatata tating, praying to the synthesis of thought, technology, and potential,
Or if you type one word at a time, one thought, one moment, and glance around the room, pausing, waiting, noticing one perfect item or thought to be encased in digital space heavy with pause, moving slow enough to pray to the entire universe. 
We’ll talk more about that later. 
	UNDERLYING MECHANISMS
Autonomous Education  (A.E.) 
Creative Expressions Therapy. 
(C.E.T.)
	To develop and present these concepts, fictional characters are made to discuss the subject matter, so that each one can fully believe whatever thoughts I'm toying with, leaving me free to continue my cynical predilection. 
The characters provide an actual demonstration of how one might use self guided education techniques (A.E.) to develop their own course of C.E.T. 
which results in a more intentional version of self that is more capable of contributing positively to their surroundings.
	ONE LAST TIME
	What follows is a series of psychological proposals developed by the author over the last ten years aimed at helping writers churn up their inner whatnot. 
They occur in the form of character fictions which embody various personality traits and or belief systems the author has contemplated acquiring, studying the effects of traits on types and systems on specifics in the realm of personality, and how it is embodied in the various realms of acquaintancehood. 
Rest assured, the author is much more sane than when he started this project, which is proof that it's a worthy endeavour to chore through the chapters and prompts. 
Join me, dear reader, in the sacred role of scribe, and take the prompts I've gathered to trigger your own streams of expression and awareness. 
And send them to me at slightlydistracted@hotmail.com so that I may bask in the onslaught of absurdity I hope to have triggered.
CHAPTER ONE ---- CALL ON THE MUSE
	An ancient tradition of epic poetry and such is the call on the muse. 
This is an almost impossible task for the excessively cynical or logical, because the muse is that experience which frees us from such anchors of expression. 
Jack the Bastard struggles to understand this summons, which makes him incapable of truly experiencing it. 
Laughing Peter seems to be permenantly in the company of the muse, which is why he never writes anything down : Because to him it never seems temporary. 
	Those who wish to follow along and duplicate the prompts are advised to find a pastoral setting, hypnotize yourself, (see appendix : self hypnosis) and when word thoughts become thin and ignorable, seek out that which prompts your very existence and thus might prompt the epic expressions fermenting inside of you.
---------------------------------------------------------------
	Jack the Bastard sat down once more and began ticka tap rattle smashing the letters of the keys of the board, as if the impact of each symbolic drop onto each letter shape might summon more momentum and keep him launching on into the sea of expression he so longed to drown in floundering sputtering hounding the siren of sound prompting thought ensuring the enduring analog digital abstract literal dance between thought and occurence. 
Peter came dancing into the room, doing sloppy twirls with a sleek shoot of crystal encasing a throatful of champagne. 
Eleven, and already the monkey is high as a kite on his bubbly. 
Must be a sale at Rocky Lickers. 
"Come dance, Jack! Dance to your youth, and MY Beauty! Dance for it is the spring of our lives and we shall not be trod on by winners filling us losers with their discontent."
"Hangonhangonhangon! I'm trying to write. 
Quit your monologue and lemme finish." Eyes still on his typing, he plunged his attention further, seemingly through the paper, like a martial artist throwing blows beyond the target. 
"You'll never make it if all you do is try! DO!" 
"Enough of that shit. 
There's nothing left to "DO!" These scrambley Scribbled Ramblings sound like some adolescent homage to our wholely unwholesome host of scribularium of America. 
The poems , ... 
oh lord. 
Don't get me started on the poems. 
Pure shit. 
giggley swooney phermone junk."
Peter lowered his bubbly down from aloft, holding it at his teat like a babe. 
"You try for things you don't do naturally. 
You always have. 
If you allowed yourself to simply fall into what mess may come.."
"I'd end up like you!" Jack said looking up accusingly.
"Oh! God forbid! I don't mean as a lifestyle. 
The daily choice of freefall is one which only those who have been chosen can survive. 
Touched by an angel you know. 
Dropped on my head."
"You are different people one moment to the next." 
"That's an ugly way of saying it. 
I am wholely here whenever I want. 
Dropping my concept of self as easy as a cape with a crap design on the back. 
And when I return in two months time, you'll only know my eyes, for all else that might signify self will have changed. 
And I will pity you, oh sadly consistent. 
Mocking me as I climb from monkey form to monkey form, the scales fallen from my eyes, and you, oh sad scalely lizard creature, too encased in armor to bend gracefully enough to soften and feel the sun and reach and grown and shrink and glow with the true god of intentional evolution physical mental and spiritual." Peter had been walking slowly in a circle, examining each of the walls as he slowly sank towards the floor, ending his speech by slumping into a crosslegged seat, chin to his chest, shoulders slumped foreward, his flute of white now empty and sideways on the tattered mexican blanket rug. 
Jack suddenly realized why he loved and hated peter so immensely. 
Its not my job to write down all the poetry! Why do you drop these words on the floor and drift into silent oblivion? God knows where your mind goes after such displays of poignancy. 
Why do you cast your pearls, not even before swine, but randomly, as if they might continue to flow forever. 
As if these werent the jewels of eternity popping up into our daily language before we can even recognize, only when we're not searching for it, DAMMIT!! What the hell did he just say?! I'll capture the edge of it. 
Some lateral issue.... 
  I hate his monologues. 
'cause he doesn't write 'em down. 
You can't just drool one out like a street schizo and let it drift oft into the nethersphere. 
...
I guess that's why I keep him around. 
What can I salvage from that?...
------ Abandon Hope Yee Who Enter Here -------
(from the desk of J.T.B. 
Esq)
This contemporary age is ruled by a fear of literal existence. 
A hesitance to take an intimate hand in our setting, striking up the odd vibration to tap into literally taking part in our actual existence. 
The infinite and unpredictable external stimuli that assault us throughout our daily lives. 
Whatever syllables you choose to decorate the concept, it seems at times to be resisting life itself. 
Could it be.. 
a fear? Of feeling? No! I feel things! 
"What does the inside of your jacket feel like? how bout the chair you're sitting on? what does the mouse feel like in your hand? the keys beneath your fingers? the toes choked up with cotton inside your socks, crammed into shapely mini-hills with your shoes. 
You sir, are a piece of architecture. 
Put together through a delicate lack of structural awareness, draped over with ignorant semi-random textiles. 
We only feel what we leave exposed, leaving 97% of our body permanently exposed to constant friction contact and suffocation with excessive layering and protections against the very necessary weathers that our bodies are kept in shape by. 
The salt water of the ocean naturally detoxifies the body, the wind ruffles and softens hair and relaxes the muscles and prompts blood flow while keeping the air fresh and crucial. 
The further from nature we get the less we want to feel, the more layers we put on, the more buildings walls and fences there are between us and the non-concrete. 
Jack leaned back perusing his words, unhappy. 
He felt a presence. 
glancing up sharply, he nearly collided with Peter who was reading over his shoulder, his head perched several inches from Jack's, hovering like a conscience. 
Jack felt slightly invaded. 
"You're a nudist!" offered Peter jovially. 
"You've just come out of the... 
outfit." He began twirling again, this time throwing off pieces of clothing. 
A hat went one way. 
a glove from his pocket flew another. 
His second glove threw a third way, his scarf a fourth. 
Jack spun around in his chair to address the verbal assailant.
"You misunderstand. 
I'm not advocating nubidy. 
The layers are a metaphor. 
You can't be so literal."
"Nah. 
All metaphors are literal. 
And that's not a metaphor." Peters eyes were doing that slide to the right, jump left, slide to the right, jump left thing that eyes do inside of a head that's recently been spinning. 
He was temporarily silenced by the swirling, giving Jack a chance to explain. 
"We keep our most sensitive self safe and unseen at all times. 
The mind. 
Thus it must be with our external selves, letting part, some, even most show throughout the day, but our bodies, like our minds are made up of such an array that to prompt all senses simultaneously will leave the self raw and eventually calloused. 
Perhaps we keep nudity as a special occurrence because that way nudity can act as its own aphrodisiac, keeping such things as simply and natural as anyone might prefer." Peter's brow furrowed. 
He didn't like logic to prevail. 
Life is emotion. 
a series of shifting swirling systems that one would be a fool to cling to, and Jack wasn't going to win this one with his advocacy of fear and the reductive shirking lifestyle logic. 
He retorted;
"And perHAPS you just need to get past the death shroud of guilt you've nurtured throughout your life towards the glorious form that we have been graced with... 
If you can shrug off the putrid cape of shame that makes you hide your sensitivities lest those who run these systems that feed and shelter us might cast a dark eye on us for neglecting to hide in shame our opinions and our fleshy things."
"Our opinions and our fleshy things. 
very nice. 
But shouldn't we rather be cherishing our opinions and fleshy things? Cherishing them by protecting them from they that might threaten becoming so wholely immersed in your new motherlife world realm that you were incapable of keeping in touch with said old realm or any sort of seperate concept of self which is a very useful tool in the search for truth, even if the rumor about it being an illusion is true."
"Aw Shit. 
Man!! You semantician. 
I'm a fuckin poet and you're taking me to court. 
What the hell is this. 
fuckin inquisition over here." 
"No! It's crucial. 
What, you scared to be exposed? Mental nudity? Exposure of your true core concepts? Can you take it?"
CHAPTER TWO :: THEO JAMES AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPRESSION
	Theo James is the teacher of our two heros, and the source of their befuddling assignments. 
As a fresh mind in a dead world, Professor James struggles to fit or to be understood or to prompt anything fresh from the mid twenties child minds he's confronted with daily. 
His experience with students has brought him to the belief that the best thing a teacher can do is to excite the student into self propelled education. 
This being his goal, it's also his approach, which causes his subject matters to become rather convoluted and innertwined. 
	To duplicate this prompt, find your three favorite subjects and improvise a lecture connecting these unrelated disciplines. 
(anthropology, graphic arts, psychology, fishing, whatever) jot down notes on each, find a podium with no audience (its much harder to improvise connections between unrelated disciplines when people are watching) and record yourself explaining why these three topics can be used as the basis for a complete understanding of how and why the world works or doesn't work.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
	"Doctor Theo James will be speaking to you today class. 
He's a very old friend of mine and an expert in the field of Social Self Psychology, which is the least paying job in the field, so give him an extra rousing round of applause, as it's the least we can do to gesture our appreciation. 
Mister James?"
	A rattle eyed fifty year old approached the stage, shifting his brown corduroy coat and scratching behind his ear and under his thin unkempt beard. 
He grabbed the mic and talked sideways into it, always looking towards the wings, never directly at the actual group of about a thousand students attending the psychology summit. 
	"He's right! The janitors get paid more than me at the place I'm working." James said, an affable sense of buoyant humor behind his depressing revelation. 
"But I guess I'm a janitor too. 
I go around and clean up peoples mental shits. 
Our brains, like our bodies, have many toxins and biproducts that require daily expulsion. 
just like our bodyshits, our brainshits require specific setting and stimuli to be extracted in a healthy manner.
	"Those in labor and service often times have less constapation, along with a more stable family life. 
Inversely, those in management positions show higher signs of intestinal disruption paired with a tendency to force shows of small talk good spirits from the plebians. 
Ah... 
sweet plebia. 
Font of my youth...
	"I rode the bus here today, I enjoy the bus because it's the most intimate experience of the city. 
It's often times the more poor half of the area but these folk tend to be more inclined to take part in their surroundings and take part in some form of community..." Doctor J. 
shuffled his papers and glanced around the pulpit looking for some clue as to what he was there to discuss. 
"...community, historic context.. 
diversif.. 
AH!!  That WAS it. 
I was right after all. 
Why do the lower economic ranks tend to be more community oriented?" a pleased chuckle was heard through the audience. 
James glanced around to see what they found amusing. 
Nothing. 
Back to the presentation. 
He approached the giant whiteboard and wrote in foot high letters
" TRAUMANOMICS "
stepped back, smiled, nodded, and turned back to the pulpit. 
"Traumanomics dictates a fear based investment strategy that fails to diversify in times of need. 
This demonstrates an economic and social involvement that is purely motivated by self interest with self deprecating shortsightedness..." The place was dead silent. 
 ot the sound of a pen scratching. 
only Theo James scratching. 
"Didja get that?" A thousand students shook their head no in unison. 
James looked down, than back at the white board. 
10, 20, 30 seconds. 
Finally he burst into movement, drawing shapes on the board. 
the shapes seemed almost meaningless, only serving to keep his hand moving to keep his brain moving so that he wouldn't get overrun by the thought process, rather oscillating between a literal occurrence and an abstract one that might hopefully somehow naturally parallel each other. 
He wasn't sure what he was doing. 
He had just forgotten to write notes on a presentation, since he'd been losing sleep over the phenomenon of the inconsistent self. 
 This concept seemed crux in approaching education, job placement, rehabilitation, family psychology, and everything it means to be human. 
It all seemed to him inextricably bound to this notion that one can be a self and a speck simultaneously and without cognitive dissonance, rather identifying the cognitive dissonance as coming from a system that is incapable of approaching this inevitable truth. 
	"Alright! Traumanomics. 
The bombs all go off! Everything dies. 
The only ones who survive are in this very room. 
you thousand students, and me, your leader! In this case I expect to be ousted from my role quite quickly, looking around the room I see approximately a thousand better leaders. 
I am just a professional student who demonstrates the act of learning for you enthusiastic students. 
Thus, I am no leader. 
Just a doctor. 
Who will lead? the poet? the warrior? the business man? It doesn't matter. 
The students will build the world, as they always do. 
And their bosses will steal the credit. 
As they always have. 
	And so! What world shall we build, my humble leaders? No plants will grow. 
No green plants anymore. 
Only the corn. 
Only the ten thousand acres of Monsanto Corn grown subterraneanly in this very soil. 
The corn potatoe. 
Corayto. 
A strange invention, but the first post nuclear vegetable created by man, and quite possibly our salvation. 
And so! we will create a system of credits. 
There are enough coraytos for everyone. 
And we shall all get our share of 350 coraytos which will last each person long enough to learn to hunt and find buried seeds that they might cultivate in the rare untouched scraps of earth with life still in it." 
	Doctor James stared down at the stage, slightly swaying, as if he'd put himself in a trance. 
His head shook gently side to side. 
And with a quick twitch he was back. 
"AND SOME! Some there will be who find uses for the corayto that no other could find. 
The inside of the skin can be preserved in the green leaves, buried three feet deep, surrounded by gravel beneath and a bark lid above to keep the dirt out. 
and when it has sat for a week or more, it can be undug and used as a bandage of sorts. 
The stalks can be textiled and woven into string into yarn into clothes. 
The leaves can thatch roofing. 
The flesh of the fruit can be used as bait in hunting. 
The leaf and the root when boiled release their bitterness and become palatable, otherwise causing severe stomach crampings. 
The flesh of the root will sooth burns, the skin of the root will treat rashes. 
It makes tolerable beer, if hop extract and yeast are to be had, and the moonshine it makes is fire. 
	Perhaps one person could manage to think of all these uses, but even so, the infrastructure is too diverse and extensive. 
If we do not gather together, the thousand of us, make a list of our various capacities, another list of what we believe to be important, and a third list of what we think we need, and use these three lists to triangulate several interlinked ideology groupings inside of which will be several implementology groupings, inside of which will be several expertise groupings... 
uh oh. 
I feel zombie eyes on the back of my neck." Theo James glanced back from his drawing, at the students who were looking a bit befuddled. 
So he drew three circles, and within each circle, he drew three more circles, and within those circles, he drew three more circles. 
	"In our current universe these various realms, looks like there's twenty seven of em. 
I dunno though. 
depends on how you look at it. 
Well, the three big circles are the three big ideologies." He began writing long drawn out titles next to each large circle.
1: This life is life, and to deny that is to die to life.
2: I owe my life to my ancestors and I must understand my role as a link.
3: This life is imbued with the mystery of existence which we are meant to pursue as a groom pursues his new bride naked through the primeval woods.
James stepped back and looked at what he had just written. 
He looked back at the students who were more baffled than when he had started. 
	"Uh... 
Traumanomics dictates a reductive experience of reality which means we as individuals allow ourselves to only inhabit one of these three spheres, when this actually cuts us off from a full understanding of our potential and capacities and true self, which is not meant to be consistent, because it is a verb, and those with a static self are those who are more inclined to destroy themselves and those around them."
	It was as though a very heavy thick shroud of existential dilemma had been lifted. 
 Theo glanced around happily. 
"Did it make sense?! Did it make sense?!" The students were sighing and sitting back, slumping. 
Theo continued mumbling to himself. 
"They listened. 
The whole room listened!! I only wish I could remember what I said! I hope it was good." As they gushed out clacking and stomping, he remembered to call out "DONT FORGET THE HOMEWORK! TWO PAGES ON WHAT CLOTHES DO TO THEIR OCCUPANTS." 
CHAPTER THREE :: OUTFIT AS INPUT EQUALS UNFIT OUTPUT
	To get a better understanding of our internal mechanisms its helpful to observe the external results. 
The most obvious and constant representation of this is the clothes we choose to wear. 
Put on the outfit of the person you want to be, and simply observe its effects on you. 
start literal, with how it changes your posture, breathing patterns, and visual focus point. 
This struggle to exist within some other creature's confines tends to result in a rather unexpected back and forth between the conscious and subconscious mind, and perhaps this is the crux of our biscuit ::: 
o trigger a conversation between our conscious and our subconscious minds. 
so here goes jack, trying to be a grown up, wearing his grandfather's suit and a rabbit fur hat. 
(He never really explained the rabbit fur hat. 
Perhaps its a linus blanket left over from his childhood) 
	get that top button. 
 ow tuck in the front, feel it tighten. 
Yes, a finely sprung tuning fork. 
feel the pleats of your pants remind your legs what straight is. 
and the soles of your shoes, grounding your stance. 
the drape of your coat against your back, pulling the chest tight up and back, opening the airways, sending the gaze strangely spacedly into nowhere. 
the soft rabbit fur hat pressed against my eyes still feels a bit like an animal, but it doesn't reek of death like one would expect from the shreds of a carcass. 
the leather and rubber of shoe feel like knobby tool fixtures, easily replaced with a flat head or a phillips. 
All these details, down to the parts of my hand that feel most cold, top of my three big knuckles, and the underside of my left pointer. 
I suppose there's some heirarchy there. 
My left pointer seems the most susceptible to cold, while my right pointer is still stiff and frictious from the hand saw injury. 
enough of self observing self. 
the body responds to the subconscious demand for the thoughts to become ticky tacked out into some resemblance of biproduct. 
What the hell is he doing? observing the observer being observed. 
What about this crux is so fixatable for him.? Does he consider it a double blind test of humanity as a whole? to constantly talke one step to the left and turn around? does this do anything aside from confuse and perpetuate an instable concept of reality?
And can this be considered a writing style? To put on a nice suit, comb the hair, get all church spiffy, and sit at the alter of expression blindfolded? You're chasing your tail. 
You wish to show the world that they as well chase their tails in far less enjoyable forms? You wish to demonstrate the world being self obsessed and building a tiny realm of self world that only pulls from reality as it becomes agreeable? 
Or are you tracking this down for your own perusal to evaluate your own paper trail, to find out whether these drills of subconscious stimulation, disciplined skepticism and faith in hope, faith in search, faith in stepping out of old versions of self are of any real use to anyone?
And now at this new threshold, Dec fourteen twenny thirteen, twenty two days til I'm twenty nine,  I feel yet another set of skin ready to peel away and fall. 
Unsure and scrambley rambley as usual, take this advice from that one time you really thought about it. 
Engage reality.
Dance in the sun religiously. 
eat often and well and water too.
don't get stuck in a friends reality. 
visit. 
don't feel obligated to discuss things you aren't fully formulated on.
shun only the loveless for they cannot recognize or appreciate love.
pay your own way. 
only travel broke if you're not visiting friends. 
get a job.
oh shit. 
drug class on Tuesday.
(at the bottom in scrawled gibberish is James's response)
You start literal and invite the reader to join you behind the curtain. 
You court your cognitive dissonance. 
You clarify cognitive dissonance as a tool of change.
You question your goals, your capacities, your realities.
You end with what you seem to have learned from your quick little experiment.
I've watched you loiter here at the community college for six years now, and your homework is becoming more and more consistently concerned with being perched on some sort of threshold of realization. 
While this threshold is very real, the evaluation of it will diminish in realism the longer the observer chooses to loiter in stagnant static approach to self and expression. 
What's your major?
------------------------------
Jack read the scribbled response and snorted. 
He tossed the paper on the bed and walked to the window, lighting a smoke as he approached. 
"What's my major. 
What a dick." Jack said to his cigarette. 
The tobacco crackled in response as Jack took a long hard draw. 
"A major entails a static self. 
What is this? cornered. 
painted in. 
Proof in the pudding. 
What job could I hold right now? food service or manual labor. 
God, I hate teachers. 
They make no one want to teach. 
Jack sat down and jotted down his own set of notes in response.
self observing self evaluating
literal self     (static)
observing self   (abstract)
local self     (dynamic)
his is why we have to be "in our element" to make sense. 
Because the literal and abstract need a complementary setting to triangulate into dynamic.
ake a selfie, that's your static self. 
        write a 3 page bio, that's your dynamic self.
go throughout your day, interacting as you tend to with those around you... 
that's your local self.
static self and dynamic self are two abstract nouns that only serve to triangulate and modify the local self. 
My studies focus on ways for individuals to anchor perpetual self improvement as an element in their core concept of self.
As of yet, the core concepts of self are...
AUTONOMY : Learning to watch your brain argue with itself, acting only as mediator.
EXPRESSION : Learning to refine your inner language avoiding stagnation and false loops.
IMPLEMENTATION : Learning to translate your conclusions into the external realm to be tested by fellow homonids.
Jack sat back and glanced over his scribblings. 
He approved. 
There was thought here, imbued with much intention. 
Professor James's feed back didn't seem quite so obnoxious anymore. 
just an old fart trying to do what he's supposed to, which is tell students they're wrong. 
Jack tossed his notes onto the bed with the paper, and grabbed a fresh notebook. 
Rare that one gets the chance to scar the first virgin page of a notebook. 
one in a hundred times, at most. 
one in a thousand if it takes you more than a day to fill up a page. 
But than, I DO tend to fill my pages with a lot of cock and bull. 
Bah! This one will be different. 
bloated with content. 
Too thick with worthy tidbits for any man to ever fully understand. 
Yes. 
It shall be grand!!

HOW TO TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY
Ideas & Projects  become  Models & Experiments become Theory and Practice
The world will make a massive leap in living standards once we all learn to consider every life to be a crucial experiment in essence expression.
Experiments are innovation, projects are games, and practice is the old way. 
Every life needs all three. 
Ideas are dreams, Models are hopes, and Theories are plans.
Every life needs all three.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We as humans tend to end up with 3 realms of need…
Social, Sexual, and Psychological.
Or, as Hippie Sam says,
Cooking, Plumbing, and Farming. 
What this all means remains to be seen.

	NOTES ON THE AUTHOR
	I lived in Berkeley from September 2007 until December 2010, at which time I had received my degree, worked at Caffe Med for a year and a half, made friends with all the homeless people, written a novel, started a band, took part in zine production and t-shirt making and garage recording and weird awkward college one night stands with co-workers and co-students, … Berkeley was many many many many things, and I have yet to address it as a concept chapter shaping factor in my life. 
So here goes…
	WHEN/NOW : THE EXODUS
	And in that time of great strife the cook didst fall out of favor with the homeless of the city, when it was falsely proposed by a bloody toothed grim that there had been a pushing…
Sad cook said no, but struck dumb by bloody tooth he chose rather to ban said grim.
And so, said cook perused his crowd, purloined their sounds, and laughing sadly, left his town. 
Ce’st la loque, and que mas de aqui? No por mi. 
So he left, and if you hadn’t guessed, read Ulysses.

	The basic premis of apophenic stimulation is that any time a random pattern makes you think of a landscape or face, your brain superimposes one specific example memory. 
Thus our hallucenations can be seen more as memory attacks giving us clues as to the root of our subconscious psychological workings.

DSI ETC
Parallel Disciplines
Gardening, Music, and cooking.
Each entails a product, an origin, and an audience. 
Each can be considered a pursuit of perspective in search of self knowledge.
This self knowledge is found through finding similarities and differences between the self and others, thus its place within a larger system, which leads to pursuing parallel disciplines which lead to
Strategic Partnerships
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
DUE DILLIGENCE
Every project entails due diligence, but in the business realm this is strictly related to paperwork and money. 
Those who manage to pursue their discipline despite economic irrelevance, and/or a lack of paperwork are those who have made a personal choice to integrate their discipline into their daily lives, not relegating it to a mere day job, wherein they are forced to sacrifice their personal approaches and beliefs. 
	My goal is to present a format for community event planning wherein 1 cook, 1 musician, and 1 gardener can demonstrate three universes comingling and successfully developing harmonies through their differences. 
That’s the music metaphor. 
The cooking metaphor comes into play when three individuals stew in the personal disciplines of each other. 
At last you are not A cook, you are THE cook. 
There are no other cooks around to misunderstand your recipes and techniques. 
Only a gardener and a musician, two fellow artists who strive to maximize the functionality of our inevitable frictions.
The gardening metaphor is too immense. 
It is the Novel I have yet to write.

SCREENING TEST
Once we get past the metaphors there is complex interpersonal chemistry bound to cocur in any group and cannot be predicted.
Instead we must develop a screening process that seeks out realist improvisers with a knack for pacifying the aggtravated. 
We need people who don’t compromise their own beliefs but can work on the same project with starkly contrasting approaches. 
People who can disagree and still work together. 
Communicative capacities are crux.
Knowing how to respectfully disagree.
Musician decides set list,
Cook decides menu,
Gardener decides ambiance,
Meetings held to line things up and match each others project, but in the end it can be, (and should occasionally be) 3 totally unrelated genres, themes, and color schemes.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SOFT LUNCH NOTES
We did our test run and learned…
-100 people showed up for free food and music
-50 of them read the poster
-25 of them signed up for the newsletter
-3 remembered me a year later, but they already knew me
-I aggravate and alienate the grown ups from my childhood and should find someone else to talk to them.
-Partners expect things, no matter how clear you feel, everyone needs to write out and sign project hopes and expectations and post project obligations.
-Talk to the local business district before… or.. 
fuck it. 
Call a reporter and make a scene. 
Get arrested yelling something memorable for headlines.
-Pamphlets (variety)
-cartoons on pamphlets
-background music between sets
<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
SYNESTHESIA AND SYNTHESIS
A good gardener will utilize any fencing or posts as a support for tall plants, just as any true musician will strive to integrate the inevitable sounds of the landscape into his performance, just as a cook will base his menu on budget, equipment, weather, and audience. 
Having input from 3 professions will clarify a variety of parallel applicable truths.
The average individual is losing mental capacities through neglect, and the best way to remind humans how to learn and actively apply new knowledge is to demonstrate the experience.
?????????????????????????????????????????????????
TURNS AS TEACHER
The first visual I’m given is the 3 pros taking turns as teacher. 
Firsdt a gardening segment with the gardener teaching the cook and musician
-soil science
-starting seeds
-cold frame design
-crop rotation
-companion planting
-harvesting and seed saving
This part may just be pageantry. 
Witty banter, etc.
The cook shows the other two
-veggie/meat selection & pairing
-spice identification & pairing
-saute / souve / ceviche
-eat with your eyes first, than your nose, than your fork, and finally your mouth.
And than the musician shows how to jam. 
“Hey cook, what’s your favorite phrase?”
“I dunno.”
“perfect. 
Gardener. 
What’s your favorite question?”
“To ask or to be asked?”
“Perfect. 
Now ask him in a steady rhythm, giving him time to respond with similar pacing. 
I’m gonna identify your various inflections, and try to tie it all into a recognizable riff that represents the synthesis of our three logics and naturalities.”
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
All forms of addiction stem from the ego clinging to a false reality, supplementing with altering substances when true reality threatens the ego veil.
All forms of true recovery stem from the self becoming aware of self and role within greater whole. 
This role discovery is true goal of dynamic self, but disabled by ego, which is static self.
Thus, recovery occurs when we differentiate between ego needs and true self needs.

Our obligation is to keep them entertained with dynamic relevant content.
My older brother was the good example,a nd I turned myself into a lefty to be like him. 
I didn’t quite make it to good example. 
Instead I chose the role of great demonstrator. 
And so,, dear smart people, here are 100 chapters, each an experience I sought and was changed by. 
I present it to you hereinthat you might experience it through me, and not risk your own sanity or social standing.
To confuse you further, some chapters are topic centered, pulling from various years, while others are one day or one mome nt. 
Each chapter has its own intro by now (hopefully) because in the last ten years I’ve written more intros than chapters, which I guess means my subject matter is more abstract than literal, and the intro is me clarifying my current set of goals, which changes almost daily. 
I attribute this to the system of learning I’ve developed that focuses on autonomous direction, creative expression therapy, comfort with cognitive dissonance, and a variety of stynesthesias and apophenias. 
Yes, I am using those words correctly.
The key I have found is cognitive dissonance. 
The goal is to ALWAYS be
Joyfully Discontent.
Joyful in the NOW with its perfect balance within its infinitude of seeming flaws.
Discontent with your present self when it is not adding to NOW’s perfection.

The following piece was written as a way to purge the negative thoughts that are fucking up the time I spend with the girl I'm currently dating. 
I need to continually remind myself that she is a new person that I don't fully know yet. 
Having dated girls who cheated on me and lied to me about doing drugs regularly, I have a hard time trusting girls, especially if they are going to a party or a show without me. 
Especially if they know alot of males. 
Especially if they're attractive and smart and kind. 
Especially if I like them. 
Even worse if I love them. 
If I was simply enjoying her presence I wouldn't really care, because she's amazing and improves my day and my life and I hope that I improve hers as well. 
But my fears and emotional trauma have risen to the point where I feel my output is absolute shit at times, and I don't want that to be what I offer her. 
I don't want to live on clues that make me assume something must be going on. 
She can read these things in my face, and will change topics and talk a bit quicker, and sometimes that makes it worse, because in the moment it feels crucial that I evaluate every aspect of our exchange. 
How does one calm down? How does one stand up? How does one reduce the frowns and make the dark thoughts stop? 
You are weak and pitiful with your emotional choices, always giving in to turmoil and discordant noises. 
Get up get out get on with it draw your lines. 
You have the right to make boundaries that you can't deal with. 
Trust is one thing, but asking someone to take extra measures to avoid your triggers is something that makes a relationship. 
If they can't do that than why the fuck would you offer all that you have and struggle to share your beliefs and bare your scars if they simply will continue to poke there and step there and trigger it?
Some of the feelings are as follows :
------------------------
That's not a business meeting that's not a childhood friend that's not a house mate. 
I'm not your permanent choice, I'm your summer fling. 
I'm not your perfect counterpart, i'm your flavor of the month. 
I'm not taking part in something real, I'm a toy in a grand scheme of falsehood. 
I can't tell the difference. 
I've developed a pattern of only attracting women who will cheat on me. 
I wouldn't be able to recognize truth and honesty and actual intimacy if I spent the rest of my life in it. 
There's no way to ever know and thus no way to ever safely trust. 
There's no one driving but you Mikey, and you are a fucking piece of shit driver who has shunned all that is holy and are only worthy of someone who can duplicate decency but truly lacks it in the core of their being. 
Its a farce a sham a build up to a break down. 
It started a mess with the avoidable sex map, it ends with an arrow labeled "this way to all your fears". 
Its not where you belong. 
Its an economic exchange. 
Faith is folly love is just foggy eyed lust. 
I can't do this I'm not strong enough I don't want to be hurt again. 
It took 3 years to care again this time. 
Next time I may never care again. 
I've never pursued the actual darkness, always flitting about on the edges, but the darkness reaches out to me and embraces me, and calls to me promising strength and self reliance. 
I don't miss people and I don't get lonely, and I don't need this and I don't need you and I don't want to fucking lose my shit. 
i don't want to build up to perfection only to have it shattered by the ruthless rearing up of human frailty. 
------------------------
I'm sorry for feeling these things. 
I assure you I don't believe them. 
They are the abusive teacher who should be locked up and burned alive. 
These are acid head feelings and the thoughts are his knife that he wields and waves at the passing pedestrians, assuring them that he knows exactly who God is and how to let him out of your insides. 
I don't know if I'm supposed to share these things. 
I know I need to process these things. 
I know it will continue to need addressing. 
Like shrapnel in my heart, a bullet in my brain, passing by your magnetism rips my aorta and makes me less than sane. 
So I beat on my chest hoping the shrapnel will settle back into its scar pocket, and I beat my head against the wall, hoping the bullet will fall back into the reptilian brain, and let the higher functions continue. 
I want faith. 
I want strength. 
I want you to be next to me for as long as possible, be that a month a year a decade or a century, our current parallel trajectory is the best news I've had in a decade. 
and I want to respect and cherish it properly. 
and that means putting these thoughts to sleep. 
Each time it's easier to get past it and to acknowledge whats fear and whats fucking idiotic assumption and what i feel I am allowed to relay. 
I'm shrinking these feelings, one day they'll be a haiku, and very soon these thoughts will be unrelated to you. 
Because I chose to trust you I chose to pursue becoming part of your life. 
i chose to risk it. 
It is a risk. 
I'm a coward and a child and I hope my shit storm isn't too much for you. 
 ot much fun, not what I want to share. 
But also not something I want to hide. 
This sad face means i'm struggling. 
It has nothing to do with you. 
I feel worse for inflicting you with my emotional residue.
Staple a smile to my face
Make it cynically safe
Warm and wet in the dark
In the places I bark
At the moon at the sky at the Gods and at life
It’s a way to be making it on through the strife
Just a mess that I found all the old ones are back
And I know it’s a trick I was born with the knack
To make clean seem false
To make true seem doomed
In the light of the day
In the dark of my room
It’s the only old ramble that wont go away
And its not mine to share I don’t want it to stay
So I hold it all in and I jot it all down
But the end of the day I feel like I may drown
So shrug off the thoughts and step out into the light
Let it all drop and don’t give in to past scars and frights
It’s a new glowing chance to reclaim your own life
And the fears that you cherish are nurturing spite
If we simply give in to the patterns we’ve made
And we see the old monsters that left us this way
We give death to the chances and sorrow to joys
That would otherwise build into angelic noise.
I can’t I can’t I don’t and I wont.
What I want may be not I’ve abandoned the boat
Is it burning or sinking or both in conjunction
I’ve lost my old ways I cannot find my function
Its only a head space its simply a thought
That can fall in or out it can thrive or just rot
Can it really be everything all that I wish?
Or is it like the last time, continually amiss?
Is your choice quite as strong as you wish that it were?
Can you muster the strength to no longer concur
With the sad angry voice that demands disbelief?
Am I caught in the cycle tween ecstasy and grief?
Would God send me another who isn’t quite there?
Can I manage to hang on while not splitting hairs?
Are the clues really there? Is there really a goal?
Am I waiting to find out I’ve broken my soul?
Does it ever run out or is this voice my only?
Bitch bastard fuck shit piss and yet still I’m lonely.
Can’t take too much mystery can’t wait in the wing
Wondering if it’s a reason excuse or a fling.
Don’t be holding me close don’t be giving me love
It’s a enough that you care but my visage is rough.
Can’t be won’t fester wound wouldn’t do that to you.
Its not all that I feel what I see isnt true.
To the choice to the map to the goal to the plan
It’s a question that tests one to tempt them to chance
I care again damn you, and up rise the goblins
That crouch in my skull broken crippled and hobbling.
But packed into pockets of muscular choice,
my trauma recedes at the sound of your voice.
My decision is you, and my struggle is past
I'll face it. 
I'll risk it. 
I want this to last. 
I cling to my life tree, no longer from fear, and only by choice.
She's given me a chance to believe, and to choose my type of noise. 
Less than cynical, less than spiteful, less than apathetic and self reliant.
Thank you for the chance to stand with you and against the darkness, defiant
So mister hulter. 
what have you learned from this ritual?
hat I feel like I don't deserve her. 
That I feel like I could be doing much better for her.
hat I feel like she doesn't deserve my pitiable cynicism. 
and have you made any decisions to change anything?
yes, I've decided that changing topics is much more functional than pursuing a purge, especially when the purge is a continual repetition, comprable to picking at a scab, making it impossible to heal. 
and will you be sharing this piece with her?
If she wants, but I feel like this needs to be the last one, because at this point I'm no longer gaining ground with this practice, rather just looping it, going through the entire trauma again. 
Even if I'm condemning and maligning the clues that lead nowhere, I'm still giving them attention. 
It will not shrink until I condemn it. 
It's come time to condemn my fears. 
She's right, I ought not think any of these thoughts. 
especially "I'm not worthy" lest I perpetuate my own disbelief and assumption that it wont last. 
because how could it last, how could it be the perfection that I see if I continually doubt and compromise it with false assumptions?

PREMISE
I'll bet chickens run so fast because they know that when you catch them you're gonna cut their heads off.
JUSTIFICATION
	"You see that young one there? Loko at that face. 
He looks too damned mart. 
Cunning. 
You gotta look stupid to survive."
"Mr. 
Nichols, You've survived here the longest. 
You've managed to escape the grasping arms of the farmer over two thousand times. 
Everyone here respects your opinion, especially concerning methods of avoidance. 
But looking stupid doesn't seem like a very convincing halcyon."
"You're thinkin too hard, boy. 
First of all, we are stupid. 
We're stuck in this cage of metal netting, chicken wire they call it. 
Somehow we're useless against it. 
At least once a week, we watch the farmer carry away one of our people. 
And when he comes we have no response except to scatter. 
The moment of scattering? This is no time to look cunning. 
The farmer will feel drawn to the smart looking ones. 
The dodging "Clever" ones. 
He will follow the logic of the clever, and intercept you at your next attempted avoidance. 
I am unpredictable in my consistency. 
I bug my eyes out and run straight at him, and do laps around him. 
"I've seen you in the field, Mr Nichols. 
And it's true. 
You look stupider than the rest of us combined. 
It's a wonder you can seem so competent and collected now."
"Years of Practice." Mr Nichols had seen alot of chickens come. 
Mr Nichols had seen alot ofchickens go. 
THe universe of Mr Nichols was limited to the twenty five foot long and wide chicken yard. 
He'd been there for a long time. 
He had been chased by three different farmers in his life, each the son of the last. 
Mr. 
Nichols wasn't avoiding death anymore. 
Simply the farmer's hands, as an instinctual reaction. 
No longer out of fear, but out of discipline. 
Several times he paused for half a second, in front of the farmer's clumpy gray boots, wondering if he should let himself be caught. 
Let a younger chicken live on for another month. 
But he never could. 
His body would fanatically drop back into his mechanical avoidance ritual of bugging out the eyes and running laps around the farmer.
The question of technique was all the chickens ever talked about. 
Almost everyone had a secret technique, ironically using false techniques when it really mattered, for fear that their secret technique might be stolen and copied. 
Most false techniques were well known and for the most part ignored, spoken of like the weather or a sports team;
"How's the old sudden pause than burst foreward technique woroking for ya?"
"Oh, still alive. 
Not much more though. 
You know, he got one of my tail feathers last time?"
"Oh, that's aweful!"
"Yeah, but I'm still here. 
How's your follow four steps behind the loudest chicken technique going?"
"Not bad, my ears are still ringing though."
"Understandably."
One technique that was far more successful than Mr Nichols was invented by one, Sonya. 
Sonya was a chicken who carried herself like royalty. 
She had a strange way of interacting with the universe. 
She would ask horrible strange, almost blasphemous questions during the night meetings on the roost. 
"Why don't we kill the farmer?" She asked one night. 
All side conversations fell silent, all eyes bugged out. 
She was perched in a shaft of moonlight, and all the other chickens stared down at her from the shadows." 
"Perhaps for one such as you this is possible, Sonya." Mr Nichols had said. 
"But as for the rest of us, it is not in us to do such a thing."
And in this moment her technique was born. 
Sonya nodded quetly to Mr NIchols and the metting went on, her technique slowly hatching in her tiny chicken head. 
Sonya knew that it would be impossible for her alone to kill the farmer. 
She knew as well that no other chicken would ever be like her. 
If she thought there might be a chicken comparable to Sonya, thanshe would not be sonya. 
And so she was accingpting of her solitudinous role. 
With this came a very solitary approach to sirvival, which was the reighning approach anyways.
The next day, the farmer came, his gray clumping boots crunched through the gravel by the gate, adn the chickens knew by the hour that this was the bad kind of feeding. 
Th kind where one chicken is fed... 
The whole yard kicked up into a squacking squabbling mess. 
Mr Nichols met him at the gate, and began rapid laps. 
In the middle of theyard, all the chidckens were frantically implementing their techniques. 
There were a dozen that were trying out the classic sudden stop turn right technique, and three or four were displaying obviously fake techniques which would be replaced (hopefully) by their real ones once the farmer was dangerously close. 
In the middle of the scurry stood sonya. 
Stock still, facing right at the farmer. 
She seemed to be asking him. 
She was summoning up all the peotry in her chicken breast, and presentinghim wiht the eqistential question, "WHy?" Her eyes screamed up at the farmer. 
"Where do we go>:" Her statuesque poise seemedd to demand. 
"Than what?" Her tiny motionless beak seemd on the erge of releasing.
And as the farmer approached, he looked down at her, and met her gaze.
She wept.
They found her the next morning dangling from the roost. 
She had hung herself.
.......................................................
How is it so easy for us to let our universe shrink
il we think of nothing but our personal plague
shirking all reminders of everything else
hat passes by the passive eyes stuck internalized
and contemplative of what is or seems
or looms in the mind view.
It seemed initially to be a normal saturday. 
My friends, a few of them, were off far way doing side work, clearing a landscape of debris, processing biproducts into useable thinggs. 
How long had I been there? When Ihad I returned was here or there for which I yearned? Or simply transience, calling to my itching heels? Called back once more by a feeling, a presence. 
One which once caused hesitance.... 
fear, paranoia. 
But boy let me tell you, life can glow. 
There's more out there than we'll ever know, only finding that nugget of truth love and joy when willfully we get cut off from the noise. 
While noise has its beauty, it's silence that shines. 
If frames in the present, im beds in our minds all the tiny perfections we miss every day as wee scurry and worryu along on our way to the next on the list, the penultimate task, always far too caught up to just sit back and bask in the warp of the day and the gglow uof our minds..
Rise up like the ocean! Respon to the moon disipate the false ways and unblock your mind room. 
Tis not for us to be chasing completion depleting our essence succumbing to defeat. 
LEave this unholy palce of hesitation and scrambles. 
Simply tell a short story you remember and leave out the rambling trail incoherent as a rattlers tail that ignites the evening with pensive shakes making soldiers and settlers all jump awake to make sure it's not their bed that's been compromised and with soft comfort thoughts once more down they lie. 
W
What farce. 
What quandry. 
What is this new game? Face your incompentence and exaqmine your pain. 
The debts that you feel, the curse you deserve, tyour inconstant flailing perpetual swerve. 
Cast off blot out shape up shift in lay back move on as the miracle begins. 
Caught agog at the thought this is all that I want not confronting replacement nor faking my thoughts. 
I got lucky again, or I've earned her wsweet grins. 
Her soft touch is too much it always makes me spin. 
and the laugh that she offers, the look in her ey3e emenating resiliance, life joy and the sky lookming over us both like the blanket that God tucked over the earth burheon grace for the flawed. 
12-6-15
purloin repurpose persuade and provoke all the onslaught the lot of it all bellow forth and the final fury of ever present incentive just
o test it on the jaws of a lesser God, pausing in hallways kicking at the shit piles left by those who left a week ago looking for another
place to do something more than just wait to die. 
after all, and before whats next it's much less and leering languidly from the couch in
he corner is the coroner, measuring bodies and brain cell counting and hoping for something more than just another series of indefatigable
irrepressible irreplaceable and purloined repurposed items persuaded to be something more than they once were on the back foot of the heel of every gum shoe this side of the park, not lost not dark, not lonely, not sad.
gargling gargoyle turmoil poaching the birds in your brain refraining from choral restraint, it's all the same, it's all the fury, the wind in the walking ways and cat burglar climbing freely up oaks and into windows only to be chased out by the bulldog of sanguinity, found perching in postmen's pockets, counting change and hope, holding ropes and chains to keep it all together long enough to drop another hot one right onto the dreaming pile of rubbish known as the american mass hysterical has my flow stopped or the water changed dropping spots, or is it really something more than i could ever understand, too grand to be what I had hoped might be reasonable and worthy of attention I can't spare any longer, rather wishing and hoping i could confine it all into a cardboard box, name it after something I used to love, and send it kicking along out the back window on to the screaming stretching arms of the freeway, only to be bashed and pushed and blistered and splintered into a thousand irrelevant fragments that can never more be stitched back together into some sort of understandable sequence. 
It's too late for that, she whispered, and held me close close enough to feel her blood flowing deep beneath her soft milky skin which i seem to be highly addicted to at this point. 
I want to write a bible reflecting on the act interrupts the occurrence, and we become left alone in a dark room again and again and again, time after time, line after line, its something you seem to return to boy, why is that? Did you grow up in a dark room? Were you scared as a child of dark rooms? Loneliness was obviously not something you dealt with often, being raised in a flock, and gang, a herd, a tribe, a whole bunch of ya. 
It's a bit off putting to consider what it might be symbolically or socially, and how it might end up affecting all of you psychologically further on down the road, but we are not here for that this one is for simply generating and pushing and forcing and making noise and words and flow and finding purpose in expressing something anything soon now today it's time. 
i give you permission to take that massive irrepressible emotional dump you've been putting off for ten years. 
Let it begin to rain down upon the unsuspecting citizens of this fair borough, often finding fault in commonly paired words, more often than not resenting myself for having to return to my common subject matter, depression, expression, processions of words walk happily around my head gazing into my eyes, poking fiery fingers into my ears, playfully prodding my nose with their own probuscus prodders, it's a broken capillary stained fingers and short breathed discussion you'll get from me at this point, and I will eat the bait, and consume the hook, and digest the line, and be pulled up and up by our overlord creatures known as the madness keepers, who leave psychedelic desserts for all of us waiting on windowsills and in boomers, hoping we might pluck and consume one that they might be able to haul us up by the throat and extract what little nourishment is left in the human soul, a long forgotten piece of relic that was once resilient and inter related, immersed, in nature, the bosom of god mother, whatever. 
it's neat outside. 
I don't like walls. 
I like sunshine. 
and the feel of dirt on the bare feet. 
I don't like what socks do to my feet nor what gloves do to my hands. 
I would go naked if I weren't annoyed by people looking at me. 
They constantly look, as if I were there for them to notice, as if I were trying to gain attention from them, from you, from everyone. 
i only want one person to look at me, and they know it because I constantly stare at them, even in their absence, I carry their electric homage in my pocket, their face right there below the numbers that represent the time, so that she is always what time it is. 
It's always her time. 
It's never been my time, but I always acted like it was, and so now this far down the path, this far off the trail, there's very little to be done about what's gone on and what's waiting in the future, and how the ball rolls, mossless, downhills, into next ideas, not your average understanding of how the gorilla shakes its mighty paws at the sky and hollers for a new princess to come carry his head away on a platter, too strong headed, too bull faced, too broken in all the most important places, the poor gorilla can't seem to be who it once was, and it's the same gorilla it always was. 
There was the one that was smaller than my head, and there was the raccoon, and there was also a dog, though that may have been bobbies, but I remember. 
The robot and the stairs, and the walk we went on so many years ago. 
how can thirty mean so much? How can the dark come on so heavily? Robin Williams had to quit drinking, and so it makes sense that I as well ought to give it a try. 
I'm scared I'm wimpy and I'm not sure but all those terms, all those words, all those phrases, the prayers of a sucker bastard bitch wimp ass hole who doesn't deserve the love of a beautiful smart loving amazing woman who glows so heavenly, goes on and on with me through day after day of new problems that I seem to cause somehow, through my own years of neglect years of anti-discipline, anti-self control. 
Effulgence, exorbitant, excessive absurdist mess laugh mess cry mess run, mess mess mess Mass holy of holies, hysteria. 
It' never stops until like the hypnotist said, until you open yourself up to someone else's suggestion. 
This is the only way anyone can change, to compromise the authority of the self, to give in and decide to no longer be autonomous, but subservient to the inputs and realities of someone else, someone right next to you who sings happily about the sun coming up again, and wakes up like a puppy, doing every thing but licking your face, and the linolium is cold, but it's not godless. 
And the upstairs is dark, but it's the furthest from miserable I've been in centuries. 
Oh how I recall the weathering storms and the bountiful masses of blue arching waves engulfing and dooming and capsizing vessels, as we all hold dear to our boots and cry out to the gods  "yes, this is how I chose to end up dying, I always knew it would be like this." and I don't believe I've chosen a way I want to die yet, such a powerful strong and hearty thing to do, decide that I will die like a lumberjack or a fisherman or a warrior or pumping concrete or writing a song. 
That's most likely it. 
I'll probably go the way of tiny tim and harpo marx, both struck with heart attacks while one was on a ukelele and the other was on a harp. 
Time after time, harp after harp, the doctors told him it would kill him if he continued to play the harp so intensely and animatedly. 
Who ever heard of a doctor warning you not to play the harp, because it might kill you? Well, sonny boy, welcome to the future. 
Welcome to the twenty first century. 
Though it did happen last century, so welcome to the twentieth. 
You're the twentieth kid who came in here today asking me what the coolest way to die is. 
I told the last kid it was the way the emperor died in star wars, being thrown into a giant electrical system and shocking and falling and heaving and glumping and moaning and down and down and down he fell, never even pausing and always the same silly bastard who couldn't figure out how to connect the words together, couldn't figure out who was in charge, couldn't figure out why we are meant to listen and sit quietly, couldn't figure out why it is we get jobs, and make small talk. 
 Just a fucking iconoclast, now that I think about it. 
Everything is wrong and borking and broken, and I'm gonna get a degree anyways, but have no idea how I'm gonna go about paying it off, because after all, it's the american fucking dream, and one day it'll all click, and I'll be able to talk in front of a crowd and edit a piece I've written, and there's nothing I can do about it until I change in some unpredictable way. 
It's not like I get to choose when and how I change. 
Does anyone really ??? OF COURSE you fucking moose, you meat ball, you corn tard, you broken person. 
You only see your own reflection when you look around, so everything is scared and broken, and sad. 
Why would you choose this set of phrases, this set of terms, this set of emotions? This tool belt of useless knick knack horse shit dog fly piss away the childhood, enter your early middle age with nothing more than a fly swatter you invented one time working on a farm in another life, another time, another place, another set of skills and hobbies and interests and goals and pursuits. 
Aint it been long enough yet for you to let go of the death grip you've got on your linguistic capacities? When did it become so hard? How did it trickle away into this unintelligible mess? Can't we find a way to make it work again? Pump some gut blood back into that old jalopy known as human potential and strap cardboard wings to your broken sciatica back and heft yourself out the third story of someone else's apartment building and sue the landlord when you break your neck, and sue the cardboard manufacturers for faulty materials, and sue the guys who make your meds because you forgot to take them that morning, and hat's why your brain got all sticky and ruined, like ice cream in the sun, this silly little sweater vest of a mood stabilizer isn't so hot when it's cold out, now is it? Is there anything else we can get you before marginalizing and demonizing and mocking you as you drag your broken body along the railroad tracks towards redemption? 
12-9-15
nO sense in getting caught up in conundrums unsolvable fog banks unholdable, wriggle tanks off in the whispery willow of thought speak we seem to be caught in the bleakness the waiting the mem'ries and failing to rise and survive we realize its our try that comes true or falls fase aims the noose for the cause that has brought us a grumbling stumbling halting the flow its a minor detail that we'll neer get back to unless its the one that we hinge on and hurry for, never the easy, not simple but sane, it's the center of all good and shrouded with pain. 
can't be forcing a smile nor demanding a kiss, it's a soft subtle dance and its wrought with rememberance. 
Can it still be where we had left it before, or is it all a game once again, and your brain wont hold any more jelly no trains no more funny stuff, lofting new paradigms, pausing old cot spots cougch drops wiggle room find a face inside yourself reflecting of the betterness we all can strive and hope to catch in simple unprescedented ways that shall never be goddamit. 
why do you care so much about the tiny silences? Why do they stretch on so long and awkward? Did I do something? Why the fuck tdo I care so much?! A slip of the tongue. 
someone got defensive, and now I feel like I'm expected to crawl up and hug the knees, but I can't bring myself to because I don't really realize anything specifically problematic. 
 mahurm harumph comes back the response, unguessably obvious, predictable and really not so fucking bad. 
build it up and get bothered by it, and than sit back and shut the fuck up and realize there's gonna be tiny frictions, moments of awkward pauses, and long stretchy silence,s and they will not kill either of you, nor even maim any part of your psyche or spirit, so buck the fuck up and embrace the woman who's just as invested and three times as joyful and unhindered by the dozen problems you seem to find hiding in all those dark corners of your mind. 
instead step out into the yard, find the sun or the clouds the sky or the weather, and invest your attentions into the literal occurrences, the sounds, and the smells and let it bring you back to that shared space, that common reality that is anything but common that is what the two of you find together and pull out of the ethers. 
find it all and raise it aloft, and pause not upon the rocky cliffs of tiny stupid details with lip jabber dip swagger wiggle bump fizzle your strange pausing shirking stumble ruckus that we cannot seem to fix or pause or pursue the higher ground like the polar bear who slowly over the course of several long lifetimes gives it all and finds it all and clings to life and love and finds the peak and the apex and another set of synonyms very similar to the last, said the author to his finger tips, who all looked up simultaneously and said "head not stop pause shift wiggle sway, and keep your whimperings at bay lest you wake the dragon of despondency or the raccoon of incompetence. 
Rise up and shine on the way you've been craving for so long, and worry not the lost time, worry not the proofs of past lives, live not in the shadow of some past failed lover, live not in the wake of your own neglected ambitions. 
live not in the shadow of those around you who got farther with less luck who fought braver with less strength, who pulled through and made it and are coaxing you along from the far shore, safe from the demons of the river styx, safe from the hellian hound pit of fury and faithful ignomonious absurdity. 
After all, don't we all need those moments, those feelings, those moods, and you've given your fair share, and now it's not your fault that you're stupid, but it seems to be the case,. 
you've forgotten the language of intimacy and shared psychology, and you want therapy, just like everybody, but you'r pride and arrogance keep youofrom finding it, fixing your function, pursuing pleasance and positivity and faith and functionality. 
All you have is all you need its love and give it up and cling to it, happily and faithfully, and not a drop of paranoia, choose wisely son. 
choose the track you set that there mind upon, and realize it's all you really control, so hold on to it like the flying burning death cattle of rodeo futures that will only ever bring you back to the same in a purified place, with more grace love and style. 
 Been awhile since the games were all playable lacking the stench of depravity, the curse of guilt, the pausing of awkward questionable first time forays into new worlds, places unguessable unchangeable unplunk unthroues, finilistic purloinery. 
it's all just aspects of your paranoias, odd regrettable flaunting the question, clinging to the doubts, cursing the demand for faith, what strange new generation I've not been prepared for, not so ready I could be ready i might be old and that might be the end of that gimmick, after all, who the fuck knows? it's not just a future we're talking about, it's all that you've ever wanted, and it's the creation of new levels of new mantras of new faiths and goals and beliefs and patterns, and that means we have to be leaving the dead and burning the broken, and laughing wildly and freely and happily along the rail, and even if it's just a slow series of modified repetitions, isn't that all it ever is? Aren't we just speeding up our usual mindset to get through more and more in time to rephrase and rewrite and modify and flaunt....

Never been so normal
so detached from all the turmoil
ever dissatisfied crying
o skies full of ghosts
It's the least I can do
it's the most that I've known
and it keeps getting easier
hardening joy choices
mostly its pausing
i'm eaten by thoughts
all infested with moths
i invested in death
with its wide eyed
soul rattling cough
hat will pull down your jaw line
and wrinkle your brow
so sorry for yawning
I can't seem to find
my controls and my normals
all thown out with mold
it's a cat call from god
and a wink from the devil
he field was leveled
by playing with fire
andnow we aspire
o rise a laugh
and fight for love
it's life.
Better every day
better problem better try
it gets better on your way
as long as we stay in the sky
it's always hard always a struggle
but no longer befuddlednow
we know what we might offer
how to act when to smile
we just fight the outer input
girimace grind and
put it behind us
after all we chose to be here
we love the face that pulled us up the grace
hat gave us pluch we love
and that will be enough
oh simple one word everything
enough to reboot and start anew
e nough to compell and cause change
and bring us back again heavy
with presence but light on the leaning
he need for a reason,
a readable clause
probable cause
we find problems even when
we don't want them we must
keep joy alighned and gratitude. 
You're out of practice.
You have caustic laughter.
Your witty banter
is lackluster cramp
can't it shift and wiggle again
itnto those glorious mornings
why do you cling to
he crux of the crisis?
The internal riots that
hold you down by a heel
o your temple. 
the mud
of your present condition
seeps in and clogs your ear.
you fear the light
you fear the stable
you fear the future
you fear beingg ab le
capable strong true sane
you've been cast out of outcast
and still you remain
pausing pensive causing senseless
misfit calculations as to why
it's best to simply give in and die.
echo shift shudder.
It's only you pulling similar antics
let it be, release your franticness.
I been rude rowdy and ruthless
now I feel toothless
I been lost lude and loopy
now my horns have gone droopy
It aint a battle it's a homestead
you tuouch my hand it heals my head.
I thank the lord
I can't go home again.

So how does it work? 
We either wait for inspiration to strike
and a piece springs fully formed from our forehead,
or we continue to dribble out bits and quarks each day 
until there's enough of them to burn
on a fire of the vain attempts to prompt something more than the usual? 
Or is the usual good enough? Or is thephrase good enough garbage? 
And how do we pick through afterwards,
like checking which socks are sticky,
which are hardened, which are clean
and ready to host an adventuresome wander gait
hrough the everlasting horizon always just beyond reach,
alwyast the next stop and the other plan and after this and not yet. 
So now a new experiment has begun,
a silly small experiment that feels like some sort off chopping of limbs
and compromising of self and saentience. 
I wonder what will come of it. 
Being booze free, I'm sure, has stabilized by my emotional content,
has reanimated my inquisitiveness, boosted my resilience,
but what will breath bring me,
now that I lack the poision that's been haunting me sfor so long? 
I do wonder I do fear I do worry I do want to get on with it
and find some way yto make time pass quickly so that i can adjust
and stop being stuck and caught up in the simple idea
hat I might only take a drag at a time today,
wo drags every two hours
making it a grand total of one cigarett etoday. 
Won't we be happy and proud and strong and fresh? 
Wont tomorrow e easier until I go visit the cloudy ones,
up on the hill across the canyon,
where the smoke sits thick like blankets and feathers
floating through the livingroom air,
shared by a common coughing semblance of sentience. 
Oh, this will be a grand adventure. 
All the paintings are still the same, done by the self same guy,
brought in to wide eyed spectators looking for soeething great,
and it's too late for you to catch up
and become the exquisite expressive dauchsund of demonic harmonies,
because you've spread yourself too think, you're a sheet of angel glass,
useless for anything except breaking as a demonstration
o teach others who might benefit from something entertaining to watch
something beatuiful to break, something deep and shuddering
o heft across the room at the face in the corner
hat tends to leer before it can ever come clear
and simply grin like the rest of em. 
and the asian guy washing his wheels, only moments after the rain. 
My goodness, what a brain it must be encased in that guy's calcium shaboogity. 
You can't predict em you can't read it on their sleeves,
hese creatures pacing and pawing around me likc e angel fish and crayon giraffes..
You really can't guess what's next or why you ought to car,e or what happens next,
or if anything is even working. 
It's perpetually unguessable. 
It's best left unmentioned. 
AFer all, who could ever care what it happens in the longg run. 
It's all just noise and games and toys and ways to play against the sky
for worthier pursuits worthier expanses heftier potentials. 
This will not be easy. 
Typing is not the anti drug. 
If it is, it'll have to be some random gibberish ticky meaningless tacky ramblings. 
So here we go again, unhindered by the curse of god taste,
unpausing due to other things that tend to get in the way. 
We will not tell, we will not show,
we will simply watch as the words tumble forth
and let them go into flow on and on a dn on. 
We shall never know. 
. 
After all, they all started out with shit in their heads,
shouts in their beds, broken stains in their teeth and dreams,
and none of them ever knew what it menas,
hey pulled forth meaning from nowhere and claimed it as true,
never wondering whether it was true. 
How can we live like this? 
Are we still human? I don't recall ever caring so little or wanting so badly to have something change. 
AND BAM!!!! There it is. 
Something changed.
It became for just a fraction of a second a different town. 
Or perhaps I saw it through fresh eyes. 
 ot mine. 
This was a brown building across from a white stucco thing,
and it all was so quaint and unfamiliar. 
I wonder how many times I've seen it as such blasted on salvia or nitrous oxide,
and what will happen when I finally let my brain heal,
if I don't just crumple into infamy and empty dreams
about the feeling of a fresh sheet or the smell of hot chocolate. 
It's hard to guess what happens next,
one sip of coffee has been a test,
and it takes a mimute for it to start the flow,
and it hesitates, but so it goes,
as we all prepare for the next rumble through
In hopes that this time it will carry something new
or true or poignant or perhaps profound
or leeringly luubrious, simpleton frowns.
caustic bombastic rattleing drastic
irrelevancies across hypnotic carpets
its more than I'm ready to crawl throughg again
it's not mine its not yours its all a barge
hrough forest logic into further onslaughts of unguesable chaos. 
He's got a knack. 
A white knuckle rattle path
always the simmering shitular. 
Never the shamed It's a penchant for perpetual puberty
keeping him waterlogged and less than purified.
Oh what an uncommon devisive remonstrace of perception.
Can't be left guessing in this unpallatable town. 
How can maybery seem so dreary,
caught amidst windstorms of tumult and fury,
how can the weather bring in such irreverence
and when will the pausery be filled with pleasance?
It's all just a game now, to see how much longer
we sit and we wait for the cigarette stronger
we grow as the hours go by,
but it's been twenty minutes
and fire is mine
o be rising and rolling
and hep hooey sheeeya,
can't blank out the stake out c
can't call in the draft.
it's all part of the system the rhythm the flowchart
compell me to misery mudin the dark.
call the sky down and summon the fotg wind and noise
and come tell me the truth about underfed boys.
can't we all just rumble throughg,
is every thing stil lcaught on you?
can we be freee oh some day soon,
or is ther only never moon.
I drip out my hopes
and they land in a jar
and it gets packaged up before
I send it off so far
o be equated up and counted down and
sifted through and covered round
with ribbons linens fur and feathers
up on shelf tops caught forever
where would we be without you
and where would it all go to prove
it's not a stream of gibberish
except you fucking prick, it is!
When did the words leave me?" Theo James called out into the lava flow. 
They'd given him tenure, and he had brought the girl he was in love with, but even on the beaches of hawaii, even overlooking the lava flow, even here in the most rare of paridises, he couldn't manage to get a fucking boner.
He was furious with himself, and had accidentally blamed her, quickly apoligizing and making int clear that he knew it was because he had been smoking chains for twelve years, and she had no part of his fucking crippledness. 
The worst part was her refusal to accept oral as a substitution. 
How does a male get past this sligght and tormentious complication? This is not something that just goes away. 
In fact, the problem was it had just gone away. 
He was tempted to ask if she wanted to try watching porn. 
He had already asked her to go down on him and see if that fixed it,
But she had poked at it like road kill and given a couple lack luster brushes with her mouth, as if it were salted with vineager. 
Perhaps it was. 
He couldn't be sure. 
Just cause he was sober didn't mean he was sane. 
Just cause he was standing there didn't mean he knew anything. 
But WHY WHY WHY?!?! What kind of cruel luseless God would take such a crucial element of humanity away from one such as he? Poor damned Theo James. 
And this our famous favorite alchoholic self destructive wretch of a wreck, we all know that he probably deserves it,
hough if you keep rewinding you see that his current version of self was prompted by trauma that he probably didn't deserve, and his alcoholism had started after his loss of God which was totally natural at the time, and only now, twelve years later, did his chainsmoking binge drinking bonerless life
start to seem like he may have brought it upon himself, which he HADN"T!!! SHUT UP SHUT UP!! He shouted down the craggy cliff into the lava flow . 
The cave they were in was luminescent in a very hellish sort of redness. 
He felt a satisfying burn in his stomach, as if he were supposed to be cruel now.
This was very unusual for him, because he was generally the sweetest most reasonable sane balanced person around. 
He halways had some quip to diffuse any sort of friction. 
He always had a piece of candy in his pocket to give to the child who was misbehaving, or the recovering heroin addict who
was starting to itch. 
Mister James looked out on the lava and let himself fall silent, no longer screaming wildly at the fire. 
No longer filled wit his outrageious ire, finally at peace once again, quietly accepting this fucking hilairous tidbit of comedy that God had seen fit to drop on him./
Mister James was a realist, and he knew that he had neglected to check up on his own fucking lifestyle and capacities, and he knew it was running thin, and he only had so long before he was back in the mess, back in the tunnel, back in the caveyard graveyard bastard bitch barbecue spot where he had first gone off that good old deep end, that bright purple shimmering fit of ecstatic fury that sent him sizzling off to oregon to lick his wounds and sleep on hillsides and wander through meadows in the light of the moon while oak trees danced majestically overhead, waving arms and legs and limbs at him as if to say "hey, you fucked up. 
Hey, you're waaaay far from home. 
Heeey, fuck off." And he took these oak tree messages to his heart, and he carved them into his subconscious mind, and he never let them leave. 
He was not one to give in, he was not one to give up. 
He only took on projects and plans he knew would destroy him, and this was beginning to look alot like one of those. 
Even Hawaii had brought him back to the same fucking circle world of repetitive predictable absurdist messery. 
Anya paced the floor of the hotel room, all decked out in bamboo and whispy linens. 
It was a surreal set of experiences and she wasn't ready to give in. 
Poor Teddy, never ready for such problems as this, always full of fury and pep, not the type to go tepid mid stream. 
Not the type to wimp out and go ... 
soft. 
She didn't even like saying it. 
She felt like a moose, pointing fingers, producing shootable fish, the barrel being somewhere between his and her thighs. 
They weren't really as broken as all that, he was just frustrated and had run off along the beach towards lava cave, and she had decided he needed his privacy. 
After all, men need to feel like men, and getting boners is something men do. 
To fail at such a task is a very serious and problematic thing. 
She quickly decided to never mock him for being older than her again. 
It was either getting to him, or ironically relevant. 
Fucking cigarettes. 
That's simply bizarre and unruly. 
Disaster zone is the term I'm looking for. 
How could such a simple shift biscuit slipper mystical fink of wretched frustration. 
This is not where art comes from. 
I need the rain.
I need a walk,
anand an and
where to from here? Is there any more we can do? Go finish the pile of tiny work up at the cloud house,
wait for tomorrow when monday might bring work but more likely won't
or perhaps we can put pressure on the possibilites, and prompt what we deem to be ultimate necessity. 
Does this count as pages? Does this count as words?
Releasing these feelings like rusty cage birds?
Can it all be so normal will we ever sleep
or are we caught in turmoil ever too deep?
simply simmer on into the wintery window
and give in your charming old shiftery grin glow.
I'm not here for you and you're not here for me
but we manage to set each our others faree.

every once in a while I get the feeling that I'm being drawn. 
Not along a path, not towards something, but drawn is in jotted down by a strangers pen, staining their paper facade to properly relay edges and shadows to properly relay what they find determines what amounts to me. 
It's a bit of a bashful feeling that makes me both quiver and shrink while leaning forward and trying not to smile and working desperately to keep from thinking, but it's the human condition the usual game, the penultimate experience of God's own game of pride shame game wish walk in, turn around, check your pockets, hope someone slipped in their phone number or told you where to go next, perhaps a job, because you look resilient, hopefully not, but hopefully so. 
forever sabotaging and not quite wanting the same thing from one moment to the next. 
perhaps I can encase my ambitions in concrete, tattoo them on me so that I won't be allowed to let them trickle out into other irrelevant facts and facets and capacities and hopes and dreams. 
Perhaps a slowing agent, molasses of the mind, something to keep the thoughts so simple and slow I won't be able to look up until long after the goal has passed and I've fallen in with a whole new set of ambitions young strange bearded gentlemen with worried eyes and phones permanently pressed to their sweaty ears, perhaps talking to an investor, perhaps just talking to ma or pop for another personal loan to cover loan payments for another week or month til I 'm back on my feet again, because these days it's a carpet on a roller coaster, never the stillness, never the predictableness, always shifting and sweeping the legs, instead of being swept, we've become slaves to our systems, no longer using them as we see fit, but being used and cogging it up and falling in like soldier bears, happy smiley, shiny new shoes, all my buttons done, how bout you? I see you've got a golden gun this time, mine is only yellow. 
I'm not sure why. 
were you related to some up and up? That's how these things usually work. 
A rope is dropped from the upper balcony and you're free to shimmy up the length of it in order to ascertain a view a goal a use for all that you've managed to bring and hold and cling to like a child. 
It's not easy being anything besides what we were born into, and even that ends up causing rashes on the inner mind, and the soul. 
It's just another tumult just another series of useless bruises, and it seems perhaps I was wrong about being drawn. 
perhaps I was simply going downhill because it's ever so slightly easier, and now here we are at the pit of the canyon, where all the springs trickle in, and there's no way to know if it's safe anymore, because checking on seventeen springs for any complications is much more than any small sampling of whatnot can take. 
It's a troubadour view of artistic inclination, a few similar brains have been seen in this space. 
Not predictable, not wanted, not even having much more of a point than to keep the fingers and mind busy enough to get through this damned day without smoking more than one or perhaps two if i'm good, cigarettes. 
 icotine. 
The old upper modificator, makes the brain find pace and pattern quicker than anything. 
Caffience. 
it doesn't quite do it alone. 
It brings the mind up, but the pants are too big. 
 icotine is the belt so that the head can remain up there, all cloudless not so baggy. 
I'm baggy brained at the moment, some sort of charlie chaplin antics dancing like muffins in the corners of my brain. 
it all seems predictable and stale, but only because it's the parts of my brain that are far too available, and the goal is to stretch and to push and to find new edges and to bust into flows that we haven't had access to without all the doses, and it gets quicker and easier as we push harder and less upheavals, fewer pausings, not so much of a chance, this is rugby, not football. 
We don't stop every 10 seconds for a 30 second break. 
We break into a fury like soccer players, constant and unrelenting, hounding the ball across the green field, glistening chlorophyll surface of unkillable stomp lawn, how can the grass be so resilient, like a head space that refuses to give in. 
It's not natural, or perhaps death is not natural. 
Perhaps the perpetuity of grass is closer to reality than any of us have ever realized. 
Perhaps we are finally becoming a species that can understand this, and is willing to get stomped on by the ignorance of the masses that the rest of the masses might realize and give it a rest. 
Will it really all come crashing down? Is this emerald phase simply waiting for something to melt us all into gods ignominy? Are these words just the ashes being scattered into atmospheres starting on hearth and being blasted beyond the here, outside of the now, into infinitudes of tiny meteor showers, falling all directions, remaining insurrection un compromising, unpredictable, heretoforunbeknownst to man, and all that other wonderful gibberish. 
Perhaps it's almost time to wrap this rap up and stumble off with itchy fingers, waiting for a good reason to get going, a good way to get started, a good ness to be better than. 
 something to aspire to besides economic competence, besides sequal function besides sobriety and sanity and familiial intermeshedness. 
Something to aspire to besides that old iconoclast spirit that still wells up inside of me like a muddy old faithful spewing monster, so ready and full of shit, waiting for a chance to spit bile and bucolic bull shitteruy across landscapes that were never meant for me. 
Human landscapes of potential and hope, waiting to jump ship and shimmy down the rope . 
It's all a matter of time before we're all in the same brine, pickling on through infinity, the good ship vineger, for who can resist the inevitable need to be stronger and safer and more calloused and ready for the nonsense and harshness and critical cursing of acclaim for things which we would never accept the blame? 
Blank stare, let it all just hang there. 
It's all be lost in the glare, don't shimmer or blush, don't shine or rush to seem all right. 
you're not and never will be. 
I may be the next one I may have the words that people finally feel and realize will help their hurt. 
But than again I could be just another dog bastard shit house failure flailing into the after life like a caterwhaling goofy who took too many steps off the cliff after wiley coyote to go smashing down auburn canyon walls. 
Aint it a stinky bit of rubbish that comes clawing out of your face when you finally thought it was getting easier and things were starting to make sense? It's not easy to realize you've been cheating on your brain this whole time. 
It's not fun to rewind and analyze the fact that every time you've ever written you've been either drunk or high, sometimes just hung over, sometimes nicotine and jave, sometimes all four, sometimes more. 
Always some stupid fucking trigger to weaken your capacity to simply do this things of your own accord. 
And you pause and wonder how these folks might feel if they realized what you were doing, just jotting and hemming and hawing and hoping it might come out stronger and post-rubbish post-shit all meaningful ruthlessly real, applicable to anyone with feelings, and no and yes and wait and I'm not who i thought I was. 
You sit there with your grin, which doesn't seem to ever complete itself. 
You sit there with your grimace so strong and confident perched on your facial shelf. 
You sit there with your coffee on your table with its wood grain, and you check your battery, suddenly worried that you might lose this massive pile of human waste in the form of jibbering words jittery turd noises, tumult is glorious, smells oh so sweet and specific come wafting past noses upturned and malignant, uncaring unspeaking, unchecked by the radar we seem to be far from our origins, far from our comfort zone, far from our chance to be more than what we've always know. 
It's all just a canon ball that crashes in through the ceiling, and leaves us oh so wine soaked poets a reeeling in the aftermath of the onslaught of celestial invasion, immersed in the attempt to unravel the cave noise echoing in and out of our blathering sensibilities. 
How can we ever get to somewhere high enough and clear enough to see what's actually going on? is this a real rewrite? Will it cleanse my psyche? Oh, lord. 
Oh shit. 
let's get this over with. 
It's time to get back outside and feel the sun before it decides to disappear and leave felton sleepy and cold, crowded and always growing more crowded and less old. 
 Oh, why do they make it less old?

ime to tilt down the lid ignore spacing and spelling and cohesion and neglect the onslaught of constant repititions, immersed in the usual jelly of self expression that we strive so consistently to free ourselves of our won paterns find the new edge the new path the new adjective and voice our frustrations with the self same personage that hides behind the eyes, lurks in the thickness of our things staying high on thoughts that pause and clump out like logs or chocolate feet that keep us breathing less than easily gasping for a texture that isn't tan, a lecture that isn't ransacked for pausing purposeless future falling flail pain few can be sure of what they mean and how they hope to make it clear, but if the only goal is to break the words out of the cryptic metal box of brain skull draining the snake of human self awarness into a world of simple explanations, like the curly footed glass topped coffee table in the coffee shop which once again has that same old black and whit tile floor, just like all true american spots where we come to pause and dump out our over roasted half cooked visions of something quite different, up rabbit trains and down back roads to find a summit in the foot of a canyon, the knees breaking from windy chill factor that came from some factory that we can't quite abide by calling our own, even though it would pay for the grand epic worthy home, its always something not quite perfect, built by slaves like our shoes and laces and chairs and upholstered with the skin of slaves in a distant snowy sand pit of shifty shelterless home free farblown naught to be returning to but our own infidelity and finding nothing more than what we left when we were but a child of five scampering along hot streets of sun heated asphault our soles cracking, our curled toes splitting open, til we learned to walk without flexing our toes over into footy fists, like a bit of a paraplegic monkey, clinging to branches far above our yard where our little brother had fallen and split his head open gushing out thoughts we weren't ready to see, showing spots in our future our past and the dinner we refused to finish because we sneezed in the salad and the lid fell off the salt and doused it all in far too much flavor leaving us numb to the subtle perfection of a potato, now simply the dull brainless starch of something not fancy enough, not cheesy enough, not saturated in taste, not suffocating in flavor, just a sunset and a walk and a hike and a new bike that meant we could get further quicker, find new edges, expand our horizons, now we hope to go to paris by summer, and denmark by fall, and never again to look back and wonder how it all came about because now it's become inevitable, this slow upward ascension, only slowing because we continue to look back, lots wife, saturated with salt, all but nothing more, the msg of self propelled wisdom that gets us nowhere but more comfortable on our ever expanding asses, not jamming, not laughing as much as we once were the constant source of jokes and hopes and floating through the room unaware that other people felt other things, always only thinking they were running along behind us hoping to also catch the free ride on the back of the buggy, whipping through the trees like the breath of the sky, gods wind, laughing into the cacophany of not knowing anything except what we decided ought to be, and beyond that having more than we could ever hope for in the form of potential and skill and shifting into new skid mark sand blasted burl stains that get us further along like a trickling rabbit house that falls down the mountain every time the soil turns around to check if its pants still have the tag, always laughing, always seeming happy, never sure if we were manic or truly satisfied, always never neither more than that same confident stride towards the other side, whether we were going dark to light or standing tween them, holding each in either hand, the goat the sheep, the breathing wolf of fate and inevitable whimpering...
heres always a fukin problem, and in the end the only thing to be done is find what momentum there is and use that enrgy and aggresiont o redirect the energy and redefine the emotion and find somewhere worthy and worthwhile to emerge from on the other side where wee might find a better path a better way a new joy, the same old toys through new eyes in ways that blossom and glow with all the hope and potentioal that we always knew it had and find again that same glowing field where we first discovered our faith in betterness, our pursuit of positivity, our potential for manifesting all that we hope for the world, all that we hope for everything ever, and in the end all we can do is find time and space to let things fall aawy, to let the gray colors fade and paint in our own new modified pallet of colors and clow glow shine and shimmer and ignore the weak smile and the shifty glance and find a reason to dance and a way to sing again, and not let it get to you that she isn't as happy as she was before she took lunch break with you, because you're doing better, the two of you rgrew and shifted and created universes that no one else has ever been privy to, and if she sees me as sad and I see her as avoiding me,a nd we both can't seem to keep on the same channel longe nough to breath together, to find that new upsurge past the weather to the top of the hillside where we can taste god on our lips and feel him in our lungs as we bask in the glory and revel in the presence of the divine which we've finally manifested and caused to emerge and shimmer in glowing grays on the tan wall of humanity that we can't seem to escape, because we need the hnegative to accentuate the positive, and we need the silence to accentuate the noise, clarify that is, this is what we wanted, this is how we get there, it's never easy there's mud and falling rocks and shifting desert sands and a river that continues crawlinng along looking for a nook to flood and a crick to brood in, which isn't as easy as we once thought, because the low energy flame diminishes, and we don't know how to get back in, because when the door is locked there is no spock to hold up a shifting hand, a listliss limp wrist bashful at the fat headed bastards who taught us to give in and slump down adn drunk iup and find a flowing flaw that causes our maw to close around the broken glass that slipped in to the ice cream without our noticing, because we were too busy watching the sunset and waiting for the starts to come out, and starting falsely, pausing immersed in thougghts that were never ours to begin with, always on the wrong, always in trouble, always looking for a way to escape the walls or the car, redefine our trajectory, ggain prescedence, choose explode and find a new flow that doesn't lead back to the things we were doomed to be told that we were doomed to pursue, to be lost in the falling flailing mist of mystic manstery, fate is not a game, and the future is not for you alone, nor is it the only way back to heaven, for heaven resides in this very place, in a blue room upstairs, where the heater never quite reaches but is not needed because two bodies will heat the place quicker than a candle and a tank of gas, its all just a laghing stock of caustic shock, not blotted out by cynical doubt, not pasuing at cliffside faces wondering if there's another way down instead launching out on the wings of that same old cheesy love song that keeps us dancing, keeps us awake, keeps us pacing and pursuing and hoping and chancing and knowing that it's better and tomorrow isnew, and there's something more on the curb in the residue, haltingly shot through with swiss cheese fate that leaves us drifting limp and broken like kerouac on his big sur cliffside singing back to the sea, the nosnense warbles, the gibberish whimpering the sun cascading down through the rain to meet us halfway between the faucet and the drain, yearning for yonder ponderances, pausing with hopeful breath caught in our throat, seeing throughg the leafless trees, feeling the hope that is stronger than anyone doubting anythingg, knowing that the only way to a beter self is belief, and the only way to counteract anyone elses input is to simply discount it and find a way to prove the opposite, not even that, because attempting to prove something is admitting its possibility, rather ifnding outside inputs, colors and shapes, characters and creatures, plot lines and paradigms that speak volumes about how we've chosen to see percieving a world that gives us all the enrgy and joy that anyone could possibly endure in this world awash with overblown sentiments, immersed in uncontrollable irrelevancies, locked in that same old dark mind room, finally a long droawn out thingg of thae past that we can pass by and laugh lack luster, but how do we keep from reacting? How do we avoid being offended,when we care so deeply about how we affect them, and what they are left with Are we faking all the tests, always ending up however we hope to seem, be it depressed or cursed or joyful or posessed? Are we nothing more than the jibberin babbling word river of God's unstoppable creek of human thought that was never meant to go this far, never meant to find this much, now far too saturated in an excess of expression, the library of babel, unable to sort through the tumult, incapable of seeking out the relevant, the sane, the true, rather finding things that match, things that carry the yellow and the blue, where for what yon, when shall we be what we thought we were? And how inevitable can it all really be when its just another long line wiathing for a turn at not seeming broken, not feeling wrong, not tolerating someone elses's insulting definitions? No use for this depression, no use for this lack of gumptionn, no direction in this lump of insurection, just a jibber jabber slap it on thick with lather, frosted with haughty self rightoues intellectualism, finding another book thatt might hold the key, another lock that might know what I mean, another dance that carries all the romance we hoped we had inside of us the whole time, more exercise, fewer vices, no starch, no mean, no guts no glory, no moldy messy word choices, just a shift just anohter shift, another step towards the perpetual change that will always lead us to that same pause that same shift in unhappy not quite what we thought, waiting for the other shoe to drop, almost positive it's on the back burner, always ready to accept the fact the fate the future that will eave us alone and send us skittering off to another town, another game another batch of friends and philosophies and chouseches and eating habits and potentials for disaster and prophetic shabby old pros who never knew what they were doing in the first place, simply realigningg themselves to better defend the position they always held to start with. 
Give int a swift kick and kiss the sky \, just momentum and energy that you will very soon be modifying with your editing hand, but find a way to at least have the option of the upper hand, instead of shrinking and shirking your capacity to actually denyl things that aren't going on, proove that proof is irrelevant and the response ins hnot what you meant to cause, and there never was a hole in the foloor or a pummeling tumult of snow from the sky, forever wandering by wondering if its really time, or if it's just alot of jibbery jabbery flapadoo cooped up in a reality that you don't quite steer, but it's better than where you were last year, now it's something better, now its something glowing adn fruitful, now its something you might want to carry with you throughg this christimas into next year, ont into the thirties, past prohibitionn, giving woment he right to vote, finding a way to stop the caustic plunking of coinns into a fountain that never reaelly broke through the mask into how we hoped we could end up. 
just a lack luster bastad with too many blisters and not enough gumptionn to fix the grimplings of history. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The sun seemed immensely hesitant to breast the shallow valley walls, as if it too were sleepy and far too comfortable in its cushiony bed of deep space. 
The bleak foggy atmosphere laying upon the dewy meadow grass was aglow with the thought of illumination, but the landscape remained passive and serene. 
A fox trotted along the vacant dirt road that meandered through the shimmering valley. 
He paused at a fallen log and nosed at something unspecified, exploring a scent that left him still hungry and pensive. 
The distant twinkle of bird noises began to rustle the frozen soundscape as the fox returned off through the field to its burrow beneath the redwoods.
All at once the serenity was shattered as Charles the Bard came barreling down the soft hillside riding his zip zinger dirt bike. 
The braaaapping and crunching of the engine was paired with his deep bellowing voice hollering out a song that nobody knew but Charles, and even he was unaware of what might come out of his mouth next, simply channeling the flow of his present experience, allowing the sounds of his steed conflicting with the setting to prompt in him a nonsensical jargon that simply represented his enthusiasm to continue existing and vibrating and burning.
“Can we claim to be more than the little we were
When we fell from the sky and landed in fury
Of life as it calls as the shimmering fate
That we cannot rely on nor fear it nor hate
It’s the only one way that we dance in the sky
In the face of the future the shine of the wind
It’s the only old wander we ought not begin
Been too long now to fight on too fateful to shirk
In the long run the short stick the builder the work
Can we never be shifting to things that we force
Feign the breath bring the shape take the gumption create!”
Down the dirt road, past the meadow, into the overarching redwood trees Charles went, hollering nonsense, laughing to himself at certain word choices and sound patterns. 
This was his morning ritual: to shatter the stillness with his enthusiasms. 
To assault the peacefulness with his maniacal joy.
Charles the Bard didn’t give a shit.

Wilson Goes for a Drive
“Matilda!!! Where’s the car wax?” Wilson hollered from the bathroom of the dilapidated double wide.
“It’s on top of the mirror cabinet!” She squealed back. 
“And don’t use it on your horns!! They look disturbing enough without you glorifying them with shimmer!” Matilda continued stirring the thick black beany goop she cooked five nights a week. 
After all, working at a bean factory as head bean counter had its benefits such as infinite bean supply. 
Wilson didn’t mind beans 5 nights a week, but he had become rather irate at her treatment of his horns. 
He considered them a gift from God, as if he were some sort of new age manifestation of Pan, or Abraxas, but she treated them as if they were some sort of curse.
Wilson’s Cutaneous growths had been a topic of much concern to his parents during his youth, and as an adult he had often sported a pompadour so as to minimize their presence, but once he had secured Matilda as his life mate, he had become more lax in letting them poke through, occasionally even slicking his hair back and shining his horns so as to haunt the neighborhood with his bizarre gift.
They weren’t massive, only poking a conservative 3 inches up, curling gently back like a mule deer. 
Nothing quite so fancy as the legendary Jackalope. 
He often walked downtown right through soap box square in Gamlar park, simply to watch the self appointed preachers lose their shit, suddenly stopping mid holler, staring agape. 
Occasionally he’d pass one who would quickly launch into a new torrent of world abuse, using Wilson as the central demonstration of the decline of human morality. 
Wilson would listen with a tight lipped smile and feel his stomach curl into the density and power of a black hole. 
These fools. 
What do they know? Flaunting ancient superstitions to provoke mass hysteria amongst the commoners, too busy doing the hamster dance to consider what sort of belief system their very lives demonstrated.
Wilson held the shammy with a soft grip and dipped it gently into the wax, letting his eyes lay across the bright red surface of his RX7. 
His flying squirrel. 
Same car since he had started dating Matilda who had affectionately named it Rocky, unaware that Rocky was a gray squirrel, only interested in the flying reference. 
Wilson had ceded the point, happy to have a mate who would take part in his life, going so far as to name his conveyance. 
Rocky had been on many a voyage, and Wilson had always been a cautious and caring companion to his car, coming home several times with pictures of it perched on romantic rocky cliffs he had visited while Matilda stayed home painting ceramic figurines. 
Their house had become filled wall to wall with dozens and dozens of tiny shelves, all attached to the wall, all occupied by armies of miniatures. 
The foyer and living room and bathroom and guest bedroom were all inhabited by over a thousand tiny furry animal creatures, all cutesy and bizarre, wearing old English hats and boots, holding shovels and pushing plows.
Wilson didn’t mind the experience of living in some sort of lilliputian museum, in fact he was glad that his wife had something so intricate and cute to keep her busy while he was out pondering the purpose of his horns. 
He didn’t accept anyone else’s maligning of his growths, but he harbored a wonderment as to what purpose they might end up serving. 
The biggest fight they had ever gotten into was when Matilda had brought home a file big enough to grind his gift down to nubbins. 
He was shocked and offended at her suggestion of cutaneous castration, and had been very clear to her as to who or what might leave his life first, her or the horns.
Today, he planned on taking a spin along Ridge road, to the canyon that led up past several springs to Summit, where he would sit and stroke his shiny horns, and holler wildly at anyone who drove past, letting out his inner banshee… He found this a soothing practice to keep his bizarre fixation in check. 
He was here, he felt, to startle the commoners. 
To bring discomfort to those who had let themselves become stagnant and cyclical. 
He felt compelled to live out his bizarre craving for a startling role. 
He got in his car, and slicked his hair back, and worked a little of the wax into his crustacean enigmas, or whatever. 
Than he got into his shiny red RX 7 and sped off towards Ridge Road and beyond.
Wilson was not afraid of divine retribution.

Papa Charles Plans a Riot
The boys had been drinking since last whistle, starting in the parking lot with their lunchbox bottles, and Papa Charles had quietly sipped on his pocket flask while they slowly turned the evening into a full on over charged whip rigged rally about how to get their well deserved pay for the two thousand chairs and 300 tables and 500 mantle pieces they had made which had caused the callouses and muscles to appear on their forms which would now soon be turned towards causing a storm to remind all the powers that be what full power there seethed in the bosom of all of their greed. 
The night had been chosen according to astrology, old Gypsy Fingers had been summoned in to decide when the best day within the next month might be for overturning the powers that be.
He had said next Wednesday would function quite nicely, and didn’t bother to tell them it was ‘cause his new dinette set was due to arrive on Monday, and they were usually late, so he gave the delivery crew an extra day to extract his purchase before starting some sort of hedonistic riot to demonstrate worker frustration with not getting paid.
“They have a cafeteria.” Cried Meek Joe in a flurry of drunken gesticulations. 
“We get free food! You wanna just walk away from that as if it doesn’t feed you?!?!”
“We are not dogs to accept simply food.” Replied Papa Charles, now slightly enthused. 
He had finished his flask and than had it refilled by young willy the bartender, a tousled blonde dude whom the workers had watched grow from child of four, son of Big Bart the Log Splitter who lived out near Jude, the town on the far side of Summit hill, up on the mountain where only the lonely and lost tend to go.
“I bring home my leftovers to my wife, and we don’t have a child yet, so we manage to survive on just the cafeteria food. 
I can’t just compromise my wife’s meals because you want to prove we’re not afraid. 
We ARE afraid!! Can’t you see that?!”
“Silence Meek Joe! It is no for you to say. 
We have demonstrated the two sides of the problem, and it’s left to the workers to decide.” Papa Charles raised his hands and spread them like Moses. 
“Who among you is unwilling to risk the meager benefits that we manage to eek out from this brutish Pewterschmidt, and this pompous Bierbach?! Let them leave now, and protect their pitiful wages.” Papa Charles paused and peered aggressively into the audience, dismantling the psychology of each man, pausing long enough to give them a brief flash of approval. 
After an elongated stretching infinite pausingly painful fifteen seconds, Papa Charles spoke once more. 
“And who among you is ready to rally and force our new-found awareness upon those who have fallen into luxurious excess at our expense? And who is ready to risk! To risk and to taunt and to prove and to demonstrate?! Who among you?!?! Who among you?!?!”
The whiskey had finally taken over for Papa Charles.

Franky Goes to Jail
Franky hated hot dogs. 
He hated cafeteria eggs. 
Franky hated most of the food they forced on him at the P & B Penal Farm. 
He hated most things about the place. 
He had already burned the place down once, and was known and respected throughout the prison as the saboteur du monde, and this was one of his few joys. 
People gave him their deserts, simply because he was saboteur du monde. 
People gave him cigarettes in the yard. 
Simply because he was who he was. 
Ironically, he was falsely accused and had never burned anything down, but after 10 years of denying it, he had given it up and settled into the various perks of being known as saboteur du monde.
His time was almost up. 
It had been 40 years for aggravated arson, inciting a riot, and punching a cop. 
He had been 19 at the time, and was planning on moving out of California, possibly up the coast to Oregon, to get in some of that early early retirement he had grown up expecting. 
His uncle was in Eugene, the land of misfit joys, where all the sub-genres go to die. 
He had been there once, to attend his uncle’s wedding, but hadn’t been back in years, and was looking forward to leaving. 
The night before he left, he had decided to meet his old slacker buddies at the local bar, Dave’s. 
He knew it was a bad idea, and he was hoping only Jack and Pete would come, and not bring Jack’s cousin Timmy the timid, a quietly psychotic addition to the once calm and joyful crew.
These days it seemed like the group of friends spent most of their time trying to deal with Timmy’s destructive penchant for chaos. 
There was the time he removed all the lug nuts from a police cruiser while the cops were getting donuts, and taunted them into chasing him in their car, only to have all the wheels fall off one at a time, until the cruiser was crouched on the ground like a landlocked boat. 
He had come across 100 gallons of black paint once, and decided that handicapped people ought not get first dibs on the good parking, and took it upon himself to dump the goopy mess and spread it with a push broom in front of the local grocery store. 
“EQUALITY!!” He had hollered, as the cops dragged him off.
He was known in the town, and cops always stopped him when they saw him, sure he was up to no good, for truly that’s all he was ever up to. 
His parents had given him a car for graduation, but when he used it to create a shortcut through the neighbor’s field, they had tried to reclaim the machine, only to wake one morning and find it in flames in their driveway. 
Timmy claimed ignorance, but they had nothing left to take from him, seeing as his room was empty and grey, his friend group only barely tolerated him, and would tell him to find his own time to cause chaotic nonsense.
Franky took his seat at the bar and ordered a beer, and was distraught to see two officers enter behind him. 
Jack and Pete would be here soon, no doubt with Timmy in tow, who would inevitably cause problems and compromise Franky’s graceful exit from the town.
Franky hesitantly sipped his beer and ran a shaky hand through his red hair. 
He was done with this town. 
He was happy and comfortable with the thought, but the time and space between him and his exit had him highly pensive. 
He needed a cigarette. 
He stood and walked towards the door, and was met by Jack Pete and Timmy just coming in the door.
”Hello, you fellows! I’m off to the tobacco zone. 
I’ll be inside in a second.”
Jack and Timmy continued past, but Pete paused, seeing the cops.
“I think I’ll smoke too.” He said. 
They went out and found the bench out front, and took a perch. 
“You really leaving, huh?” Pete asked.
”I gots to man. 
This place is no longer the launch pad I had hoped it would be. 
It’s become a bog. 
I’m single, broke, jobless, and Timmy compromises everything worthy that we ever manage to muster.”
“I hear that. 
I can’t take much more neither.”
They both paused at the sound of muffled shouts, and looked inside to see the cops standing and squaring off with Timmy. 
Jack was backing slowly towards the door, and Timmy was obviously running out of breath yelling his point at the police officers.
“Oh shit. 
 Here we go. 
Should we save Jack or make good our escape?” Pete asked.
”Gaaaaah!!! I guess it’s my last night in town. 
I owe him one last favor. 
Why not?” Frank replied. 
He opened the door and stepped inside, right as Timmy made a break for it, pushing past Jack, knocking Frank into the bar. 
Frank pushed himself upright as Jack scrambled past him, after Timmy, who had just grabbed a ketchup bottle from the last table by the door, and lobbed it towards the cops, only to have it hit Frank in the face instead. 
Franky reeled and grabbed at the bar stool, but the bottle had struck true, and he fell with a crashing thud onto the table of two officers. 
They immediately jumped up, unaware that Franky was the victim, and quickly subdued the unconscious boy, telling everyone else in the restaurant to calm down and step back and everything is under control. 
One of them grabbed a cup of water from a neighboring table, and threw it in Franky’s face, which brought him violently to life. 
He came up swinging, eyes closed, as if from some horrible night terror, and landed a square one right on officer Davis’s nose. 
Officer Laribar leaped back and went for his billy club as officer Davis careened over the booth into the next table.
Franky’s eyes popped open, and suddenly aware of what he had done but too pumped full of adrenaline to process it logically, he leaped onto the cushioned seat of the booth, leaped onto the neighboring table, and in 2 bounds had reached the door. 
Officer Laribar was still removing his billy club, and Officer Davis was pulling himself out of a stranger’s ham and cheese omelet as Franky took off in the direction of the factory side of town.
Franky didn’t know who had hit him, but he knew he had been hit. 
He had heard the bottle break as he had gone unconscious, but he couldn’t for the life of him figure out who or why. 
His current goal was to simply disappear, and luckily, he knew of a gathering only 10 blocks away at the P & B Furniture Factory on 7th and J Street. 
He had worked there for a month before getting laid off, and hadn’t been around when the boys finally formed a union and started making demands. 
Tonight they were planning on collecting their back pay in the form of the furniture they had made, and burning it in the streets. 
Franky had been curious about the spectacle, but hesitant to join the fray. 
Just another reason to leave town: class warfare, no jobs, chaos in the streets.
Cutting through the park, he passed a dozen or so union workers, idling on benches, waiting for the fireworks to start. 
They were like him; interested but not invested. 
A job is a job, burning furniture didn’t seem relevant to keeping or getting a job, at least not to them. 
Some were discussing alternatives. 
“Why don’t we collect the furniture as pay, and than sell it ourselves?”
“You really think that’s realistic? Where we gonna get a furniture broker? We have no connections in the armchair industry.”
“Well we could get one. 
We’re not gonna have a chance if all you can find is a problem.”
“Well a solution ain’t shit if it’s just an idea. 
Go find a broker!”
“It’s not my job. 
Maybe P & B should do it.”
“Be the brokers for the employees to sell the furniture they get paid in?
“Yeah.”
“They already do that. 
They own a furniture factory. 
How the…. 
 How the fuck did you get this far?”
Franky slowed a bit to try and understand their exchange, but it just confused him, so he dismissed it and sped off through the park. 
He could hear the cries of police men behind him. 
“You Irish bastard! Just try and hide, you ginger prick!!” Franky smiled. 
He never understood why the term ginger should refer to red hair and freckles. 
What the hell is red and freckly about the yellowish tangy spicy root thing known as Ginger? Maybe it was a reference to the old dancer Ginger Rogers. 
did she have red hair? Who the fuck knows? She was black and white. 
Just like the rest of em back than. 
He finally arrived at the P & B building. 
There were hundreds of people gathered, and they were all pressed together, pushing forward, through the glowing dust beneath the yellow street lights. 
Everything looked brown and gray. 
Everyone looked a bit Russian. 
There were many beards and some pitchforks. 
Only one pitch fork. 
People gave the pitchfork space, mildly annoyed at his silly prop.
”We’re not chasing a monster out of town.” One worker had said. 
“ Aren’t we?” He replied.
Franky pushed through, every coat he brushed past feeling like a horse blanket or canvas. 
These people carted themselves around in the kind of material that you transport coarse goods in. 
Bullets and potatoes. 
Rough stuff. 
He couldn’t bear the feeling of being in a crowd. 
One hair lost in a scalp. 
Other people had these feelings when staring into space, but star gazing made Franky feel larger, as if each star was there for him and had been placed specifically according to some preordained order that he would one day recall.
Finally he got to the other side of the crowd, and was greeted with the vision of a sort of wicker-man made of chairs and tables. 
They had obviously put a lot of effort into amalgamating what looked like a dozen dinette sets into a 60 foot tall burnable stick figure. 
He gazed up in wonder, and looked around at the awed crowd. 
They were obviously proud of their work. 
As he looked on, a red headed man, the only other Ginger in the crowd, tossed a Molotov cocktail between the legs of the behemoth wooden avatar, and the crowd started screaming. 
It began pushing and pulling, jostling and gyrating, swarming and swirling. 
Franky realized the statue was going to fall eventually, and at 60 feet tall, it would land on almost a third of the crowd. 
He wasn’t interested in testing his luck, or seeing a violent flaming chaos mess, so he began yelling and pushing and looking for a place to get high up and warn the crowd.
”ITS GONNA FALL!!! GET BACK!!! GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! IT’S BURNING!!” He felt a bit silly for saying something as obvious as “It’s Burning” but he continued anyways, unabated, jamming his way between bodies, towards a tree that had once been in a small 8x8 garden bed, and now was swarmed, looking like a flailing creature caught in a stampede. 
Franky climbed quickly up and began doing hand gestures to the crowd, trying to get the people furthest back to understand where the fall zone was. 
Finally, they seemed to understand him, and the crowd slowly shifted, until there was about 45 feet of space around the burning effigy. 
As it collapsed, the crowd cheered wildly, and it fell against the building, slumping like a tired old drunk. 
As Franky’s eyes relaxed and his heart beat began to subside a bit, he looked down from the tree he was perched in, and saw an officer, his hand inches from Franky’s boot. 
It was officer Laribar, with Davis right beside him. 
They had seen him from afar once he was in the tree, and had misinterpreted his hand gestures as his way of aggravating and controlling the crowd.

Alfonso Beirbach and James Pewterschmidt
Beirbach wheezed and held his back as he was helped into the passenger seat of the shiny black Lincoln by young James Pewterschmidt, son of Beirbach’s deceased partner in the furniture prison industry, old What’s his name Pewterschmidt.
“Come now Uncle Alfie, into the seat. 
Here’s your pillow.”
“Get away from me, you little shit! And stop calling me Uncle Alfie!! It’s Idiotic. 
You sound like a toddler.”
“Oh, you sound like you forgot your vitamin B this morning. 
Here, I have some Valerian root in the glove box. 
That’ll calm you down.”
“Valerian root. 
Calm down. 
I don’t need to calm down! Just get driving. 
I don’t want to be late for the airplane.” James hurried around and took the driver seat, and the pulled out onto Ridge Road. 
The sun was going to rise soon, and the plane was leaving at 6:30 sharp. 
There was always a long to do at the airport, especially with James's cranky uncle, always complaining about the long line, and the ache in his back, and the excessive amounts of luggage he always ended up bringing along. 
James had gotten used to the idea that his only hope of becoming fabulously wealthy was to cater to the rickety old bastard. 
He didn't mind the abuse, after all, he was well aware of his social status as an upper class leech, only wearing such fancy clothes and driving such fancy cars because his uncle, or more accurately, his dead father's old business partner, would not tolerate being seen around town with anyone wearing or driving anything less than the optimum ultimate excessive ornate upper class oligarchian accouterments. 
When James's father the late What's his name Petwerschmidt had died and left his entire fortune to Beirbach, James had been heartbroken. 
He was also sad that his father was dead, but he was especially mortified that Beirbach had in his possession a very ancient artifact which proved to be legally sustainable, and a deathblow to James's claim to the fortune. 
Apparently, Beirbach and Old Pewterschmidt had come to an agreement, long before either of them had any noticeable amount of money, that should either of them die, everything would be left to the other. 
This had been a contract written in grade school, meant to refer to slingshots and marbles, but 70 years later, it still served to be legally compliant and binding. 
When this fact had come to light during the reading of the will, young James had begun by standing up and hurling his cigarette case and spitting at the lawyer who had been reading it out loud. 
he than ran to one of the bookshelves that lined the walls of his late fathers library, and was about to begin peeling them out and hurling them at the lawyer, who had nothing to do with the contract and was only legally obligated to bring to light any specifics that might compromise anyone's supposed claims, when James heard behind him the croaky voice of his false uncle Alfonso. 
"Those are my books now boy. 
And I don't believe you can afford to replace even one of them, so tread softly lest ye be tread on in return." James paused without turning around, dialing in the direction the voice had come from, hoping to hurl the book instead at Uncle Alfie, when he realized it was merely a matter of months, perhaps a year or two, before the second old bastard would croak, and he being the only familial creature remotely connected with the two dried up old billionaires, would obviously become entitled. 
And so instead he turned his animated movement towards his advantage. 
He dropped his head against the shelf and began sobbing. 
"Father!!" He yelled. 
"Why have you forsaken me?!!?" He hadn't meant to quote the bible, and forsaken suddenly sounded like he was mad about the money, so he modified his approach, and continued. 
"Daddy! I'm so young!! I'm not ready to be alone!! What shall I do? What reparations have you made that I might live in your memory and not be cast out to stumble lonely and broken along life's ruthless roads?" He wasn't sure if it was having the hoped effect, so he continued. 
"Father my father! Whence for have you gone quietly into that good night? dark. 
Dark night! where shall I see thee again, and will you know me?!" He felt he might be laying it on a bit thick, so while his face was still pressed against the bookshelf and hidden from view of the others, he plucked a couple of nose hairs to start the tears flowing, and quickly turned around as if suddenly regaining his composure. 
"I'm sorry! It was just so unexpected. 
He was too young."
"He was eighty five, James. 
sit down, and stop preforming. 
It's rather irritating." replied Alfonso. 
The lawyer had moved to the far side of the room and was crouching behind a massive potted plant., ready for another onslaught of bizarre behavior. 
"If you're quite finished, mister pewterschmidt, I'll get on with the proceedings." He said, still crouching. 
"Yes yes. 
I'm fine now. 
I simply cannot abide this life without the love of my dear father. 
I shall have to. 
I shall have to make due. 
Yes. 
It will be fine. 
I will find a woman to keep me company and teach me love."
"Aaaah. 
prostitutes. 
you Are like your father." said Alfonso, well aware that he was referencing James's absent mother who had dropped him off with the maid, and made off with what she considered to be fair alimony : twelve hundred dollars cash, and all the silverware. 
"Uncle, you are a cruel man at heart, but I love you none the less. 
You too, perhaps, might find a woman to teach you what love is, and how one ought to live and behave." James said, trying desperately to appear endearing and irreproachable. 
It was not working in the slightest, but Alfonso was bored of mocking the boy, and gave him a simple
"Perhaps." before motioning the lawyer to please continue. 
 The lawyer continued.
"The entire Pewterschmidt fortune will be transferred to Bierbach under the condition that James Pewterschmidt continues to receive the stipend allowance and access to what goods and services he has always had access to under the care of his father."
This time Alfonso threw a muffin at the lawyer. 
It bounced off his bald head and rolled across the paisley carpeting. 
"What hum buggery is this?! You read the grade school contract. 
There was no other!" Alfie yelled.
"Sir," replied the lawyer, scampering over to his safety zone behind the potted plant. 
"There is a precedent. 
You each were allowed to make on specific exception and extra rule, it says on the Grade School contract. 
If One wants the other to keep their lizard or fish than it is an obligation. 
The pet must be maintained in the same grace and languidness that it enjoyed under the care of the deceased. 
In the absence of pets, we are left with the offspring who falls under the same category of dependant, and thus retains the same rights as your pet fish, sebastian was it? And his pet lizard, Horatio."
"Aaah, Sebastian. 
I do remember. 
And Horatio. 
That scaly little bastard. 
I'm glad he's gone. 
too many times I was assaulted by his visage while passing a bowel movement int he boys room at our little school outside of Auschgodt. 
Old Pewterschmidt would slip him under the stall and laugh maniacally as I howled in fear. 
Now what was that? This boy here, James? I'm supposed to treat him as I would have Sebastian or Horatio?"
"No sir. 
Do not cloud the subject by feigning early onset dementia. 
That would make you ineligible for the inheritance."
"I'm worth 4 billion dollars, you two bit jabber jaw!! I will not be fiddled with by a lawyer!! Accusing me of faking Dementia that I might neglect my own dear partners own dear child. 
I am shocked and appalled at you sir. 
This boy will have all the ... 
accouterments that he has been used to in this life, and he will be buried before me in a grander fashion than his father."
"That's only if I die before you, right uncle alfie?"
"Oh, I suppose." drawled Alfonso. 
The papers were signed, Alfie moved in, and James got to keep his room under the stairs.

Charles the Bard
A dull hollow roar was making its way down the rocky canyon, along the swarming river. 
Squirrels and rabbit skittered out of the clear beach front. 
A humming cackle of nonsense words accompanied the sound, and it all blended in to a common texture and rhythm.
“Now Charles, I want you to go into a deep trance.” Charles heard in his head. 
It was his soothing narrator who would always chime in when he had achieved the proper blend of industrial sounds and natural sounds. 
The roar of the river and the screech of his dirt bike had brought him to his Samsara or whatever. 
“You’re falling backwards now, charles, falling backwards through infinite darkness, away from nothing, and towards nothing. 
You are free and fluid, nothing to impede or distract you from your perfect pure and pointed plummet from nowhere, into nothing.” Charles’s eyes began to shine. 
The trail along the river warped and burbled over roots and rocks, and his internal rhythm became attached to the pattern of these impediments occurring. 
He began to hum softly.
“Hmmmmmmm” and it slowly grew into a vowel sound, perhaps aaaaaaahhhhh. 
The narrator dropped away softly, and Charles began adding consonant impediments for his path of voweling warbles. 
“aaaaaaaabbaaagaaaaaan 
aaa beeeeeeee  gaaaaaaaa  …
I began in a manner not normal nor needed
in all this eternal befuddling dreaming
and on through the mist I’ve been falling for ages
past wizards and warriors, slack jaws and sages,
its on through the morning and into the noon
hat we call on through falling sun nothing to prove. 
It’s the age old dilemma to dance or to die
and we all go to heaven so never be trying
o last out a moment or two til you’re future
is all that you’ve chosen and nothing to suture,
for its but a game and the moment a penny
and if we were children we’d all become venison. 
Nothing to say no one cries out your name
it’s the same old derangement that strangles our brains,
if we can’t find the sunlight we’re doomed in the twilight
of waking to find that our life is what we want. 
Don’t pause in the doorway nor dim down the lights
as it all comes to nothing, our meaningless flights. 
It’s a dreary old maiden who holds out the fig leaf
and craves we behave in the cold shattered streets
I’ve lost all the most holy of leftover longings
we struggle so long to get back to the stream
by the cleft in the valley we once knew so well
we once once grew up and flew through to heaven from hell
and it’s almost a mystery how did we come to this now?”
All of a sudden the fox was right beneath Dark Charles’s tire. 
A squishy pop, and the massive rodent was no more. 
Dark Charles came screeching to a sudden stop, and hopped off his bike. 
The fox lay there twitching terribly, in the throes of his death rattle. 
Dark Charles approached, and for a moment wore an expression of grave mourning. 
This had been the only creature in all the world he trusted. 
He always knew where the fox would be, when it would approach from the bushes. 
Charles even knew which bush it would be appearing from. 
But this time he had been too deep in his hypnotic rambling trance to know when where or how quickly his fox friend would approach. 
He had failed his sacred role as caretaker off these innocent woods. 
All this ran through his head in less than a second before he stomped his heel down swiftly, breaking the fox’s neck and sending it quickly to the other side. 
There was no tear in Charles’s eye.
He picked the corpse up and slung it into a canvas sack which he tied down to his dirt bike, and immediately hopped back on his bike, and let out a deep and mournful wail, which he slowly modified with consonant sounds until he was rambling actual words which pulled themselves together into a coherent culling song.
“Aaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeee…….
Aaaaammmmm  Heeeeeeeeeee….
I let it go and looked aloft,
I lost a life I trailed off. 
I cannot be what is the cause of all this,
its larger and less we shall all be the guest
in the end of the great lonely reaper to be
in the presence of he pleasant sense of relief,
we shall own what we own and move on down the road
o a space made to hold us so deep in the forest. 
I caaaaaa   ot be brokeeeee …. 
By thiiiiiings, I cannot chaaaaaaange.”
As he rounded the corner, the rocky river bend was once more cleanly silent, the only movement being a crawdad, 4 feet underwater, scurrying along the bottom. 
The crawdad wandered out to a small gray lump that seemed to him to be edible, but upon inspection with his clinchy claws, he decided it was some scrap of human waste. 
Unusable for the average crawdad. 
Mere schmegma. 
He gracefully glided his way back to the large egg shaped rock to rest for a bit in the shadow of its greeny rhombus mass.

Frankie and Papa Charles
The new prison was better than the old prison, but it was a subsidiarity of Beirbach and Pewterschmidt Incorporated, built on the ruins of the burnt down factory. 
Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had planned the whole thing, investing in riot insurance and arson insurance for massively more than the factory was worth, and hiring a certain “Stinky Terrance” to soak the Wicker man in gasoline and sabotage it to fall against the factory wall, sending the whole place up, which of course would be full of freshly stained furniture and buckets of varnish with no lids, and all their misfiled lost and thoroughly over cooked books, by chance might be lost in the glorious display of Protesters Incompetence. 
And the immediate redevelopment of the land into a prison, which pumped out the same furniture, only by workers who were paid 5 cents an hour and couldn’t leave.
It was the perfect factory, which Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had been debating ever since building the factory : How might one maximize the functionality and profit margin? And this whole prison gambit was officially a keeper. 
Institutionalized slavery! And to be on the good side of things for once. 
Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had patted each other on the backs for that one. 
And had a tendency to monitor the two prisoners who had been attached to the riots which had caused the burning down of the factory and the building of the prison which now housed them. 
Franky and Papa Charles. 
 They couldn’t have been more different. 
For Pewterschmidt and Beirbach, they were a reminder of a time past, a gamble which paid off marvelously, for every one but Franky and Papa Charles.
Franky had grown harder as time went on, spending his first ten years explaining to everyone that he had not been part nor party to the riots, and had been running from the cops for some unrelated reason, which was also not his fault. 
And he’s got family in Eugene whose probably still waiting for him.
After about a thousand repetitions over the course of ten years, which is only 3 times a day on average, he finally settled in to his new surroundings, and started to adopt a more functional attitude, of crass indifference and aggression. 
He had been thrown into a world that he had to quickly and violently adapt to, and was still off the opinion that nothing could be further from his fault.
Meanwhile, Papa Charles took his time as a retirement. 
He always had a book that he was excited to talk about, he was always distracted by tiny animals and bugs or flowers and dirt patterns on the other side of the yard while everyone else traded cigarettes played cards and lifted weights. 
He was left alone for the most part, because he was Papa Charles. 
He had built this place. 
He and Franky. 
Everyone treated them like holy old timers. 
After all, it had been 40 years. 
They’d been in longer than most of the inmates had been alive. 
And they were finally approaching release.
……………………………………………………………………..

"Dinner's ready!!" Hollered Aunt Dezzie, her portly form filling the doorway to the family double wide trailer. 
The boys were all crouched around a crackling fire, discussing Cousin Ned's latest invention. 
They had been hunting ghosts as a past time ever since Aunt Dezzie had let them all start crashing on her floor. 
There was Pete and Joey and Jeff and Dave and Leroy and Cousin Ned. 
Ned was the only one related to Aunt Dezzie. 
He was her son. 
Everyone else called him cousin and her aunt, to suggest some sort of familial obligation towards tolerance. 
Dezzie and Ned didn't mind. 
They enjoyed the company, and the boys were mostly harmless, simply hoping for enough space to lounge around and laugh at each others odd suggestions concerning ghosts, UFOs, alternative histories, alternative fuels, and alternative rock music. 
"I hear ACDC is really the front for a private club of Freemasons who have solved the question of how to extract electricity from water." Offered up Pete, scratching his curly dirty brown hair which tumbled down onto his red flannel jacket, tangling and flourishing like a waterfall of muddy electricity. 
"That's ridiculous. 
They'd never let those rock stars into the Freemasons. 
They're all about sex and drugs. 
Not the higher forms of knowledge and exploration that the Freemasons are known for." Retorted Joey. 
"Didn't you know, Elvis got kicked out once they found out he was on them pills?" Joey threw a handful of sawdust into the flames, and everyone jumped back a bit as it cackled and sputtered a bit higher. 
Joey loved fire. 
He had accidentally burned down the orphanage of his later origin, which led him to run away, never finding out his real last name or home town or living relatives or any such thing. 
Joey was a preemie, born prematurely to a mother who drank through her pregnancy and than left him on the doorstep of the orphanage with the note pinned to him, just like she'd seen on television, before hauling off to Vegas to seek her fortune as a dancing girl. 
Joey didn't know this, and never would know. 
He didn't even know the complications of his birth which caused his stilted vocabulary and simplified logicality. 
"Boys! Get in! It's gettin cold!" Dezzie called again. 
Jeff and Dave were the first to hop up, never to embarrassed to be the first to serve themselves in the buffet line that Dez always lined up in the kitchen for them. 
First, a bowl of about 3 gallons of mashed potatoes. 
Than, a bucket full of gravy. 
3 loafs of home cooked bread, a 2 gallon pot of sloppy joe barbecue beef, and a side salad, just enough for Dezzie. 
There was a time when she would make enough greens for everyone, but it always ended up getting tossed out to the chickens, who made their home in the 20x40 backyard, fenced in from foxes and raccoon by a ramshackle fence the boys had arranged out of found fallen limbs. 
The fence had begun as a mere 10x10 section, but over the years the boys had continued adding to it, making it taller and scooting it further out til it almost appeared to be the edge of some sort of shrubbery forest. 
Jeff and Dave had also been runaways, but from military school to which they had been sent separately by their parents, Jeff by his plumber father and stay and home mother who were already frustrated and overrun by their six other children, from a small town in Washington inhabited by 3500 people, and Dave by his single mother who only had him to watch but simply couldn't find the time between her hair appointments, nail appointments, getting the dog groomed and the car washed and her belly waxed and her tummy tucked and her face exfoliated and the house cleaned by Rosa who tolerated more abuse than a dog who was put to fights. 
Jeff and Dave had met at the military academy and found out that neither of them missed home, and neither of them thought much of this up tight institutionalized compartment making gentrifying simplificator of an approach to pumping out predictable passive citizen types who wouldn't make waves except to crush the ones who stand out or stand up or stand while others sit or stand by the newspaper stand simply because they have nowhere to be. 
Jeff and dave were not willing to become genericized. 
They enjoyed the fact that they had no attachments back home except for the odd girl they might have passing interest in, which they assumed would never be returned. 
So when Jeff ended up finding a pair of keys that let them out of the great big lock box the grown ups called the dorms, and out into the fields where there were dancing spot lights every night, Dave was an easy sell on the idea that they might even be obligated by some higher power to pursue their new found freedom and find the rare the unreachable, the untouched path that all these who choose to remain passive might never get a chance to tread upon. 
After all, who finds big foot? Not the boardwalk crowd. 
Not the bowlers. 
Not the pool playing bar hanging dart chucking beer sucking normal folk who go to factory jobs and kiss their factory wives with the smell of old buddy wiser on their lips, smacking their asses and asking for pizza or spaghetti to make the beer simmer, and their bodies slip deeper into the folds of their couches that they might lounge uncontrollably, deeper and softer until they cant move until the next morning when coffee will be ready, and there will be frozen berries for pancakes, and peanut butter jelly int heir plastic lunchboxes, because they spent the money for lunch meat on beer, and you don't need brain food in the morning when your job is to simply stamp out then thousand similarly shaped plastic doohickeys every day, for which use the upper management might know, but the people on the floor pushing the buttons and sorting the parts had no idea nor care nor worry whether it was a gun barrel or a firing pin or a boat shimmy or a doohickey whatsit. 
All just a loop to get lost in for fifty years before finally getting to collect a paycheck for simply having been there for the majority of your life. 
Jeff and Dave were happy to dodge that american dream. 
Nightmare. 
Leroy was the only one among the group that had grown up with Dezzie and Ned. 
They had always been in the trailer park on the edge of the woods in Northern California on the Oregon border. 
It had always been the way it was, Dezzie cooking, Ned and Leroy wandering the woods and wondering how to track bigfoot or signal a UFO or find out the truth about the free masons and the astronauts and the rock and roll stars who were obviously all in cahoots, sending each other signals in their songs and their architecture and their video footage. 
First they had been convinced that the moon landings were real. 
Than they had found out they were faked on a sound stage in ... 
where was it? New Mexico? And the proof was the flag flappin, because there aint no wind on the moon. 
But than some old timer they met at the bar had explained to them that there was still rotation on the moon, and the rotation was enough to send the flag flying in one particular direction, and our flags only fell limp when the rotation perfectly canceled out the wind, and really it was all real. 
The old timer had claimed to have been a janitor on the space shuttle, and had wiped down the seats and scrubbed the control panels and shaken hands with leo armstrong or what was it. 
Leroy and Ned had been real excited by this interaction, and had come up with a new theory, the moon landings were pretended to be fake so that the american people would be unaware just how advanced government technology really was, and we were already on mars and pluto, and harvesting natural gasses from Jupiter to run through our stoves and cook our foods. 
After all, weren't we due to run out of natural gasses pretty soon? And this had led them to the alternative fuels discussion, and a dozen different drifters who came through town telling the boys high tales about the new car that runs on water, and how corn will solve all our problems, and how solar is a lie because it takes more energy to build, and there are diamonds that just give off energy all day, and we just have to bring the right kind of diamond into a cave and wait for it to glow or wiggle or something, and the deeper in the ground it is, the more likely it is to occur. 
Ned and Leroy weren't so much into figuring out how it Actually was, they were just more fascinated by the infinite number of ideas that people thought must be happening. 
"Man Ned, if all this is happening behind the scenes, I'd say about ninety five percent of the world is behind the scenes. 
Whatever the scenes are." 
"I'd say that makes a lot of sense Leroy." Replied Ned as they tried once more to calibrate their Bigfoot call. 
It was a predator call that had been modified with a resonance chamber and an amplifier so that it would hit more frequencies at higher and lower octaves simultaneously than any other call on the market. 
If it worked like they hoped it would, they expected a veritable Noah's ark to show up, which is why they had chosen to climb the tallest tree they could manage before plugging it in, hooking it up, giving each other the lucky hand shake with their fingers intertwined and spitting in opposite directions. 
Than... 
they flipped on the battery powered speaker, and Ned blew into the mouth piece, and a crackling gargling sound like ten thousand animals screaming their death as they got sucked into the worlds largest blender came bellowing out, the sheer shock of which nearly knocked the both of them out of the tree. 
The sound echoed up and down the canyons. 
Birds scattered from every tree, and the sky was suddenly filled. 
It would be reported in all the papers that there may be some Russian nuclear testing that had gone terribly wrong, which made very little sense, because the Russians don't test anything in northern California, but news is news, and news is just bullshit thought up to sell papers, but that's not what we're talking about. 
The sound shook, them both up so much, they switched it off, and without saying a word, made their way shakily back down the tree, finally slumping against the trunk and releasing a gushing sigh of relief. 
A lone squirrel scampered past, pausing long enough to examine the two distraught human beings. 
The only reason the squirrel had stuck around is because he had gone deaf the month prior when it had taken a nap inside the air horn of a semi truck parked on the side of Highway five. 
Ned and Leroy were done with their experiment, and made their way home to Dezzie's home cooked slop. 
..........................
9. 
Wilson and his beautiful red Rocky Rx7 raced along the glowing highway as the dawns early light peeked over the far edge. 
Wilson was so glad to be out and off into nowhere land, he began howling and waving his head back and forth. 
He had ended up getting a convertible, because his horns made it hard to get in and out of a normal car, and even in the crisp air he lived for the air, for the breeze, for the screaming wind passing through his hair and across his face across asphalt through trees into space once more and back, carrying water and particles dust and pollen, the very blood of earth, this air. 
He felt like a white blood cell, racing along a vein, pursuing some unknown bacteria that he had been put on this planet to exterminate. 
He felt alive and ready. 
The sun hadn't quite made it to the sky yet, still lounging in its bed of deep space, and the stars were just beginning to fade. 
Wilson looked straight up into the depths and immensity of the sky, and let out a long happy wail, only looking forward at the last second as an oncoming car with its brights on laid on its horn and began swerving across the road way out of its own lane, which Wilson had unwillingly occupied with his vehicle while gazing upward. 
He too began swerving and swearing, slamming on breaks and bracing for impact as both cars just barely clipped each other and crumpled, Wilson into a guard rail, and the other car into a tree. 
The other car was a shiny black Lincoln, and a tall thin queer looking man emerged from the driver seat, obviously rattled, obviously irate, obviously ready to run or cry or faint, whichever seemed the most fitting. 
Wilson's car hadn't flipped or anything, simply grinding along the railing ruining his paint job and jostling him severely. 
His neck felt a bit pinched, and his elbow had actually been gashed open, but like all good wounds, it hadn't come to his attention quite yet. 
His car started back up rather hesitantly, and he pulled across the road and parked by the wrecked Lincoln. 
reaching for his door, he finally realized that his left elbow had been rather flayed by the closer than close call, and he suddenly shrieked out in pain. 
James Pewterschmidt, for that's who had been driving the Lincoln, finally looked closely at the offending driver of the red RX7, and let out a blood curdling shriek. 
"AaaaaiiieeeeE!!!!!!! Satan!!! You've come! Its the other side!! I'm not ready!!! Where is my father?!!? You've come for Alfie! Not for me! He's in the passenger seat!! I"M TOO YOUNG!!!" Wilson was shocked and appalled at this behavior, and it took him a moment to realize his horns were showing. 
The poor bastard thought he was the devil! Wilson was half tempted to give the strange stuffy shirted man a bizarre show, warning him of the dangers of an immoral life, but decided it would be a waste of both of their times, and he'd rather just be real, and not risk getting dragged into court for liabilities and impersonating a fallen angel and all this other whatnot. 
Who knows what California law might say about impersonating the devil. 
He wouldn't be surprised if there was an actual law on the books... 
"Any man caught impersonating the devil will be kept in a heated cell and poked with pitch forks for ten thousand years or until dead, whichever comes first." 
"Woah there, calm down buddy. 
They're just horns. 
I'm not the devil. 
It's called a cutaneous growth. 
I just was lucky enough to have two. 
It's a sort of benign cancer. 
I'm not from hell, I'm not here for your soul, and I don't know who alfie is. 
Here, wanna feel them?" James approached cautiously, obviously unconvinced, and reached out an uncalloused manicured hand, and gently brushed against one of the horns. 
He than smelled his finger. 
"Turtle wax?"
"You expected brimstone, I presume. 
Nope. 
Not even sulfur. 
Just the same wax I use on my car. 
Gee whiz, I'm gonna need to do some work on poor rocky. 
I mangled it good!!" Wilson responded. 
"Now who the hell is this Alfie? Have you checked on him? Or were you too busy pissing yourself to care?" Wilson walked around the car and yanked open the passenger door. 
Alfie's head was hanging forward, but shot up all of a sudden, and he swung his cane at Wilson. 
"Get Behind me Satan!! You have no dominion over my soul for I have been a good and charitable christian!!!" Shouted Alfie at Wilson.
"Good lord gramps, aint you never seen a human with horns before? I miss L.A. 
People expect this kinda thing down there. 
up here, it's all hoobity joo and curses and voodoo and catholic dark mass or whatever the hell you people are into. 
Don't worry gramps, I'm a good guy. 
I'm not Satan."
"The Father of Lies!! I should trust you? Ha!!! You must think I'm a child. 
I'm sure James here believes you, after all, he's never lived on his own nor thought on his own nor paid for a single meal himself!!! If I were to take from him all that has been given freely to him, he'd be left here naked as an infant, and twice as poor. 
He's a... 
your eyes. 
They seem too soft to be satans eyes."
"So you know what Satan's eyes look like, eh?"
"and your voice. 
You're just a middle american. 
Just like any of the factory workers I hire and fire on a daily basis."
"You don't do any hiring. 
OR firing, Uncle Alfie. 
That's all done for you by Factory Foremen." petitioned James.
"Yes, but it's all done in my name. 
Just as this freak of nature no doubt acts according to the will of his dark overlord, SATAN!!!" 
Wilson was growing tired of this bizarre line of conversation, and had begun tending to his wound. 
It's funny how skin will split open and filet like that, almost like you could turn it into a secret pocket. 
Wilson considered how this might benefit him, if he ever decided he ought to intentionally impersonate the devil, instead of being mistaken for him. 
He tore his shirt into a tourniquet for his arm and began to wrap the remainder of the cloth tightly around his wound, knotting it and re-knotting it into a sling. 
Finally he was repaired to what extent he could be, and was able to examine Alfie. 
"Alright pops, lets have a look at you. 
can you stand up?"
"Of course I can stand up!" replied Alfie, and made a terrible effort at leaping effortlessly from the car, instead collapsing on the street in front of Wilson. 
standing above him, Wilson could finally see the blood rushing down the left side of his face. 
"Alright buddy, help me with pops here. 
He's hurt bad. 
He's too ornery to notice. 
I think he just passed out from blood loss. 
How much blood is in this old guy? He looks like a deflated white balloon! Buddy!! Snap out of it!!" James was in reverie, watching the two wounded creatures, the one armed creature trying to lift the bloody old decrepit creature onto the hood, struggling like he was holding tooo maaany .... 
puppies? James thought about what it might mean if he simply stood by and watched the old man die, but he decided that this stranger might protest and than speak out in court, and that might compromise James's case. 
So He stepped in and helped lift Uncle Alfie on the hood of the RX7, where his head was bandaged, and a pillow put under it. 
Wilson finally stepped back and surveyed the situation, only to find the two left tires on his car had been exploded by the grinding along the guard rail. 
They were temporarily castaway lost and immobile. 
......................................................
10. 
Papa Charles was released right along side Frankie. 
It was midnight. 
Nobody was waiting for either of them. 
Their families had long ago fell out of contact with them, and all their friends were long dead. 
They had spent 40 years in the same prison, and hadn't exchanged more than a dozen words. 
Usually it had been Papa Charles asking Frankie for a match or a smoke or a pen or his extra dessert. 
Frankie had always obliged Charles, never responding except for the time Charles had asked Frankie why he hadn't seen him at the pre-riot rally. 
"I wasn't there for the riot." was all Frankie had said, and his voice was so thick and heavy with the weight of false accusation and undeserved punishment that Charles had ceased ever trying to broach the topic again. 
Now, on the crisp cold January sidewalk of East Mizoula, 4 miles from town, they were equals. 
No longer a guilty rioter paying his dues to society next to an innocent man forced to stoop like the dog he never was. 
Now they were just two men with no connections, no plans, no idea of what the world might be like now. 
They half expected flying cars and robots that do your shopping for you. 
Frankie suddenly said six more words.
"So. 
What the hell happens now?" Papa Charles slowly turned his head like a sphynx, as i about to expound a gloriously unsolvable conundrum, but instead just made a fart sound. 
"ppptthhhh." Frankie grinned and nodded. 
"Than we are in agreement. 
Well papa charles, you're a bit older than me, so I feel an obligation to keep an eye on you and make sure you don't have some sort of cardiac arrest at the sudden approach of a flying car or a shopping robot, so what say you we stick together?" Papa charles smiled back and gave another fart sound of approval.
"ppptthhhhh." and off they strolled into the atmosphere, unaware of what might befall them, anticipating a future which neither of them could possibly be ready for, unaware that things tended to end up similar if not literally the exact same as always, simply refurbished, repainted, reupholstered, and redone. 
It was all the same. 
Men were rude, women were far too clever, bosses were bastards, workers were lazy, minorities were after our jobs, majorities were selfish and lazy, french people were pretentious and condescending, irish people were drunk... 
The author of this narrative does not agree with any of these uncultured statements, and is merely relaying the biases that these two held common between them, and as they strolled off towards the glimmering horizon, these were the subject matters they pondered and passed between themselves. 
The same old shit that every one rambles about as the days pass by like lizards skittering away from the tire of the car that caries the grim reaper, heaped up with a list 9 billion long of people who are next in line to be sent off into the the grand whatnot on the other side. 
Frank and Charles never got around to mentioning death or considering what life they had missed. 
They were too fascinated by the experience of having no walls except the darkness of early morn to hold them in. 
No rules except gravity, no requirements except to continue breathing. 
Their walk was pleasant, and their talk was as if they had never spent most of their lives behind bars. 
...........................
11. 
Without the fox, there was nothing holding Charles the Bard in the Big Sur Mess. 
he'd made friends with several trees when he first arrived, but he had quickly (over the course of 6 months) become tired of their dull affable consistency and irrelevant input. 
Always the same wordless message about standing strong and persevering, bending and not breaking, staying in touch with your roots, and praising the sun with physical demonstrations of allegiance. 
Trees were still a key and central obsession for Charles the Bard, but they were no longer sufficient to hold his attention and keep him rooted. 
The loss of the fox had reopened the gap in his life, the hole in his heart. 
The craving for interaction with his own species. 
Who could survive out there alone with nothing but bugs and wind, squirrels and a dirt bike to keep company with? The weekly visits to the gas station to keep his bike going were pleasant enough, but weren't quite sanity, weren't quite meaningful. 
He knew he had come to the end of his self imposed ostracization, and was feeling apprehensive about returning to the world. 
he decided that the gas station attendant might be able to help him embrace his new found goal of reintegration. 
he came braping up the one dirt trail that led to the 1, down near lucia, and looked up and down the empty highway. 
From where he was, he could see 3 miles down the coast in either direction, and the 6 buildings in sight set him immediately on edge. 
This is no way to live, he thought. 
Crammed in together like they needed each other? Where is the freedom and solitude and infinite silence of nature? Where is the sacredness and the climbing feeling of spirit? Charles gripped this feeling with his inner self, and gave it a swirl, swapping the negatives with positives, suddenly turning his feelings into erratic anticipatory enthusiasm. 
What could these humans have to offer him, living in such a different way? What might he offer them? How might the world thrive due to their exchange? He blinked many many times, revved in neutral like a squirrel if squirrels could get that loud, and careened off towards the overpriced gas station where he tended to get his gas in exchange for yard work. 
He had given them over a hundred hours in the last 6 months, and they still owed him around 22 gallons. 
Pulling into the gas station, Charles was happy to see Sylvester, the local gas pumper. 
he was a happy old timer who had chosen to return to his first ever job, except at a station he owned, and on the big sur coast. 
Who could argue? He seemed to be living an idyllic life. 
"Hey there vester. 
I've reached a problem. 
" Charles stated flatly. 
"Well, I suppose we as humans are prone to finding and making and causing such things. 
what's the problem chuck? you're doing good out there in the woods, right? I never seen anyone like you take so naturally to this here absence and aggressive chaos that the big sur nature hast o offer."
"My fox died. 
I don't know what to do."
"Things die when they must go. 
And they leave behind folks who are meant to be alone right than. 
What is there to worry about?"
"I guess that's all I needed. 
Thanks Charles. 
Replied Sylvester, and quick as a bat, Charles was off again, headed up towards coast ridge road..
11. 
"He's coming to!" cried Wilson. 
"Thank goodness." Cried James, feigning concern. 
"I was worried he might not make it. 
I thought he might leave me cast adrift in this sea of unfeeling creatures known as life. 
What pain we all must go through, watching our loved ones slowly whither beneath the ruthless eye of the sun." James held a hand to his face as if controlling his emotions.
"Calm down buddy. 
you don't gotta convince me. 
you've already given yourself away far too easily. 
You're gonna get this guys riches when he kicks the bucket, aint ya. 
Well just chill out. 
You won't be watching him die today. 
He's gonna make it. 
You'll just have to wait another... 
few months? Look at this dried up old carcass! just calm down and let him die at his own pace. 
You're obviously not going hungry. 
Hang on, he's not awake. 
He's just rambling. 
Let's listen." And indeed, Alfonso had begun rambling in his wounded unconscious state. 
"Charlotte! I'm sorry charlotte. 
You forgive me don't you? The furs I got you! I gave you everything I had! I showed you all the love I could muster! I gave you all the attention I'm capable of generating for another broken human! Are we not all broken Charlotte? Can you really hold it against me that I could not sustain my simplicity? I did what I could! I thought I was doing well. 
How could you choose Pewtie over me? I gave you more than riches! I have you more than a house on the beach and your own private carriage! I have you my very heart! but you had no interest in that sort of silly behavior. 
You wanted my very soul. 
You wanted me to give it all up and join some sort of religious order with you. 
what nonsense! What silly offhand inconsequential hoobityjoo. 
What could have made you force me into such a decision? I loved you! We made love! You left aglow. 
We were as one! And you threw it away because you thought money was dirty and I wanted us to be comfortable. 
Where are you now Charlotte? Where are you now? Are you alive? And what would our child have been like, had my seed ever taken? And why did it not? Oh, the sorrow. 
Oh the loneliness. 
Long after we had the factory burned to the ground, long after we turned our attentions towards running prison factories to bring the broken folk back into a reasonable human sort of semblance of social contribution. 
you could not forgive me for things you didn't even know I had done. 
You simply read it in my face that I had earned my life my wealth my riches through something less than christian perfection. 
you had the least realistic expectations o humans. 
This is not what humans do! They do not get pregnant and abandon their wealthy partners. 
There is no logic in this! There is no function to this sort of behavior! Yes, I knew you were pregnant. 
I may be male but I am not blind. 
The glow, the flashing defensiveness, the sudden demand that I change, that I join you in your religious voyage. 
All the while never telling me to where or for what you were bound. 
You wanted me as a blind pet to help you raise a child that I had by no means meant to have with you. 
And where is this child now? What have you don't with my boy??! Or girl. 
I don't know what gender it may have been. 
Though I have heard that the hard hearted male is more prone to masculine offspring, which would mean I had a boy, and if he's anything like me he's a spiteful bastard, true term, not an insult, simply an observation. 
There's no way my heart is soft enough to create a creature of feminine benevolence and tenderness, oh Charlotte, how could you leave me so? I was not ready I am not ready. 
I am old and dry, broken and abandoned by all that has ever meant anything to me."
James had begun pacing wildly early on in the speech, and Wilson had quickly caught on to the subtext that there might be another heir out there to compromise the wealth. 
Wilson cackled quietly to himself. 
It's amazing how much people will reveal about themselves without even realizing. 
These bizarre details of the up and ups were enough to distract him from the horrendous fate that Rocky had undergone. 
Wilsonwas glad that he had his little life with his little wife with the walls full of little figurines, his little paychecks putting new layers of acrylic paint on their porcelain pants and English hats and bunny rabbit ears an trowels and such. 
He loved his life, even if he spent most of his time at work or avoiding the house with drives. 
He loved the life he avoided. 
After all, you can be completely in love with something you never see. 
Absence makes the heart grow fonder! He thought of Matilda, perched on her stool in the den, her spectacles poised on the edge o her nose, her lips in pouty concentration. 
What a rare and bizarre world he had found, what a fair and irreproachable niche of human decency. 
Not like this whiny little punk putting on a display of concern for a stranger lest he be pushed out of the inheritance for being calloused and hoping the old bastard might die. 
And what a gut this old bastard had, swinging his cane and hollering about the devil! Never seen anything like it. 
Straight out off television. 
Wilson whistled softly between his teeth, and walked back over to the old timer to tune in to some more juicy subconscious streams of ancient gossip.
"We did it right, Pewterschmidt and I. 
We made the workers do the work, we set them up to burn it down, and than we tricked them into rebuilding it. 
You should have been there Charlotte. 
You shunned me by abandoning me and stealing my offspring. 
I would have sent detectives and greyhounds after you. 
I would have sent militia and bounty hunters to drag you back to me, and to present me with my errant mate and my irreproachable offspring. 
Oh dear oh dear. 
Oh fuck prick shit piss. 
Who gives a bastards ass anymore. 
It's all gone its all done. 
I'm not strong enough to care, I'm not young enough to stay proper any more. 
let me slink into dementia, let me dither away into incompetence, impotence, incontinence. 
It's all the same now. 
Let the piss flow and the shit be as it is. 
Stark raving realism. 
It's too late now. 
I see not a light, I feel not a glow. 
I only know its not where we were, it's not all we hoped. 
Would that I kept that fuckery of a shoe shine job with old Joe the black bitch bastard. 
He never cared. 
Happiest man I ever saw. 
I thought I'd be happier than him by being stronger and richer and more ruthless than him. 
Oh, what a backfire, oh what fooly. 
Oh fuck. 
Oh fuck. 
Now I'm stuck with this young James of a prick. 
Who would have unloaded this dump onto one such as me? How could this possibly seem proper? And would m'boy have been as intolerable, as obnoxious, as scared and hungry and ruthless as this little jimmy prick? I pray to god not. 
How could he? Pewtie never knew how to raise anything. 
Just like his lizard Horatio, a vicious scaly godless vermin creature that was never meant to be a human companion. 
No. 
My boy will be like Sebastian my serene and Buddhist fish, always wide eyed and calm, the perfect combination of interest and detachment. 
Never too quick, never too stupid. 
The quick and the dead, the slow and the foolish. 
Neither would my son be. 
Would that I might see him now. 
Wherefore art though now young my boy? It is the east and my boy is the moon. 
Who shall call to me now with the future, the facts?" 
James had gone off to sulk 30 feet away. 
Wilson was getting a little overwhelmed by the onslaught of subconscious mumblings, and almost went and joined him, but instead chose to pop back into rocky and turn on some tunes. 
No cell phone service, no cars passing by. 
They were stranded, prisoners of the mountain, doomed to simply wait and see what might come of all the hoobity joo goopy jaw looping in and out of unpredictable randomness.
...........................................
13. 
Ned and Leroy had finally fixed up the shit wagon, and gotten going. 
It had always been almost road worthy, but they had never had a reason to pull through the final push. 
It was much more satisfying as a permanent potential than as a tool with no project. 
But now, with their ghost phone and the new information, they had finally given the shit wagon a purpose and simply put all the pieces they'd been cleaning back together and into the guts, and fired her up, and south they had gone. 
South with the magic machine ticky tacking the ghost words through the heat plate, telling them a long strange back story in Morse code as they hurtled along highway 1 Souther and Souther. 
"Hey ned, the ghost wants you to take the next left and go to the 5. 
He says it's quicker."
"Tell the ghost I don't care, Leroy. 
Tell him the shit wagon can't go over 45, and I don't want to be breaking down now that we have a place to go and some sort of purpose." Leroy looked over at Ned, and out the windshield, and back at the ghost phone.
"He can hear you ned. 
remember to be nice, or he might start haunting us." 
"Ask him if he CAN haunt us. 
All he can do so far as we know is touch things and make them cold. 
That's not very haunting, especially if you have a good jacket on." Ned's eyes never left the road as the northern California landscape skidded past. 
The bleak blackish blue ocean on the right, the shrubby hills of Bodega Bay on the left, the sun finally about to crawl past the horizon. 
NEd was happy to have finally found a channel that reached the other side, though he did feel as though he had lost the mystery. 
It had begun as an experiment, as all things do. 
he had one day realized in deep conversation with the boys that most hauntings were concerned with some spot feeling especially cold, which seemed to represent the presence of ghost. 
this had led him to develop a machine which would translate any temperature change into a sort of Morse code. 
This was obviously reliant on the ghost knowing Morse code, so they had ended up wandering the abandoned resort at the end of penultimate drive, waiting for a dead rich person or celebrity to hear them hollering "tap the heat plate! Reach us oh long dead spirit! Send us a message! Send it by tapping Morse code with you cold spirit finger from the other side!! The heat plate will translate it into Morse code for us, and we will know what you are trying to say!!!"  The heat plate had only generated randomness for the first couple days, but the boys were resilient and true believers in possibility and hadn't given up their pursuit, taking turns wandering and hollering while the others loafed on the broken down deck chairs on the rotted out lounge area perched on the rocky bay that had once been known as the port of benevolence, an ironic name for the jet set off the forties whom had made their fortune off of prison factories and war bonds and such. 
Finally, on day three, Joey had come skittering back like a slingshot, screaming with a crackling voice. 
"IT's HAPPENED!! They're TALKING!!! There's someone THERE!!! On the OTHER SIDE!!!" The boys had all leapt up, Pete catching Joey as he careened into the group, Ned catching the machine as it flew from his fidgety fingers, and Leroy quickly taking up the notepad and quickly taking down the code that was coming through. 
"I was by the food shack on the other side of the pools, by the tennis courts! I was just kinda saying quietly, not yelling, just kinda saying "hey, dead guys, if you're there, let me know. 
when all of a sudden it started really pumping out signals! Not just the occasional ones, like before. 
it wasn't just the wind or whatever was triggering it before. 
This was.. 
look at it!! IT's going!!! It's doing it!?!!!!! You did it NED!! YOU DID IT!!! !" Ned immediately felt a stillness, a calmness, almost a boredom. 
The hunt was over. 
Now it was simply a matter processing the new information. 
Why did this leave him drained and weary? Why would this be less than ecstasy? Ned was slightly bothered by this feeling, but shrugged it off quickly, and feigned a joyful resignation. 
"Well boys, this will most likely be our marching orders! You know that ghosts only exist when they have something left to finish on this plane of existence. 
I suppose we'll be the errant boys of the after life. 
Sent off on infinite pursuits of a seeming inconsequential nature. 
Are we ready? Can we do this? I guess we'll need more of these machines. 
Let's see now. 
Who's going to take this first mission?" He scanned the faces of the boys who were all agog, watching with jaws agape, as the machine rattled out clickity clacks and Leroy jotted them down. 
Pete had begun simultaneously translating the tacks into letters, slowly spelling out the message. 
"T..... 
 H..... 
 E..... 
R.... 
E..... 
 oh boy,t his is gonna take a minute. 
There. 
That's the first word! There!" 
"Don't translate one word at a time. 
Just do all the words, and tell us what it says after. 
" Said Jeff. 
Dave had already positioned himself to be the reader of the message, and in slow stifled speech they released the unspeakable from the land of the nonphysical.
.................................
14. 
"You know what got me through?!" Frankie positioned to Charles. 
"If I had to guess I'd say it was you're incessant denial of guilt and hope to one day prove your innocence." retorted Chuck.
"Well aint you the charming psychoanalyst." Replied Frank, less than endearingly. 
"No, I only spent my twenties cursing my fate. 
But somewhere in there I realized that most people int heir twenties spend their time cursing their fate. 
I'm pretty sure that turning thirty is when people finally accept their presence and role and become realistic. 
What got me through was my realism. 
I tapped into the realm I had been assigned, and I became good at it."
"You did have a gift for swaggering through the hallways and keeping the new guys in check." Agreed Chuck. 
"I was initially annoyed at your plea of innocence, but after a few years I started to believe you and gave you space so that I might not betray my doubt or my disappointment at your lack of guilt. 
After all, I took joyous part in the mess. 
I was proud that I had earned my half century demonstrating beyond a shadow of a doubt my disapproval of things as they sit."
"And how gloriously effective that protest ended up being, eh? They'll remember you forever, as old whats his name, the guy who went to jail for some such reason or another. 
You did your thing, and you did your time. 
I did my thing, and I did someone else's time. 
But int he end no one gives a shit, and we all land where we end up regardless of our intentions or innermost sanctity or otherwise. 
Were you sacred when you started that riot?" 
"I can't really take credit for starting the riot. 
I just sent out the invitations. 
Everyone else started rioting. 
i thought we were demonstrating, not simply partaking in hedonistic destruction and nonsensical whimsy. 
I had no idea the statue would collapse onto the factory. 
It was designed to fall directly downward onto itself."
"The design was a fucking mess. 
From where I was standing in the crowd..."
"Perched in a tree if I remember correctly."
"Yeah, trying my best to warn the crowd of impending chaos."
"Impending?! What made you feel responsible to save the lemmings who had followed each other into a furnace? Who would perch at the gates of hell an holler at the self imposed damned? Who would think it normal to compromise the self in order to save the self destructive?"
"The idiocy of youth. 
The youthful flights of martyristic fantasy. 
That's what I came to realize. 
I had punched the cop on accident because I was knocked out by a friend I was trying to save from his own self destructive obsessions. 
You remember Timmy the Timid?" 
"Yeah, the wise guy who showed up just months after we were booked."
"He was cousin to a very good friend of mine. 
I had been trying to save my friend from the chaos of Timmy, and had instead been pulled into needless violence, the last one still in the room when the smoke cleared, and thus I ended up punching a cop, making a run for it, hiding in the crowd, trying to warn the crowd, and ending up seeming demonstrative and violent and chaotic and nonsensical. 
Truly, a martyr of my own creation. 
Now I'm here. 
I've gone through my martyr done, and I've been cured of my humanistic urges. 
We are obviously meant to avoid trying to help each other. 
A human is meant to simply survive. 
Build an alternate model. 
Not rush into the burning building and try to explain why its on fire. 
Not jump into a gang war and try to desperately reason with strangers. 
Humans do as humans do because they have been writing their fates and futures since long before they were born."
"Very deep Frank. 
You're much deeper than you ever presented yourself in prison." 
"Yes, the walls seem to limit everything human about us. 
We can't even think laterally in the proper way. 
It's a slave class. 
Now I feel like a black man who's finally gone west or north or to mexico. 
Or wherever they get equal treatment."
"Back to Africa?" 
"No, I don't think they'd be welcome there, or feel at home there anymore. 
Can you go home now? is there anyone there for you? Would anyone know you or care that you once lived in that living room and swung on that swing? I think not. 
You can try walking backwards, but you'll only fall headlong into god knows what." They had been walking for about an hour, and their jaws had loosened, and Frank was learning things about himself he hadn't been capable of considering for decades. 
It felt good. 
Like finally taking off hundred pound chains like the saints used to wear around themselves under their clothes to symbolize their allegiance to an angry and vengeful god. 
"You real think all your gibberish is going to make you feel better?" Asked papa charles.
"It already has chuck. 
It already has. 
I've left it behind, and now the words are just wind. 
Finally I'm free to look at the soft glow in the sky and the hard sparkle of the road. 
My god this road is empty. 
Less traveled to say the least."
"Yup, it's always been this vacant, although when i was you ng it was dirt."
"Oh, I remember. 
my aunt used to live up this way. 
She's long dead though. 
I remember reading her obituary about a dozen years ago. 
No offspring. 
Just a lonely old widow with no family left alive. 
My parents had both offed in a train accident four years before that. 
I remember watching the papers and feeling the universe I thought I might return to slowly disintegrating. 
It's almost freeing though. 
This idea that there is no world for me to return to. 
You know, I was planning on leaving the night before I got arrested. 
I was almost gone. 
And I suppose I had receive my release, my escape from origins and obligations, from Timmy the Timid and all the dead end highways my life was made up of back than. 
Hey! A Car!! Flag it down, will ya? You've got a nicer face than me." 
Papa Charles obliged him and turned around to start waving the car down. 
It was a dilapidated old shit wagon, and it wasn't going more than 40. 
In the shit wagon, Leroy turned to Ned and said "The ghost wants us to pick up these hitch hikers. 
He says they're crucial to the ultimate unveiling of past misdeeds." 
"He said all that?"
"I'm paraphrasing. 
he says 'pick em up they matter.'" 
"Arite Leroy, nice paraphrasing. 
Your wording has gotten much more clear since this whole ghost machine thing. 
as if having something that matters awakens your inner potential. 
I like it."
"So do I ned." The car came to a crunchling halt before the two felons who slipped happily into the back seat.
"Greetings fellow travelers." papa Charles began. 
"you have caught us at a very unfortunate time in our lives. 
Fortunate and otherwise, we have recently been released from the inmate facility ten miles back." 
"You been walking since than?" Asked Leroy.
"Yup. 
We've been in for 40 years, and everyone we ever knew is dead now." Said Frank.
"Wow! 40 years? That's immense! You must have been some gangsters back in the day." Said Ned, unaware that it might be rude to pry into the pasts of felon hitch hikers. 
"Do you guys have any buried treasure?" the ghost machine began ticker tacking before the two could respond. 
"Hang on, we're getting a message from the other side." Frank and Chuck looked at each other hesitantly, not sure if they had chosen the safest ride. 
Felons and maniacs are two similar but unrelated breeds. 
Felons break laws for reasons. 
Lunatics are just kinda flying by the seat of their delusions. 
They weren't sure they wanted to find out what sort of "other side" these two young rednecks were talking about. 
Frank started wondering if they might be headed right into some sort of ritualistic sacrifice. 
Papa Charles felt like they might be getting pulled into some sort of cult initiation. 
Both remained silent and pensive until Leroy read out the message.
"It's the ghost's name!! HE gave us his NAME!!!" Leroy called out excitedly. 
"He says "Hello boys, it's me, Pewterschmidt! Hello Pewterschmidt!  Glad to finally meet you!" Frank and Chuck had both gone pale. 
they didn't bother looking at each other, simply rooted and blindly staring forward. 
Finally Frank whispered something.
"Old Pewtie..." Ned tried to crane his neck around backwards, but Frank was directly behind him and couldn't be seen. 
Instead, Ned's eyes rested on Chuck's pale face.
"You know the ghost??!?! Are you our marching orders?!?!?" he asked excitedly. 
Leroy looked back and saw Frank's face, just as white and blank as a foggy sunrise. 
"They know the ghost?" he asked staring at Ned. 
"Yes boys, we know the ghost." Choked out Chuck. 
"He owned the factory we burned down."
"I was innocent!" protested Frank. 
"You were guilty of self sabotage, and that is all anyone is guilty of." replied chuck before continuing his explanation to the boys. 
"He owned the factory, and he built the prison where the factory once stood. 
He is what you might call our nemesis." The boys looked at each other excitedly. 
"Where's the treasure?!?!" Asked Leroy giddily. 
"We know there's buried money somewhere! Where is it?!?!"
"We don't have any treasure, you goof!" snorted Chuck. 
"I was protesting factory wages, which we weren't receiving, and Frank was just a punk teen with destructive friends. 
We had no treasure." 
"Well what about Pewterschmidt?"
"Ask him!" The machine slowly started ticking out a response. 
"F.... 
 u..... 
 c.... 
 k....." A grim silence fell upon the car as Leroy finished spelling it out. 
"Fuck your couch. 
What the hell does that mean?"
"It means he'd rather burn in purgatory for all eternity than share treasure he can no longer spend." said Frank. 
"That's how all rich people are. 
I'll bet he had all his belongings burned when he died." Frank gazed mournfully out the window, appalled that his new found freedom would immediately be imposed upon by the very bastard that stole over half his days from him. 
"Hang on it keeps going... 
he'll give us the treasure when we complete his mission." 
"But what if he disappears after we've finished his business?" asked Ned. 
"Hang on... 
he's responding... 
" The minutes seemed to hang in the air like daggers. 
"He says... 
good point. 
 That's all? What a dick!! Good point. 
He agrees. 
Well ghost, you'd better come up with some sort of plan. 
Give us some clues at least! !  we'll do your bidding! We've already driven 300 miles for you. 
We're not just gonna abandon your mission!" The silence seemed to fill the car with water. 
Everyone felt like they were drowning in anticipation. 
The car rolled on unabashedly, happily ignorant of the human inside its guts worrying and wondering about the past the future and all the tiny ways they tie together and complicate each other.
........................................
15. 
Bierbach had not awoken from his swoon, but he had calmed down. 
They had made a poultice of Valerian root which they clamped under his nostrils, and had left vitamin B pills under his tongue to calm him down, and keep his ravings to a minimum, lest he provoke enough blood flow to end himself. 
James was still off in his corner griping to himself about luck and fate and old bastard mother fucker fathers and abandoning godless prostitute mothers, and Wilson was sitting, laid back as far as his seat would go, in the cockpit of old rocky, blasting the only cd he carried, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band.. 
or something. 
The page was turning, and they were on a long and lonesome highway, though I do believe they were west of Omaha, somewhere on coast ridge road between big sur and carmel, just off the 1 about 12 miles.
Bierbach's dreams were no longer haunted by his old lover Charlotte, who also happened to be Pewterschmidt's old lover and James's mother. 
Bierbach's dreams where now haunted by his old partner, Pewterschmidt himself. 
They were walking silently through a cave that passed behind a series of waterfalls. 
There were christmas lights in the waterfalls, and cruise ships out in the ocean where the water was falling into. 
The caves seemed to be some sort of man made shindig, like a ride at disney land, made especially for the up and ups. 
it was the retreat they had planned on building one day. 
They had even gone so far as to buy up miles and miles of the big sur coast and pick out the rivers they could reroute to achieve the waterfall effect and a port that you had to sail between and behind several waterfalls to access. 
But of course it had been the seventies when they had finally gotten it all together, and they learned how resilient and pain in the ass y hippys could be, protesting of the lizards, protesting or the trees, protesting that the rocks be left as they lie, and the water trickle on instead of being used to manifest the glory of mankind and all that it can dream up and create. 
So it had fallen dormant, and there was no cave and there was no waterfalls, only the dream of it, which is where Pewtie and Bierbach were now meandering through in Bierbach's dream space and Pewtie's afterlife. 
It felt surprisingly normal to be walking with his dead partner. 
It felt like the old days. 
Even though they were both burdened with their decrepit bodies and whimpering lungs and crinkling bones and mortificating muscles. 
Pewtie put his hand on Bierbach's cane hand, and held him to a stop. 
"Alfie. 
I'm here to tell you something."
"You're here 'cause I'm asleep Pewtie." Bierbach replied.
"I'm able to be in your dreams beyond death because this is the space that the two worlds share Alfie. 
don't be so naive. 
We owned the physical world, but we did not and do not understand nor control the infinite unknown of beyond physicality." Pewtie stared deep into Alfie's eyes until Alfie became fully uncomfortable enough to accept the possibility.
"Alright, dead partner. 
I believe you. 
I believe you enough to entertain what you might have to say. 
So speak up. 
This isn't a reunion, it's a transmission. 
Am I wrong?"
"You are not wrong Alfie, if I wanted a reunion I'd visit Charlotte."
"Ah, fuck you . 
you never treated her right. 
She gave you her all, she bore your son. 
And you shunned her like a hor. 
You didn't even car that I took up with her. 
You mocked my love for her. 
No wonder James is such a little prick, being born of a woman who was mocked and maligned by his birth father. 
How can you live with yourself?!"
"I don't have to. 
I'm dead." replied Pewterschmidt. 
"Being dead means what is is, and what was was. 
There's very little else to be effected by such a disparate apparition as me. 
But I carry news, I carry necessary glorious and holy news. 
I believe it may free me from this ineffective coil if I can simply get the message and get you to believe it and get you to carry through the necessary steps to keep all the required arrangements." Alfie yanked his hand free and continued walking with the spirit a few steps behind, ironically trying to keep up. 
"Slow down Alfie. 
I still feel my physical ailments. 
You know, I can still feel my kidneys failing? But it's settled into a tolerable state, like a knife, permanently thrust in my side. 
Or a stiff back that you realize will never unstiffen. 
There is no sauna nor hot tub nor thai massage that might loosen me from this infinite coil of consequence I've been confined to."
"Get to the point Pewtie! You always were long winded."
"And you always terrified reporters and ruined our position among the locals and the workers and the church and the unions and ... 
my god you were sloppy. 
I'll bet you still are. 
But as you say, to the point. 
Your son is alive. 
Oh wait. 
That's out of order. 
You have a son! And he is alive." Alfie stopped in his tracks and slowly rotated around. 
His eyes burned furiously and his whole body stiffened. 
"You dare bring up my only wish? You dare mock me with the only hop[e I ever held aside from keeping Charlotte as one to love? My purity? My purification? You dare?!" 
"I knew you would react this way Alfie. 
I'm not lying. 
I'm not mocking you . 
I'm trying to make right what I destroyed in life. 
Your son is alive, and his name is Charles. 
he lives in the big sur mountains, hiding away from the schmucks and schmegma of modernity. 
Believe me. 
I would never mock you. 
Not from where i sit. 
I have seen hell and I have dwelt in purgatory, and I have been denied the trumpets of redemption that I felt I so richly deserved for winning in life, for taking advantage of the weak as I was taught in the capitalist style. 
I would never drag you through false hopes. 
What might that give me? What joy might I find in that?"
"The joy of one who will never have any joy again and can only find comfort in causing pain to others, especially those he could never win out over. 
You never beat me at anything except for apologizing to reporters. 
You never won anything except the privelidge of raising the offspring of Charlotte. 
You are not a man, you are not even a proper ghost, unwilling to wail and shake chains. 
A proper ghost you are, with a bad liver and failing kidneys. 
What is this, a fucking rehab afterlife? You disgust me!! There is no son. 
There is no redemption. 
Do not give me these blind ambitious ramblings of .... 
 My god, I'm talking to myself. 
You're just a figment of my subconscious, the worst thing I could possibly summon in this my possible final moments. 
I will not have it. 
I demand Charlotte back! No more Pewterschmidt! I need not yuor ironies nor painful mockings. 
Leave me to die in peace."
"Oh, Alfie. 
Just promise me that when the two rednecks and two felons show up at the scene of your crash, you will listen to them and you will follow them, and you will write a will where you leave all your riches to YOUR son, and not mine. 
James is an evil conniving wretch who would bring down destruction not just upon my own house, but upon the world. 
The factories no longer build furniture, but missiles and bullets and guns and tanks."
"That's what they've always built. 
War goods are the only stable thing in the market these days. 
War is more constant than any other social state, and to invest in something other than that is idiocy. 
We only did furniture because you can't very well have prisoners building weapons, lest they rise up and free themselves."
"James is a fool, and he will sponsor the overthrowing of countries, the way we did in south america, and he will do it wrong and recklessly, ending up in a situation where he feels compelled to launch his atomic reserve. 
You remember project bing bong? That was never canceled. 
I lied to you Alfie. 
I lied and told you it was canceled and dismantled, because I didn't want you to have access to that magical reboot the world button."

16. 
Charles had always held onto the wallet full of cash he had when he first arrived in the wilderness as a keepsake of a time past, when he lacked the resilient strength and freedom required to truly survive on his own simple gumption. 
Many a time he had pulled out the lincolnswashingtons and benjamins and contemplated their somber faces with a laughing indifference, all but forgetting the historical relevance for their monetary remembrance. 
It tickled a far corner of his brain, what might have made these few important enough to flash their stony faces in the midst of every financial exchange. 
what a strange rememberance and at long last they had once more become relevant. 
Charles remembered the last time he had passed one of these bills across a counter to be counted and filed away in the register by a pimply faced boy of sixteen in exchange for a foraging guide of the pacific mid coast. 
it had cost one hamilton and several lincolns, and he had received in exchange 300 pages of ewell gibbons, the well known survivor and student of all things wild and edible. 
Charles found it incredible that we was finally ready to return, He could barely remember why he had left. 
It had been a wednesday. 
He knew this because the marquis was being changed as he passed in front of the theater along the empty downtown strip that early morning for his final time. 
Pacific Grove had been kind to him and he felt no resentment for the pavement nor the painted parking lot lines nor the street lights or storefronts or hand painted signs. 
He had left with disdain for no man, only a strong surging mournfulness for the passing of his mother charlotte, truly the most decent person who had ever lived. 
He had helped her many a time in his youth open Barrymore Bakery. 
He'd sweep off the stoop as she made the sweet cakes that they'd sell to the regulars, old man Standish with his bristly pine cone moustache, one sugarless cookie and coffee always black, missus quince, the school marm in her subtle conservative garments garnering two dozen jelly filleds every friday to keep the kids enthused. 
Jack the plumber, steve the sweeper, fred and jerry from the hardware store next door. 
The list went on, but so did charles, on past the welcome to pacific grove sign, on along seventeen mile drive, on down past the golf course and light house and downtown carmel, into primordial landscapes that stretched through human concepts of heaven and hell. 
It had all fallen still. 
It had become a vignette without his mother Charlotte he didn't care what came next. 
He had even showed up to open the shop that morning after her death, but paused before the still locked door he couldn't bear the thought. 
So now he was gone, and now 10 years later he was on his way back. 
He had turned inward to find his mom, and no longer felt the lack. 
Without the fox to hold him near to the natural setting he had sent himself to, he was ready to wander back into the human universe. 
His dirt bike barked him along towards a futures as yet unclear. 
Perhaps back to Barrymore's to see who still held the place dear? Perhaps just find a quiet spot to lay down and die, not disturb the dirty world that seemed to be doing just fine. 
............................................................
17. 
The rednecks came around the corner unsure what to expect, sure they were getting close, because the ghost had begun acting erratic. 
The sentences were fragmented, the messages were foggy, and the rednecks and felons were getting uncomfortable. 
What had changed? Finally Leroy asked...
"Whats the matter ghost? You got all quiet! You got all stuttery! what's the matter?" The ghost slowly began to tack out a response, and soon Leroy was reading it back. 
"There's a crash coming up. 
slow down ned. 
This is where we're supposed to be. 
It's a man named Bierbach, and ... 
don't be afraid of the man with horns? What the hell could that mean?!?!" The felons and rednecks all exchanged worried glances. 
Than leroy continued. 
"He was visiting his partner's dream, and that's why he got fuzzy for a minute. 
Oh look, there's the crash!! Doesn't look too bad." the shit wagon pulled up behind the shiny black Lincoln and red rx7. 
They could see an old man on the hood of the red car, and a young man off to the side with his head in his hands. 
They couldn't see wilson yet because he was blocked by the old man on the hood. 
They all got out quickly and suddenly it was quite a party. 
There was quite a bit of noise, especially when the felons recognized Bierbach. 
and Wilson jumped out of the car, his horns shining aggressively.
PART TWO :: THE CHASE
CHAPTER ONE :::
Jasper the Extractor hires Jack the Slacker.
-     -     -
“It’s a shitshow jack. 
You can’t fix it, you can’t fake it into anything better than it is. 
It’s a production featuring biological byproducts in unprescedented variety and intensity. 
What else would you call this? There’s a fucking lack of humanity about the whole thing. 
These people just don’t make any sense to me. 
We have been put on this planet, you and I jack. 
We’ve been put on this planet to fix things. 
To eradicate the weedy types. 
The invasive. 
The poisonous. 
Our only calling is to be discerning and ruthless. 
Pity is for those believers who think that turning the other cheek will somehow pay off in the afterlife. 
We are not here to protect the afterlife. 
We are here to protect what we currently have. 
How can an afterlife be kind to someone who didn’t give a shit about life itself? Isn’t the sequal gonna be some how tied to the prequel? Isn’t there some level of consequence to letting the ship go down? To letting the shit pile up? To letting the shift occur without any preparations for transition? These people don’t believe in the same kind of consequence that we do Jack, and it’s not because they’ve transcended Newtonian physics. 
Cause and effect still matter in our day to day lives, even if its only a metaphor for what’s really going on in the spiritual realm. 
We can’t just sit around and swallow the mess they’ve prepared for us. 
We may not have children, but we are obligated to do what we can to prepare a future that might better serve what children there are that haven’t been packaged produced and traumatized into automaton blockage ridden rodents. 
You get what I’m sayin jack? Am I talking slow enough for ya? Ho! Jack! Snap out of it!! No response. 
What a monkey. 
You just can’t find good help in this city. 
Ah well. 
This job interview is over.” The portly hunched over hermit faced radical pushed his bar stool back, slapped a twenty on the bar, and slipped on his jacket. 
“Hey Jasper. 
One for the road.” He called to the bartender, and picked up his suitcase. 
Jasper slid up and served a double shot of well whiskey which the stubble chinned cynic slammed back in a quick gulp before glancing at Jack, who had his head in his arms on the bar, apparently passed out mid job interview. 
The cynic stepped out the door into the howling snow of Chicago without so much as a howdeedoo.
With the sound of the door slinching shut, Jack sat upright and looked around with eyes that had obviously been awake the whole time. 
He didn’t even bother rubbing them. 
He just looked at Jasper, and said “Damn, you know that guy?” Jasper smiled and slid Jack a beer. 
”Nope, but you sure do seem to pull them in. 
Why do they always walk up to you and demand that you join their underground network of life changing radicals Jack? Do you post stuff online or something?” Jack shrugged his shoulders and sipped his beer.
“I haven’t got a fuckin clue Jass.. 
I guess I just come off as someone who cares and wants to help but doesn’t want to deal with bull shit. 
Ironically that makes me a bull shit magnet. 
I swear to god Jass, the FBI should hire me just to pull these psychos out of the shadows and into some level of conversation. 
He was offering me a job!! Did you hear that?”
“I heard him Jack. 
I’m not sure it was the type of work you wanna be doing though. 
Erasing shit, or cleaning up incompetence… It all sounded rather vague and threatening.”
“Yeah, cloak and dagger, except more along the lines of … fuckin trench coat and poison dart. 
I guess that’s the same thing though.”
”Yeah, I liked the guy in the poncho last week. 
He really got going.” Jasper added.
“Oh, right! He wanted to just cart me off, in the middle of my passed out drunk act. 
He thought that was perfect for his gang! God, that group must be a mess. 
You ever see them in the papers or anything?”
“Actually, yes. 
His name was Horatio Mozambique. 
Obviously a fake name, they picked him up dressed as a woman, robbing a convenience store. 
He was holding them up, and got held up by the clerk who gave him the money, but couldn’t get the guy’s cigarettes right. 
Armed robbery, but got distracted mid swipe. 
Fuckin goobers!”
“Fuckin goobers. 
But I need a job Jass. 
This series of random ne’er d’wells is fun and all, but how the crap can I ever get paid if the only people who want to hire me are incompetent fringer maniacs who either want to use painted rocks for money or think they’ll get paid once they overthrow the government or some such?”
“Funny you should ask, Jack. 
I this last guy? He left us a clue. 
And he seemed … uh… disturbed enough for us to go extract what payment you deserve for tolerating his come on.” Jass slid the twenty that the guy had paid with across the bar to Jack. 
“He left his address. 
I assume it was accidental. 
Or maybe he thinks you’re perfect for the job.” Jack picked up the bill and studied it.
“127 West Ambition Boulevard, apartament C15. 
Sounds charming. 
What do you suggest we do?”
“I’ve got… a set up. 
I used to be part of… a group.” Jack’s jaw dropped.
“You?!?! JASSper!! I’m shocked. 
What was your enemy? The rich? The angry? The whites?” Jasper shook his head, almost embarrassed.
“We were after the bankers. 
We found out how to slip out enough dirt on whoever was being … less than moral. 
We started by targeting slum lords in the late 80s. 
Than we moved onto mortgage banks, and by the end of the nineties we were dumping info on up and up ceo types in companies I dare not mention in such mixed company.” Jack looked around the empty dive bar. 
Not a soul was there.
”Yea, your Tuesday afternoon crowd probably wouldn’t appreciate it.” Said jack. 
Jasper smiled.
“Yeah, I don’t trust anyone or anything Bud. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if every weirdo sent in here to pester you was actually after me, dropping bugs in the ash trays and wires in the water closet. 
I don’t talk here.”
“Not even with the water running?” Asked Jack, mildly mocking, but with all due respect and poise. 
”Not even with the water running.” Replied Jasper. 
“so when do you wanna hit this guy?”
“I don’t wanna hit him. 
I just wanna… well, maybe I’ll hit him, but with something soft, like a pillow. 
Not with a baseball bat. 
Not with a hammer. 
Not even if it’s the hammer of justice. 
It’s just not my style. 
Let every man bury himself is my motto.” 
”Well that’s cute Jack, but I’m serious. 
Lets fuck this guy around a bit. 
We can just do little things, like donate his entire bank account to a soup kitchen, or turn his social media life into a complete nightmare, have him come out of the closet as the first gay isis member who’s planning on voting for trump. 
Come on Jack, it’s fun! And that guy was a creep!” 
”We don’t know that guy Jass. 
You can’t just assume people are shitty just because they act that way. 
What if he had a shitty childhood or a shitty day or he just went for a shitty walk.”
“Than by continueing to spread the shittiness, he has aligned himself with the shit side, and we as good upstanding denizens of this fair burrough are obligated by the unwritten social contract to take out the trash and keep these streets clean and safe for the children, even if they aren’t ours.. 
what was it he said about that?”
“Arite Jass, I’m in. 
We goin tonite? What do we do, park across the street and send up drone cameras and drone mosquitos?”
“I do have a drone mosquito. 
FUUUCK!! I talked about it in the bar. 
 We’re fucked. 
We gotta go.” Jass seemed extremely serious. 
He leaped over the bar and bolted the front door. 
Already there were unseen people bashing against the other side. 
“Do it movin Jack, we’re on the run! That’s them outside!!”
”That’s who?!”
”The people I knew had been watching me. 
And that leech that was bugging you obviously bugged the bar as well, and they’ve been outside across the street, probably in a bakery van or a box truck or something, monitoring us, waiting for me to slip up.” He said all this while leading Jack to the back of the bar, to the mens room, to the window, to the fire escape, up and up and up, they clacked along the metal steps. 
“They’ve been coming here for years and years now. 
Every shit mouthed dissident that has spoken to you, I have no doubt was an agent.”
“How can you say that Jass?” Jack seemed offended that none of the eccentrics had been genuine.
“Because I used to work for them!! I helped them start up!! We were a great team. 
Me and Stan the sleeper, and Pete the snake, and Jerry the…” 
”JACKALOPE!!” Jack offered, hopeing to have guessed Jerry’s handle.
“No, not Jackalope. 
Jerry the Jig man. 
He did things with puzzles. 
You’re a normie and wouldn’t get it if I explained it to you for a week. 
We were the best. 
We may have been the only, though I’ve heard of similar groups that did similar things for similar kicks, and I’m sure they all killed off the one guy in the group who didn’t want to work for multi-conglomorate corporations. 
I got into it for the puzaz. 
The info. 
The edge. 
Also, we actually helped people. 
And the rush of it, being so rare and forward… man, girls were everywhere. 
I don’t know when nerds became sexy, but I know I was there when they did. 
And than, when nerds became evil workers for the big money grubbers, the fat cats and war pigs, I slipped off, changed cities, gained about a hundred pounds, changed my name, and haven’t touched a computer since.”
“How long’s it been?”
“12 years.”
“HOLY SHIT! That’s fuckin wild Jass. 
You happy now? You like your life as a dive bar tender? I mean, I’m your only friend!!” They had finally made it to the roof and they were both out fo breath. 
Jass leaned over wheezing, Jack crouched beside him doing the same. 
Jass looked up offended. 
”You’re not my ONLY friend Jack. 
I have a fish. 
AND a cat.” Jack’s eyes widened. 
He hadn’t meant to strike so close to home. 
He didn’t actually believe he was Jass’s only friend, and now that it seemed true, he realized he had finally accidentally taken one of the infinite number of bizarre job opportunities that always crawled in and sat next to him at the bar at Jasper’s on 4th and Bradbury. 
..................................
2. 
"You need to sleep Charlie. 
That's all. 
Just find somewhere relaxing to lie down and forget the tumult in the forest of your brain. 
There is a time to clear cut the landscape, and this might be it. 
You know the future is not the past. 
You know you've modified your vision and your patterns and your aggressive reactions. 
You know things. 
You're not just a babe in the woods anymore. 
You can stand up and you can take it. 
You're scared of being destroyed by life again. 
You're scared the only thing you love will be taken once more. 
But you've survived it twice. 
First your mother, and second your fox friend. 
You can't continue to live in fear of loss. 
You must live in joy of what is. 
 ot in fear of what might be."
"My dreams though. 
My dreams are ruthless and more real than this waking life. 
I cannot explain to you how much more believable the things I see at night are. 
They rise up like dragons, they rear back their heads like hydras. 
There's no escaping these thoughts!" Charlie continued to paw his hands together as if they were covered in fur and wax. 
He was obviously very unsettled by his return to civilization. 
He was not ready nor willing. 
His departure from the wilderness had been just as sudden and unprepared as his initial voyage into the wilds. 
Now, he was back at the bakery, talking to the woman who had taken over after his mother Charlotte had died. 
He had known this woman in his youth, she had been the school marm back than. 
He had considered her a friend, but back than a friend was simply another stranger who smiled as he handed them their order. 
He had never set foot in her classroom, being strictly home schooled. 
He had never passed any small talk with her. 
he had never felt connected or related or obligated to her. 
But now, here she was, listening to him pour out his heart.
He had showed up right as she was closing, and was shocked when she recognized him. 
She quickly ushered him inside and asked him where he'd been and how he had enjoyed it, and whether he brought back any realizations that he might wish to share wit the world. 
First of all though, she had asked him to please relieve himself of the obvious pain and fear that was plaguing him so heavily. 
He hadn't meant to unload so gushingly and grossly, but had quickly felt his flow build up and wave after wave of sentences and subjects come crashing down and out of his mouth. 
"Go on, give in. 
let it all dump out. 
Start by just telling yourself to do just that. 
say it. 
Go on, give in. 
Let glory reign down. 
try it. 
repeat it until you feel your inner mind release the things you're terrified of sharing. 
You can feel better you will feel better. 
Please Charlie. 
I loved your mother Charlotte, and though I didn't know you, I loved you simply because you had been Charlotte's jewel. 
Tell me everything Charlie. 
Don't be scared. 
Don't be sad. 
You're here with me. 
Consider me family." Charlie had simply sat sullen and slack jawed, obviously overwhelmed by being indoors for one, for being spoken to for second, and by finding someone who apparently cared seemed to be the lynch pin which left him stark and mute. 
the school marm had simply poured him some coffee and reapproached him with a warm biscuit, inviting him to stay on her couch for a bit while he regained his footing and got ready to be part of society again. 
Back at her house charlie had seemed more relaxed, spending a lot of time in her garden, studying the bugs and stroking the leaves of her drooping willow tree. 
He laid with his head under the ferns in the corner by the bamboo fence and when she came out with lemonade and a ham sandwich he was whistling a nonsense tune, watching the ferns dance with his breath. 
the school marm was happy to see him finally relaxed, gently approached and sat next to him.
"Charlie? I know you're hurt and scared. 
10 years is a long time to live in the wilderness. 
I'm sure it was beautiful there." Charlie nodded with a soft grin. 
"I'm also sure it was full of heavy truths and constant reminders that life is made of both growth and decay, both blossoms and death." Charlie's grin disappeared and he nodded again. 
"I want you to be ready to face the world before you leave here Charlie, and I want to be sure you're not going to be overwhelmed, so I'm going to share something with you I feel may be a bit too much for you. 
But you've seen truth, for that's what nature carries in its face. 
You've seen the harshness and the darkness and the immensity of the horizon, and I believe you will understand what I'm going to show you." Charlie's eyebrows raised in concerned interest. 
"It's my husband's suicide note Charlie. 
He was a good man, he loved me very well. 
He did his best. 
But drinking got the best of him, and he lived in a trauma that I was not able to wash away. 
He chose his trauma over the option of starting anew with me." Charlie frowned, and a tear dripped down his cheek. 
School marm put out a finger and picked up the tear. 
"This is a feeling you're having. 
That is all. 
You will get through this feeling, and you will emerge on the other side stronger, but only if you decide to become stronger and to gain supremacy over it. 
You understand Charlie? When it's dark and raining you can't just curl up in a ball in the rain and cry yourself to sleep. 
You'll die there." Charlie nodded. 
"You have to get up. 
Movement causes blood flow. 
Choices cause new possibilities. 
Faith causes hope. 
Do you understand?" Charlie nodded and squeezed his eyes shut. 
"I want you to read my husbands final words, because they represent a head space he was unable or unwilling to escape, and I believe you have the strength and purity to escape such a doldrum darkness. 
You are not immobile. 
You are a building working growing thriving spirit that is currently struggling with feelings. 
That is all. 
They will pass, because you will choose to gain agency over your own realm. 
Your own emotions. 
your own beliefs. 
Are you ready? Would you like to read the words that represent something I hope you never become?" Charlie's eyes were streaming tears, and he sat up rubbing his eyes and nodding.
"I'm sorry maam. 
I don't deserve this attention. 
I ran away. 
Why would you love me like this? You don't even know me!"
"I knew your mother, and I know what sort of a child she raised, and I know what sort of man that child could and has grown into. 
Now here, buck up, get ready for some darkness, but know that on the other side of this there is a life. 
There is love, and there is hope. 
These are thoughts you are meant to identify and leave behind." Charlie forced a smile, and took the crinkled tear stained paper from her, and began reading. 
"Thinking it out will never work. 
Going by facts from the past will only hurt. 
Accusing and questioning only will strain it til all parties cease the refrain. 
Wondering and watching will cause stoppages. 
Analyzing and trying to guess will cause ulcers and panic attacks. 
Let it lie, let it die. 
Let it be what it is for now and wait for it to come clear. 
The worried voices in your head only bring fear and you know you are glad to be here,  There's always a problem, there's always a crux and a crisis anew question a problem to be poked at a conundrum to throttle and another reason to return to the bottle and drift into less than care. 
For shame. 
For pitiable uncorrectable games you play only with yourself locked in the cabinet of your own mind. 
Too many clues. 
Always too much to ever let loose. 
And long ago you cast off your instincts and spiritual guard. 
You retard your growth with such messy flawed flopping shit stained brick house prick what might give us confidence?  Nothing can cleanse you of your well earned scars except saying something immediate heavy and dark. 
With what fears do you fondle your inner pissant and how can you drop it ten thousand stories down to the sidewalk to shatter like glass, this porcelain lie held forever at half mast in remembrance of all things past. 
I cannot abide in this dark eternal question, with feet dragging past gestapo bastard punk shit farce of how you live... 
Go on, give it all. 
Let glory reign down. 
Howl sad and untrusting the mournful hound of pitiable pausery. 
No guts no shits no honor no glory. 
Feel it all start to shatter and ponder perhaps if you caused all the clatter that dances in your eardrums and screams banshee accusations just simple quip and a problem seemingly unfixable. 
Is it trauma or truth? Is the brain this far gone? Can we come back from the maddening laugh that leaves us forlorn? Is there no respite from self imposed fear that crawls into all moments and compromises donations of joyful encasements in fates that we crave? We start with faith. 
This turns into ignoring anything reeking of fakeness, long pauses, slow responses, stuttering shit shifting quickening in one fearful daytime realization never written down, if we ignore every clue there's no way to know and no place to go to be sure that we are where we thought we had hoped for and even as the creature sits slimy and heavy upon our chest we are not given options to guess what's next, only clues and hints that eternally fall past our visage of confidence clawing at hope shining there at the top of the rope we've neglected to climb, and finally stepping swiftly out of our mind we find canyons and craters, mistakes to be made, long walks into unguessable fact checker faster than anything real or believable do we keep our assumptions of generic functions found in lazy predisposed fuckery or is there a higher road that everyone has the chance to ho on and will o so willingly laughing not desperately, drinking not darkly, fucking not wildly, is there? Is there a higher ground?"
Charlie had been sobbing since about halfway through, fully understanding how this poor man had simply surrendered to all of his fears, pitying the poor bastard who had chosen to remain too weak to truly stand and find the sun and appreciate the glow. 
Upon finishing it, Charlie felt a strong and warm burst of sunlight caressing his face. 
He stood up and looked into the sky, feeling baptized. 
It had worked. 
The suicide note had embodied his fears in such a way that he was able to simply accept the fact that love is always paired with the fear of loss, purity with the fear of flaw, and life with the fear of death. 
To walk with eyes open meant to stand up and walk, and not count clues, and not count reasons to fear, and not count all the other miserable people who couldn't summon enough courage to truly love, to truly live. 
Charlie quickly ran to the school marm and embraced her. 
"Thank you maam. 
You have given me more strength and hope than I thought were available. 
I can never thank you enough. 
You may not have cured me, but you have given me the cure to self administer, and I promise you, I will smile forever when i see you. 
I will smile forever when I think of you. 
I will smile forever whenever anyone else demonstrates these truths you have given me." And with that, Charlie walked out the gate and back into pacific grove, off to find some unguessable future. 
He would be back to visit her, but he felt more compelled to find out what his own trajectory might hold, and to bring her back proof of his new capacity for faith and vigilant joy.

3. 
"ALRIGHT!!! ENOUGH!!! NOT ANOTHER WORD OR YOU"RE ALL GOING TO JAIL!!" Hollered Jack. 
Dan looked over at his partner and gave him an approving nod. 
Finally, putting his angst to good use; controlling these maniacs. 
"You guys obviously don't get along, but you've never even met, but you're all intertwined somehow, and hold some ancient resentments. 
I can't follow this. 
Dan! Help me out here. 
We're gonna separate the groups into who gets along, and interview them one at a time until we have some sort of idea what in God's name is going on here. 
Now where do we start? Who's got the beginning? Who here thinks they know how this whole shit show was triggered?" Dan had begun herding the groups away from each other, Papa Charles and Frank with Ned and Leroy, none of them were yelling at each other. 
Though Leroy seemed pretty mad at this computer device as it continued to blink out some sort of pattern. 
Wilson and Bierbach and James Pewterschmidt all seemed to get along, so the two cops split up and interviewed the two groups separately. 
Twenty minutes later they returned to the quiet space between the groups, right in the middle of the cruiser, the lincoln, the rx7 and the shit wagon. 
There, they exchanged a story neither of them were sure they liked, but all the pieces seemed to line up all right. 
"Alright Jack, what did you get from the Felons and the Rednecks?" Dan said, scratching his head and examining the notes he had taken. 
"You'll love it Dan. 
I tell you, it'll be a hollywood movie. 
so Check it out. 
Over there we have Papa Charles and Franky. 
They've been in the old P&B Penal Colony for 40 years. 
They were both locked up for burning down the P&B Furniture factory which was replaced with the prison, so they were imprisoned in the same building they used to work, and the prison kept making furniture, so they got to keep their jobs, they just stopped getting paid, and could never leave. 
The perfect factory." 
"Hey, that's what the old guy said! The one with the head injury. 
He said he's the B from P&B, and his dead partner... 
P, had just visited him in a dream and warned him about rednecks and felons." 
"Aw shit. 
Was his partner named Pewterschmidt?"
"You got it. 
And that's the son of Pewterschmidt. 
the scrawny pale one. 
Not the guy with horns. 
Why? Someone in your camp mention Pewtie?" 
"You even got the nickname. 
Yup. 
The two rednecks are ghost hunters, and they've got Pewtie on the line. 
The ghost told them to pick up the felons, and they were supposed to find the scene of the crash."
"So that all kinda makes sense... 
i guess, but what's with beelzebub?" 
"You interviewed him. 
What did he say?"
"He said he got in an accident, and people think he's the devil."
"You don't get horns from an accident."
"Nah, he was born with the horns. 
he's just stuck here with these wahoos because he crashed into the old timer and the creep."
"So we got old timer, creep, wierdo, rednecks and felons."
"And a ghost."
"oh right. 
how could I forget." 
"So now that we've cleared all that up... 
what in the fuck is our job?" 
"Keep the peace."
"Well, we've got a temporary cease fire between all parties. 
Did we sort out why everyone hates each other?"
"The old timer hates the creep just because he's a ... 
blood sucking prick, I think were the words he used. 
And the creep hates the rednecks, because their ghost says that the old timer has a son, which compromises the creep's inheritance. 
Also, the ghost is the father of the creep, so that's a bummer for creep. 
Outed by his own dead pops."
"Rough."
"And the devil guy hates everyone except the felons, because the felons don't think he's satan. 
They say his eyes are too soft and brown. 
Apparently Satan has harsh blue eyes." 
"Wow! We're getting some useful information out of these lunatics. 
We really ought to jot this all down and sell it to steven sodorburg or whatever the crap his name is."
"So why does the ghost want the felons here?"
"I didn't interview the ghost! what you think I'm trying to encourage these maniacs?"
"Arite, so the felons just happen to be hitch hiking, and end up at the scene of a crash where the author of their incarceration lays bleeding from the head, and... 
godamn that guy with horns. 
He is just soooo distracting. 
Every time I think we're getting somewhere, I start to wonder what the hell he's doing here."
"Apparently he was just going for a drive. 
And the creep was driving the old timer to the airport to fly to hawaii for some R&R."
"And the rednecks are playing ouiji board, and it just so happened to get them somewhere relevant. 
So remind me again what the hell our job is." Jack looked down at the ground and kicked at the gravel. 
"Arrest the felons, take the rich old guy to the hospital, and lecture the rednecks and abandon the guy with horns."
"What about the creep?"
"He'll demand to be taken with his uncle, who's not even his blood relative. 
"
"Does the old timer get a say?"
"Shit yeah! Lets hope he says to ditch the creep. 
Wouldn't that be beautiful?" Having made their deliberations and chosen to do the easy thing, protect the rich, ditch the creeps, arrest the felons again, for old time sake, and feel good about it, they approached the old timer to start the sequence of events that would hopefully lead to this 4 car chaos scene being wrapped up and deported to somewhere less unmarred by human absurdity.
The old man was sitting up on the hood of the RX7 with his chin in his hands, staring out at the tumultuous pacific.
",Alright Bierbach, you need a hospital. 
You're still bleeding, and all that yelling was giving you obvious fainting spells."
“Well you take me! Don’t let him come.” He said, pointing at James. 
“The whole thing was his fault!” Which obviously wasn’t true, but he simply could not pass up an opportunity to torture James in any small way. 
James gave a pinched smile and closed his eyes. 
Wilsonobserved the reaction, and did not smile.
Dan loaded the whiney old timer into the front passenger seat of the cruiser, and they took off towards the hospital, leaving Jack the cop to try and wrangle these 6 bizarre strangers well met on a deserted mountainside highway. 
Jack wasn’t sure who he liked least, the creep or the two felons or the two rednecks or the guy with the horns. 
It was all pretty evenly matched. 
He slowly let his eyes wander across the crowd, and all quicky like, but not necisarrily sudden, rather a slow fade into suddenly (dammit!!!! THAT WORD HAUNTS ME!!!)(pardon the narrator. 
He struggles with repetitive word choices, especially now that his wordcounter tells him his most overused words) And so there Jack the cop was, looking over this motley crew of undesirables. 
He immediately felt absolutely no obligation towards any of them. 
These are all adults. 
What can one officer of the law do against a pulsating mass of hysteria? THAT guy has HORNS!!! What the FUCK! It might be a hollywood thing. 
Maybe he’s doing a movie around here. 
Alright. 
Whatever. 
But what about the felons? They most likely would not be opposed to dumping the body of a cop in the big sur mountains and than disappearing into the hills and wilderness. 
Calm down jack. 
You’re just kinda wierded out by this whole thing.
Jack looked up at the sky and let out a long sigh before turning around and approaching the two groups. 
Finally, he felt ready to let what happen may. 
Or . 
Yeah. 
So he walked over, and stood between the two groups, and he just.. 
yelled out…
“KILL THE NARRATOR!!!”
and one of the rednecks was like “Yeah!! I’m pretty sure he’s fuckin stoned!!” and the whole group of them started cheering and jumping around like maniacs. 
They fuckin loved it.
“KILL THE NARRATOR!!!” They all cried, unabashed, suddenly fascinated by this bizarre discovery that THEY them FUCKING SELVES!!! Were nothing more than Pieces of Fiction. 
Mere scraps in a dime fucking store novel. 
A pocket piece of hickory smoked shit my biscuit loving friend. 
And they looked at each other with new eyes. 
The felons felt wave after wave of this bizarre realization wash over them. 
Their entire histories had been fictions. 
There had been no prison, no time, no protest riots nor timmy the timid or whiskey to rile the workers. 
It had all been simply nonsense from this fuckin kook on the other side of the screen. 
Oh, look at him. 
He’s so bashful. 
 Hiding behind these soldier letters forming these batillion words. 
It’s quite like watching toy soldiers being lined up and one by one knocked over accompanied by the childish sound of “KapOWW KapOWWW!!!”
And so, as in the previous example, our beautiful mournful cast of characters is about to be given a chilling reminder, and that is… If one is fictitious and one becomes aware of it, one is still obligated to follow the rules of fiction, which are a subjugation in accordance with the will of a much stronger power, and this power shall be known heretofore to all men, as eternal benefactor of we the fictitious believers and worshipers of the glorious and merciful whims of what godhead we refer to refers to himself as author. 
What I mean is, these little bastard characters have stopped respecting me. 
They’re making demands, see? So I gotta flex a bit of muscle and remind ‘em what it’s like to learn who GOD is. 
See? Aaaaaaahhh... 
All of a sudden, a Golden Goat came barreling out into teh group and stood bleating and staring slack jawed at the group of hollering humans. 
Every character fell silent and looked embarresedly at the fictitious goat, suddenly aware of their puny insignificance in the face of an uncreated future. 
All at once the goat exploded, showering the party with goat blood and goat guts and such. 
They all looked down at their feet, sudden'y feeling very silly, and no longer judging the narrator for his blatant overuse of the modifier "suddenly."
................................
4. 
No one had seen or herd from ancient harold since he had locked up his apartment and signed up for Safeway grocery deliveries. 
After you get all that, there''s never a reason to leave. 
He simply answered the door once a week and handed them a billfold before carting the groceries inside. 
 othing more. 
it was glorious. 
He felt like technology had finally caught up with human potential, and he was surfing that magnificent and glorious wave that led from ancient pioneerism to the most intentional of evolutions. 
He often felt a bit guilty that he spent 14 of his 16 waking hours playing video games, but he was getting paid, and that was like a job, and that meant all the health side effects and psychological, malfunctions and social crippledness was all very much worth the trade. 
Harold was not willing to question his approach,a dn what he had accepted as a normal way to live, because he felt that the lord on high had given him the mind to accept and pursue the things he did because he was obligated as one infinitely small among an infinitely large test case. 
9 billion at a time, one would end up tapping into the crucial inevitable unnameable future of mankind, and Harold thought that there was always the small tiny off chance that it was the silly shit that he had decided was the most normal way to approach a normal human existence. 
He lifted his blinds a scratch and peer ed out to see what those hoodlums were doing next door. 
They had been making a lot of extra noise as of late, and no one was willing to chase them out, as far as Harold knew, but Harold knew absolutely no one from the immediate neighborhood. 
He'd been the suburban hermit for less than a year, and was still waiting for people to cause a horrible pain in his side, and this large woman in the double wide with her seeming infinite influx and outflux of young ruffian looking hoodlum types. 
Harold had kept a detailed registry of the undoccumented guests that frequented Aunt Dezzie's place, for that is the neighbor he had been surruptitionsly lurking on. 
The constant flow of couch crashers were some of the many random young travelers that Ned and leroy and Jeff and all the other boys had ended up befriending in their years lounging aroudn the down town, which ended up keeping the perpetual passing through of various folk who always stopped by to visit aunt Dezzie and drop off or pick up any number of tidbits and garments and hoo haw and jibby jawby for all the whatnot that anyone could ever possibly feel obligated to jave any sort of interest in hooby gooby nana joomangaroo.

5. 
Jack and the Crash
Eventually, Jack had decided that the best way to control the situation was to befriend the wild cards, so that they'd be more likely to fall in your favor, so he started with the strongest looking wild card, in case they all ended up being wild cards/ This happened to be Frankie, and it didn't take long for Jack to inadvertently trigger Frank's resistance to blue uniforms on anyone ever, and in an effort to control his aggression, Frankie had accidentally become ... 
emotional. 
"I was not assaulting or attacking the old bASTARD!" he said, defending his behavior when the cops had arrived. 
"I was simply informing him that he had ruined my life! I wasn't MAKING him hyperventilate. 
I wasn't even aware he was hurt. 
We got here AFTER the crash. 
We weren't part of it." Seeing old Beirbach had brought back all the resentment and frustration stewing in his gut. 
He had felt 19 and unduly assaulted once more by officers of the law, come to compromise his innocence and wreak havoc on his sensitivities. 
All at once his felon shell had crumbled away upon seeing the miser whining the miser in the midst of his blood loss fainting spell, and these two rural blue shirts had only aggravated his outburst with their obvious oppressive authoritarian presence. 
"And now you two have sided with the miser and have come to take me back for assault. 
I won’t!  I can’t!! Two thirds of my life has been gray death meant for men I have no relation to. 
Now, four hours free, and I'm back in the grip of the gutless blue back mafia, come to prove that all felons go back. 
Well if this is the corporate sponsored shit house this fair country has grown into than send me back! The only thing I've cherished about the stone box you buried me in is the straightforwardness. 
The honesty. 
I'm Frankie, but you call me mister Macintosh. 
Hide yourselves behind the label. 
Don't expose yourself to me by calling me by my more intimate of names, Frankie. 
All you, all but... 
no of all.... 
we can..." Frank suddenly began sobbing. 
Jack had stepped back and looked around at Papa Charlie who didn't seem to notice, still with his eyes attached to the horizon, a cheery calm expression on his face.
Jack was entirely unclear as to how his first attempt at befriending the wild card had gone. 
He went and sat by Papa Charles, now hoping to befriend the most reasonable acting wild card. 
Dan would be gone for at least an hour, and Jack was far from comfortable with his situation. 
“So, you and Frankie over there, eh? You guys partners or something?”
“Not even close.” Responded Papa Charles, his facial expression unwavering, his eyes eternally camped on the eternal ocean. 
“We met in prison. 
We served time for the same crime only I did it and he didn’t.”
“The time or the crime?”
“The crime. 
He did the time right along side of me. 
40 years. 
But he was just a punk teenager back when we burned down the factory. 
He had no part of our demonstration.”
“So why are you guys at the scene of a crash with the guy who owns your old prison?” Charles finally looked over at Jack with a gleam in his eye.
“Aint it the strangest thing?” he asked, all asparkle. 
“Those rednecks picked us up a few hours after we were released. 
And in less than a couple hours of them driving, we come upon this scene!! Oh, but the best part. 
There’s a ghost.”
“I recall someone hollering about the ghost.”
“It’s the old guy’s dead partner. 
He wants something, but we haven’t been able to establish what.”
“So the rednecks have a ghost?”
“No, the ghost is free. 
They just have a ghost machine to talk to him.”
Behind a rock, James Pewterschmidt’s eavesdropping ears gave his eyes a reason to light up. 
Could it possibly be that these hoodlum rural know nothings had a machine with which James could speak to his dead father? He decided what he must do. 
Extortion is never an easy business. 
James had work to do, and he quickly ambled over to the pair, calm as a cucumber, cool as a windless ocean. 
He plopped his butt down next to Leroy and Ned who were rolling cigarettes and studying the machine which gave an occasional ticka tack, but nothing consistent or regular or pattern related.
“Now aint this a shit show.” He offered, trying to seem …. 
Colloquial. 
“I never been this stranded before. 
How bout you guys?”
“Well, there was the time we forgot to bring a compass when we went looking for the elephant graveyard. 
WE were lost for .. 
what was it, three days?” Leroy nodded in agreement as Ned continued the story. 
“We lived off of bark and stinging nettle. 
On the second night we caught a tree frog, but it made us all hallucinate, and we may have found a road, but we were too high to stay and hitch hike, so we ended up getting lost again trying to avoid the road because we thought it might be haunted or controlled by a less than benevolent spirit.” James’s eyes were wide. 
It made him look a lot less roachy and slimy. 
Ned was half tempted to continue his bull shittery, but decided it wasn’t as entertaining as it had begun. 
This poor guy is just a rich city idiot who would die in a day out here. 
No sense in leading him down the bramble path to point out the shadow of death for him to see wherever he looks. 
He let his story peter out, and they all gazed towards the water. 
Finally James spoke.
“So has the ghost offered you a reward yet?”
“Nope. 
Not a thing. 
He says there’s a resort out here that we can find if we manage to relay a message to the old timer, but he never got around to explaining himself. 
Once we got here he fell silent. 
Or, we weren’t able to interpret it, ‘cause everyone was yelling at each other. 
What was your name again?” James was suddenly caught in a question. 
Should he reveal himself? Should he tell them that he is the son of the ghost? Would these rednecks respect that as giving him rights to any information the ghost might be trying to relay? His father had always been petty and rude to him, so he assumed it would be in the afterlife. 
“What do you think it is that he wants?”
“It seems to be about money. 
He doesn't want someone to get it, but we haven't established who. 
We think it's someone rela.... 
wait. 
Who are you?" Pewtie Junior stumble bumbled out an awkward,
"I'm... 
Dennis. 
A family friend. 
I take care of the old guy. 
After all, he needs SOMEone to look after him." The two rural boys looked at each other unsure as James continued trying to eek into their trusting side. 
"You know, that old Pewterschmidt, he never was a good guy. 
He had some of the most heinous unkind ruthless schemes. 
you wouldn't believe. 
I tell you, if we treat him right .talk to him proper through that machine, I'll bet he'll roll over for us, and tell us where the treasure is buried." James concluded. 
Leroy jumped up excitedly.
"So there is treasure!" He yelled, and walked towards James. 
"What is it, and how do we convince the ghost to talk?"
"There hasn't been a message since all the noise started. 
Once we were all yelling at each other, he stopped transmitting. 
He hasn't made a sound since." Ned looked wearily down at the machine, suddenly torn by the thought that it might have been nothing more than the fantastical fanatical flights of fancy that no one else would ever believe and he may have never even experienced, only seeing what he wanted throughout. 
But Morse Code is morse code. 
It's a language, and letters transmitted through it are just as unique and unquestioningly a message or gibberish. 
It must have been real. 
The ghost has simply fallen silent to see how we manage to sort this scene out amongst ourselves. 
Maybe the ghost is only allowed to bring people together, but incapable of taking part once he's caused the initial trigger and catalyst to meet. 
All these thoughts went through Ned's mind as Leroy and James continued to grill each other over what the ghost had said versus what sort of enterprises Pewtie Senior had been rpone to according to James, Now Dennis's memory. 
James had changed his name for no good reason, because they wouldn't know that Pewtie had a son named James, so we will return to calling him James, and the name Dennis will be stricken from the records as simply an unnecisarry complication with no pay off. 
Let it be hereby remembered that to give a character a name is a finalizing thing, and we must not become distracted by small ideas to change one person's name, because nobody cares that much. 
If you have two characters named Jack by accident, make sure it's Jack the Cop and Jack the Slacker, or something equally as dichotomous. 
So James returns to his truest moniker, abandoning the name Dennis, because the ghost tells the boys.
"WAIT! IT"S CLICKING!!" Ned cried joyfully. 
And it was. 
Ned was scratching the pattern down in agonizing slowness, bothered that he wasn't able to speed up and thus make the ghost speed up. 
And through several minutes, Ned continued as the ghost seemed to pour out an extensive amount of information. 
Ned finally finished, and sat up straight to read it. 
"The ghost says... 
Don't trust the little prick, that's my son and he wants my money. 
His name isn't dennis its James. 
Hello James. 
You don't get the money. 
You will ruin the world with it. 
Damn James, your dad is a dick!" Ned finished. 
James had shrank and shrank, becoming golumesque in his contortedness, scooting uncomfortably backwards away from the noise, and into the shadow of a cypress tree where he began groaning these horrible guttural sounds. 
Leroy looked on aghast, Ned simply curious. 
How oddly do people behave out here in the Californias. 
Aint no two blocks that are the same. 
Unfuckin beatable. 
Some types just tend to complicate their lives with expectations and false entitlement and erratic ire and unchecked appetites. 
But Ned had long ago washed his hands of those who had given in, and it was rather obvious to see who had given in if one was really looking with their eyes open and their discernment sharpened. 
Of course there were the painful lessons to be had, but after one, possibly two lessons we tend to learn, unless it's simply an appetite to be reminded how random and cruel humanity can be. 
But no, lessons three and four. 
those were the good ones. 
They barely killed any small part of me. 
Of course they caused immense irreversible damage, but they led me to lessons five and six, which I can only describe to you as transcendent of language, and it's not because it cost me brain cells and traumatized my neural network connections to language, but wait. 
I meant to say it didn't do that. 
I'm not afraid of the city! I'm NOT" Ned realized he was yelling. 
He hadn't remembered talking, much less shouting. 
He thought it had all been in his head. 
Everyone was looking at him. 
Leroy had retreated to the shade of the cypress and stood with confused expression next to James who still looked like a tazed wet rat, and the one felon had finally peeled his eyes off the ocean to look over at Ned's unintentional soliloquy with curious, almost innocent fascination. 
Jack the Cop had one hand on his taser, and the other on his helmet, unsure whether to run, already completely disappointed in his attempts to befriend the wild card. 
Of course it ends up being the most calm of all of them. 
Jack looked ready to spring to action, but somewhere in his stance were subtle reflections of his hesitation, and willingness to just ditch the whole scene if anything became too heinous. 
Frankie looked up from his sobbing, and in a flash of a second he saw his chance to avoid any sort of complication, and he got up and took off running into the bushes, up a small hill, through some oak and bay trees and up into a rocky meadow where he bounded along towards the expanse of wilderness between highway one and highway one oh one south of monterey. 
Jack the cop looked after him, and didn't even bother to pull his tazer out. 
One less wierdo to worry about. 
Jack turned back to the rest of the group with his hand still perched on the top of his tazer case, and said "good. 
One less fuckin wierdo. 
 Arite now, everybody? Lets get one thing straight. 
NObody is in trouble. 
Everyone is free to leave. 
That's why I didn't shoot him, because he wasn't being detained. 
Neither are any of you, so please, don't fuck with me. 
No one is in trouble, so there's no reason for you guys to all be looking at me like I'm about to pull out a billy club and knock you out, because I'm not!! I hate violence, just like the next guy. 
And there's not much out here to be violent about. 
The occasional drunk who decides to swing at me, but that's still just a night in the drunk tank. 
We aren't all rough and wild like you folk seem to be. 
Except for you mister James. 
You don't seem rough or wild at all." Mister James nodded at the cop approving of the sentiment. 
Finally someone who wasn't talking shit. 
Probably because uncle alfie was known throughout the police community as a great supporter of our boys in blue and had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to all sorts of police oriented charities. 
Wives of fallen officers, Children of officers day care center, free night classes for ruffian teenagers with police parents, private rehab communities for family members of officers, and all his privately owned prisons and how they seemed populated with the happiest most overfed prison guards with 401Ks and dental and solar and such and so on, and a job at any one of the dozen or so Pewterschmidt and Bierbach Private Prison Factories was known to be top of the line laid back overpaid easy street. 
Jack the Cop knew who this guy was and who his "Uncle Alfie" was. 
He had applied at several of their prisons in hopes of busting out of this dead end perpetual wandering of this deserted godless expanse of shoreline that had begun leaving Jack drained and expired at the end of each day, no longer comforted by the softly undulating surface of the water that stretched out before him for miles, instead being reminded of that infinite desert sandscape in his chest that continued to flash its harsh bitter face to him every night. 
That place inside he simply could never manage to explicate nor extract nor isolate. 
He had felt it in there since he was a boy of 7, but had only come to identify it when he was 17. 
up til than it was a feeling he assumed everyone had. 
You know, like when you can't talk,a nd there aren't any words in your head, only feelings without language, and your hands go numb, and you kinda stop seeing 3D. 
and people had said "woah jack, that sounds like a stroke. 
You having strokes?" And he, being 17, was dragged into the doctor to see if he was hopped up on speed or doped out on qualudes or spun dizzled on boomers and sid, or fizzling fiery fantasies on x and e and dmt, but he had come out clean, and they had scratched their heads perplexed and sent him back to school where he continued to suffer these strange psychotropic trips during class and at recess, never quite realizing that he was having panic attacks until 12 years later, at age 29, when he explained one of his episodes to the cute staff nurse at Big Sur Police Station. 
"You're not supposed to be a cop Jack." she had immediately said. 
"I wont' tell anyone though. 
But really, cops aren't allowed to have panic attacks. 
What if you were trying to discern something crucial and you lost word thoughts? I'm not sure I can let you leave this office as an officer. 
You'll have to say something real convincing. 
" Jack still couldn't remember what he had said, later on he always assumed that he had a panic attack in front of her and she simply had pity on him. 
But she let him continue on as an officer of the law, never reporting nor admitting to her superiors what she knew about Jack's incompetence. 
..................................................
6.Jack the Slacker and Jass the Hacker were scurrying along another alley. 
Jack had come to expect such things when meeting up with Jass. 
He always managed to show up somewhere only moments before it got busted, and he always happened to know the only escape route that wasn't blocked. 
Jack had long ago begun suspecting Jass of being the mole, but he was smart enough to simply let that be the possible case, so that this mole of a Jass wouldn't end up simply turning his federal pit bulls on Jack. 
They'd been friends for a long long time, several years in fact, but Jack buying booze off Jass didn't seem to be enough of a bond to give Jack the comforting assumption of Jass's eternal goodwill and irrevocable love and protectiveness of Jack's well being. 
Jack was unsure. 
Especially since Jass had begun drinking again. 
Jasper had actually become a bartender so that he would always have a flow of human wretches to remind him why he himself could no longer drink. 
This was Jass's wise and wonderful approach to staying sober : aversion therapy. 
Exposing himself to what he truly would not tolerate for himself so that he might remain aware and vigilant of his greatest weakness and flaw. 
But now, on the run with Jack, Jass had let himself slip. 
He had gone back to it slowly, and Jack hadn't even noticed until Jass was starting the morning with beer and ending it with whiskey
It had escalated to the point of Jack no longer having any faith in Jass's trajectory itinerary goal motive or awareness of what the hell was going on around him. 
How had this happened.?? Jack thought back and recalled the bugs in the water and the wires in the ... 
beer nuts? What was ,,, this Jass guy was really starting to rub off on Jack. 
the foggy headedness, the perpetual exhaustion and confusion. 
the free fall. 
When had it all begun? How had Jack let himself get pulled into this chaotic gypsy freak lifestyle? Jack was a slacker! He never did ANYthing that might prompt folks to look towards him, cops or otherwise. 
He did the minimum every time, and always kept his friends at a comfortably distant level so that he would never be approached for asinine assistance in things such as moving or barbecuing or camping. 
Jack had been pretty good about this. 
He had managed to avoid several people in his early twenties who seemed like they might make excellent social companions, but Jack had been quicker than them, and managed to find something that they might be offended by but not judge him for so that in the long run they would end up feeling guilty for not calling Jack, instead of the other way round. 
. 
Jack had some demons. 
But I suppose we all do. 
Jass was becoming a demon as the nights wore on. 
Jack occasionally decided he would abandon this lunatic once he fell asleep, but that would end up ironically being the night that Jass managed to pull it together enough to pull Jack in on some new crazy mission where they steal a thousand pounds of jello from a truck a and throw it in the fountain, or they antique 4 blocks of downtown so it looks like it just snowed because of the thousands of pounds of flour they managed to feed through half a dozen industrial sized fans on the construction site across the street, until it rains and the entire street becomes soaked in a gooey dough mess. 
.
One night, as Jass scaled the 230 foot wall of a fish factory, Jack received a phone call. 
It was his cousin Wilson. 
Wilson was a good sort, born with horns. 
and boy did he like those horns. 
Jack was always entertained by how Wilson treated his horns, almost as if they were magical pets sent from on high to keep him company in this strange ill conceived world. 
"I'm in Big Sur!" Wilson had hollered into the phone. 
"BIG SUR!! I went for a drive and something went wrong. 
Are you free to come pick me up? Or do you have 2 mazda tires?" 
"No Wilson, I don't have 2 Mazda tires. 
I can probably come get you. 
I've been camping out in a fish factory for a couple weeks, but we're in monterey. 
I'll be down there in just a few hours."
Jack got off the phone and looked up the factory wall at Jass. 
Poor crazy bastard. 
He'd figure something out. 
Perhaps losing his perpetual companion will kick start him into more effective action. 
These thoughts Jack had half assedly, never believing Jass had a chance, almost convinced it was going to be this very fish factory that would prove to be Jass's undoing. 
But it was not Jack's problem or job. 
to be Jass's savior or stabilizer. 
perhaps his stark indifference and demonstrative honesty might be the reboot that could bring Jass back. 
But Jack's thought pattern had looped, and he quickly turned and walked angrily towards his car, gaining enough emotional momentum to break through the inevitable orbit of final thoughts concerning perhaps not, perhaps one more chance, perhaps we'll see, perhaps sleep on it. 
Jack was unwilling to ponder what staying attached to the reckless Jass might end up costing him. 
He had his own self to keep track of, to take care of, to navigate through the apocalyptic nonsensical whatnot known as day to day existence.

Charles the Bard stood up on top of the train and screamed up into the storm. 
He screamed many things, about how he would not be broken, about how there was no God but is God, about how there was no future nor past, only this infinite present moment that was created by this electricity and compromised by this train and shuddering perpetual with encasements of life water constantly hurtling through infinitude to crash upon the metal roof of these carriages carrying strangers and supplies from one end of the continent to the other, corn for wood, liquor for eggs, tobacco for oranges, paper for pens, led for bullets, milk for bacon, fish for condoms, cow parts for pig parts, blue chips for gold stars, pink ribbons for black and white movies, red flags for yellow lizards. 
The noise Charles was making was his usual blend of ignominious chaos, and this new level of train sounds compromised by and compromising God’s grand orchestra, the thunder storm, Charles in between cast his cackling orchestrations into the infinitely small space between these levels, and he felt as if his voice was within every shudder shake and shift of the the train body gut farm and the swirling psychotic storm essence that embraced and inflamed all Charles’s senses, he felt as alive as the moment he was born, he felt as free as the moment he was born, he felt as pure and infinite as the moment just before. 
He sang and he cried and his tears mingled with rain drops and chased each other down his face like liquid bobsledders on a very hairy course, cruising along crusty chin funk that poor Charles had been far too out there for far too long to ever understand about cleaning up and trimming down and leaving off and upending the damp ends of his outward appearance, but instead he had found his all holy ritual of sacrificing his entire capacity his entire essence, stepping out up and in to the world of the storm and praying for release, new birth, or baptism, whichever God might consider the intentional act of pursuing lighting contact. 
Charles was convinced it would bring him all the information that humans needed to finally perfect their lives and live in a world without violence or greed, pain anger or confusion. 
He knew of course that there would be forms of all this, but it would be purified and it would never be at the cost of another creatures well being. 
Charles was very sure all this would work out because he had lived in nature long enough to know. 
Nature always wins, and it always does fascinating things, especially behind the scenes, with byproducts that we don’t seem to know about or how to manifest into the proper channel of accessibility to other byproducts to turn all aspects into part of the overall cycle and exchange. 
But Charles didn’t know how to explain this or say it, and dare I say it still remains unexplained and unportrayed to say the least. 
Charles had come up with his utopian vision in big sur, and had never really completely understood it himself, because the utopioan vignettes he seemed most aware of were the ones that most large creatures left undisturbed. 
He had a fondness for the unusable. 
Charles envisioned a world where no one did anything ever, except for wander and sing and forage and start small fires with very few materials. 
His was not the closed off broken built up cordoned quarantined and drawn and quartered city of crumbles and kings. 
His was the neglected pathway, the overgrown meadow, and the shimmering dew of some other morning that the universe would never understand nor see through the eyes that Charles saw. 
And this thunderstorm atop a train going from San Francisco to Sacramento, screaming along through the water sky plains of outer nowhere, Charles felt as though he had busted through into infinity again.

Ned didn't need permission to go after Frankie. 
He had seen the desperate gait and the apathetic plunge, and he knew that man would not survive in the wilderness alone. 
He might be able to crush boulders or lift eight times his own weight, but he lacked the grace and awareness that betrays a nature type. 
He might make it awhile, he had that sort of predatorial desperation about him, paired with his aggressive ferocious gumption, he would obviously put up a good fight against the elements and the wild things and the psychological struggle of it all, but Ned enjoyed survivalism, and felt it his natural born duty to go in there after Frankie and track him like a boar or a deer and upon finding him, make the survivaling as pleasant and simple as it can be, especially in such pleasant temperate climes. 
Frankie had left quite a trail, brambles dragged along , every branch within two feet of a human's sized path was snapped, almost as if he were hulking his way through. 
It was almost painfully obvious which way he had gone. 
After awhile the marks became less aggressive, less regular, and less far reaching. 
He was obviously getting tired, which suited Ned just fine. 
They'd been going up quite a hill for quite some time without the aid of switch backs or trails or anything close to man made luxurious 45 % hill hiking. 
And soon the hill crested. 
Up top was a rocky outcropping with several oaks, but the treeline had disipated and there was a massive view down into a hidden valley just 300 yards across, facing the ocean, like a spoon big enough to build a downtown strip on, had been buried with its bowl exposed and its terminal hidden deep in the ecretionary wedge of the santa lucia mountains. 
As Ned crested the ridge he made a squeaky ghasp sound in his throat. 
The valley was populated. 
Or it had been at one time. 
There was tennis courts and swimming pools and bowling lawns and trails that once led up and around into the hills,but which had been cut rather short by aggressive overgrowth obviously thirty years in the making. 
Ned watched Frankie scamper across the huge lawns which were now massive meadowy things. 
Ned tried to imagine what Frankie might be thinking having stumbled across such a rare abandoned universe. 
But he could never have pictured the thoughts going through Frankie's head. 
Frankie was thinking "Mine! This is all mine. 
This place was obviously made while I was in prison. 
I see the Pewterschmidt Bierbach seal above the doors on all the buildings. 
I see the helipad with the P & B Seal. 
This is where my life went. 
This is the money they got burning down their own factory. 
This is the money they got from my years of hard furniture building. 
Forty fucking years. 
And now I get to retire in the grandest style a factory worker or prison bastard ever was offered. 
........................................... 
9. 
Jack the Slacker’s car didn’t go over 45, and he liked it that way. 
He was still fairly shaken up by the sudden personality shift that Jass had gone through, but this was accompanied by profound relief, like surviving a grizzly bear attack or grinding a flaming rail across a tidal wave of tiger teeth. 
Jack felt all sparkly and fresh. 
The wet highway shimmered his path to cousin Wilson and whatever small mess he’d landed in. 
probably nothing serious. 
Just Rocky the RX7, maybe pooped out another piston. 
Wilson did have a tendency to push the trashy little beater Mazda as if it were a formula one car, when everyone around him knew it was a throwback to a teenage fantasy that had initially represented the complete rockstar life that was always out of reach, and now was simply the only part of that life Wilson was able to maintain even enough to go for quiet little jaunts through the mountains. 
Folks in Sand City Sea Side and Salinas would hoot like it was hot stuff, but once he got to Carmel, the hoots would take on a condescending tone. 
But Wilson never noticed. 
And now, Jack in his blue busted ass Toyota Corolla was getting hollers and honks for his slow going and his effulgent exorbitant exhaust that seemed to loom above and behind him like a trail of smoggy demon troops. 
The one was fun, even when the locals would honk and holler. 
They’d zip past him in the wrong lane any chance they got. 
Every last one of them would glare over, they’d leer over, they’d glance over with pitying anger in their eyes. 
And Jack just laid back happily, almost laughing at them. 
Here they are, the most beautiful stretch of coast most people will ever be exposed to, and these fuckin dinosaurs can’t even catch a whiff of the infinite wonderment and glory going on around them. 
The fuckin flowers bloomin!! The waves crashing!! Cows on the beach!!!  Jack loved big sur, and was relieved to be called on to save his cousin from somewhere he himself wouldn’t mind being stranded in. 
Sweet primordial presence of an ancient landscape waiting for humans to evolve to the point of being able to survive it. 
He took a left on nacimiento ferguson and followed its winding concrete back up and up and switching back and forth til he finally reached the peak and Coast Ridge Road. 
He took a right, and into the real wilds he wandered. 
Still not as deep as Frankie and Ned had wandered, but the road became nothing more than a 15 foot rocky ridge road that reminded Jack of some Youtube videos of Afghanistan's most dangerous roads in the world. 
A perfect non sequitor voyage for his hundred dollar heap of automotive run off. 
He felt invigorated to be the rescue team that ended up stranded. 
Just fit right into the last couple weeks of being on the run with Jass for no reason at all, getting side tracked by these bizarre pranks that Jass seemed more interested in than avoiding the goons chasing him. 
Jack wondered where Jass was right now. 
Had he finally found the safe house he was constantly hinting at? Or were his old friends long since locked up or killed off? 
The road upped and downed and swerved and crowned and he realized this was impossible, because ... 
but suddenly it became paved again, and down a couple more swooping vista turns he found the scene. 
he was almost back in carmel, but Wilson had only given Jack the directions that he had taken, not the quickest directions there, so by the time he arrived the sun had long set. 
Wilson and Papa Charles were perched on the hillside gazing out at the ocean, exchanging notes on whether life was better working Wilson's dead end factory job or having spent 40 years in prison building furniture as Papa Charles had been privileged to endure. 
Jack the Cop was laid back on a large rock about 30 feet away. 
Leroy and James were in the shit wagon, writing down messages from the ghost and demanding answers. 
Jack the Slacker squealed up and swung his door open towards Wilson. 
"Eeeeey, Willy! Hop in!"
"Jacky Boy!! Arite, I need my friend here to be coming along as well. 
It's crucial. 
You'll seee. 
His name is papa charles, and he's leading us to the promised land." Jack the slacker shrugged his shoulders. 
"My weekend is open. 
So is my week. 
I'l free pretty much for the next hundred years or so. 
Hey there Papa Charles." As they loaded up and started to drive away, Jack the cop hopped up and started taking slow unsure steps towards them. 
Was he supposed to detain them? Had he successfully kept the peace? So far the various groups had simply broken up into smaller stranger groups, recombining at random, like some sort of unpredictable chemical catalyst trigger medium emulsifier flash point. 
Jack the cop watched the red lights disappear, and saw only a reducing number of variables. 
he was practically home free. 
Just two more kooks, and it looked like they were about to set off in their own direction. 
The only question left to jack the cop was whether or not to ask for a ride. 
He decided it would undermine his authority and compromise the way he had expertly handled the situation, so he decided to feign competence and let the last two drive off with the last working vehicle, and Jack would... 
simply wait for Dan to return. 
Where the FUCK is Dan?!?! 
The night wore on without a care for Jack the Cop. 
....................................
10. 
James and Leroy pulled out and left Jack the Cop there, mildly entertained at his lack of request for a ride out of there. 
"I wonder if his partner is coming back." wondered Leroy aloud. 
"Partners are just temporary set backs required to achieve some higher level of control. 
 ot emotional obligations that help us sleep at night or confront death gracefully." James replied, unthinkingly blunt with his harsh shred of morality which seemed more akin to psychological survivalism in an emotionally bankrupt society. 
Leroy felt a sudden appreciation for being raised in the sticks. 
"So far you've just been pissing him off James. 
Do you have any better plans than shouting at him that you demand your share of his wealth? I think he's up for negotiation. 
Let's try to negotiate."
":We have to attain the upper hand leroy. 
We can't just roll over and show him our weak underbelly. 
Weee have to put him in his place. 
He's incorporeal! "
"Well, you want to assert the upper hand, and I say you're just hungry, because none of us ate today. 
We were all stuck on the mountain for fucking 16 hours. 
Holy shit. 
Let's find a food place."
"Carmel has something I believe. 
We ought to dip in there and find something. 
"No, we're already in Lucia. 
We might as well catch the sunrise with the
And so they pulled into andre's grotto, and had shrimp and bacon omlettes, while some enterprising young teenagers brapped up on their dirt bikes, noticed the ghost machine, pondered among themselves about what it might be and wheether it was worth it to steal and abscond into the wilderness to study it and see if it was something worth keeping. 
And so abscond it they did, and James and Leroy saww them at the last second and saw them just in time to catch a brief description description of the 4 dirt bikes and the vague direction they made off in. 
"I guess I can track them. 
You up for a ten mile hike? Who knows how far they went.."
"Yeah, let's finish breakfast first." agreed James. 
And they slunk back into the diner, a bit disappointed at their own idiotic luck, a bit apprehensive at the long trail ahead of them. 
and a bit sleep deprived and delerious. 
Leroy knew James would be a huge pain in the ass once the hiking started. 
he was not looking forward to it. 
......................
11. 
There was a loud rapid fire knock at the door to Ancient Harold’s apartment. 
Nobody visited him unless they really knew him well, and Jehovahs Witnesses and Vacuum salesmen don’t knock like that. 
Neither do Cops. 
Cops always do the 3 official raps followed by them announcing themselves. 
This sounded like someone who knew Harold well, and was in a desperate hurry to disappear. 
Ancient Harold was happy to help, even without knowing who it might be. 
He leapt up lightly as a cat and danced across the floor humming La Vie En Rose to himself. 
That damn song has been stuck in my head for 3 fucking days now, he thought to himself. 
I wonder why it keeps coming back. 
And last year, about this time, I do believe. 
I was cooking dinner for Chloe’s birthday, and that damn song popped into my head. 
And probably the year before. 
Ahhh, Chloe. 
It’s been too long. 
I wonder where she is now, and if she even cares that I still bake her a giant donut cake every year. 
. 
.
Harold opened the door without even pausing to peer through the peephole, and leapt back, expecting someone to come barreling through the moment it was unlatched. 
Instead, Jass took one quick silent step inside, and pulled the door closed before Harold could identify who his guest was. 
All Jass said was “Ssshhhhhhh….” Harold looked up at him with fascinated sparkling eyes. 
He recognized this one. 
From LONG past. 
Several lifetimes and stylistic shifts ago. 
The name wasn’t coming, nor was the specific occasion on which they last met, but Harold was sure he trusted the guy. 
A whiff of Jass’s breath was enough for Harold to remember what sort of complications might arise, but Harold was an easy going understanding type who didn’t judge the lushes as long as they didn’t judge him. 
And Jass wasn’t in a judgmental mood, especially not towards the only citizen whom he could trust in this city.
Harold motioned for Jass to follow him, and led him to a back room with a trap door in the floor which they went down into a smaller room with gray walls, a sink, and a boom box. 
Harold closed the trap door behind them, flicked on the boom box and turned on the faucet. 
The music was some sort of loud crunchy metal with the scratchy breathy wailing vocals that didn’t seem to be using words. 
With a satisfied Nod, Harold finally spoke. 
“Alrite. 
We’re unbugged. 
We’ve done tests in this room, and every frequency is completely saturated by this combination of white noise and what the kids today call music.”
“This isn’t quite today Harry. 
This music is from 93 if im not mistaken.” 
”Oh, you’re a child. 
You call this music. 
How fanciful and absurd. 
I do enjoy the stretching that the minds of contemporary youth have been able to endure. 
How old are you anyways?”
“Fifty two.” 
”A mere babe. 
In army fatigue swaddling clothes I might add, but fashion has never been my interest, so I hold no grudges for grunge and the visual cravings that come with it. 
Now what was your name?” Jass was startled. 
Shocked.
“You don’t recognize me? Harry! I’m offended. 
We went on some gut wrenching missions together. 
We rescued the arch duke’s mistress from the guerillas in Beliz! We burned down the fake pope’s drug yacht! We assassinated that young guy who the gypsy woman foretold would cause a holy war that would sink two thirds of Europe into the atlantic!”
“Oh come now boy. 
I recognize you. 
I just don’t remember your name. 
After 385 missions with over 100 partners and contacts and guides and pilots and informants and moles and weasels and newts… Of Course I remember you! You were the one Chloe had the hots for.” Jass’s face suddenly fell and he stared at the water pouring out of the faucet into the sink basin.
“Yes. 
I’m that one. 
The grade A charming idiot child who couldn’t manage to fucking figure out how to offer the sweetest most amazing gorgeous smart agent of autonomy the life she deserved. 
Instead I fell into drinking and brawling and crawled off in the night when I realized my presence would end up compromising us all. 
I fucked it all up. 
Gloriously, righteously, infinitely.” Jass shook his head and put his hands over his eyes. 
”That’s quite fine boy. 
I couldn’t have been more demeaning and harsh. 
I miss her to.” Jass looked up obviously shaken.
”What do you mean you miss her?!?! Where is she?! What Happened?!?! We gotta find her!! We Gotta SAVE Her!!”  Harold put a hand on Jass’s shoulder and softly shook his head, his long gray hair duffling about like swamp magic.
“She is not to be saved. 
Nor will she be saving. 
She gave it up. 
When you crawled away, she walked. 
She was only here because you believed and pushed and proved so many things. 
She was more in love with you than you’ll ever know. 
She understood your bottle addiction. 
She forgave you every time. 
She knew you were trying to forget and sleep and get past the consequences of violently demonstrating the need for every human to be free and given options and self agency. 
She simply had no more to give without you there to love her.” Jass sat heavily on the floor, which was much further than he expected, bruising his tailbone a bit. 
He began crawling around a bit to try and relieve the fresh aching injury he had just sustained.
“I’m a bitch bastard quitter sucker path psycho dog mud fuck. 
What what… how?” Harold observed Jass’s strange circumlocution with mild interest, as if he were a puppy watching a bug struggling to cross a crack in the sidewalk. 
”She’s fine. 
She went to college I think. 
And became a… dental hygienist. 
She tells other people that she loves her new life. 
And than those other people tell me. 
They also tell me she never wants to see me again. 
Now what was your name?” Jass stopped crawling and looked up with a broken expression. 
”Harry! I’m so sorry! She ditched you?!?! I’m sorry. 
My name is Jass.”
“OOOOhhhh right. 
I remember that name. 
And it does match your face. 
I recall it easily. 
How strange that you should return here after all these years. 
Did you leave your coat?” 
”Leave my coat?! Are you senile?”
“Well listen up young prick, you can either be polite and decent, or we can do this differently. 
I still know my forms, and I could knock you through that wall there.”
“I’m sorry Harry. 
I didn’t mean to say that. 
No, I didn’t leave my coat. 
I came back because I’m in trouble, and you might be too.”
“I’m in no trouble Jass. 
I don’t talk about the past, and I’ve managed to forget almost everything except faces. 
And Chloe. 
I remember everything about her. 
Most days I feel as though she’s in the next room researching our next mark, or transcribing a recording of some exchange we eavesdropped. 
But I can’t talk about what I don’t remember. 
Isn’t that wild? Brilliant, I think.” 
”You think it’s brilliant to forget your entire past? Your history of accomplishments? Everything you ever did that mattered?”
“Oh Jass. 
You seem to have done some wonderful things since we last saw each other. 
Otherwise why would you be so aggravated by my silent stillness and slightly Buddhist penchant for eternal presence and detachment?”
“You always did like your alan watts, didn’t you?”
“Alright, I’m getting sick of this metal music and these gray walls. 
Please boy, speak up. 
What do you need? I’d like to get back to my crossword puzzle.”
“Well I’m not SURE what I need. 
I thought I’d show up to a crowd of misfit dissidents, like the old days! Not some tottering old whispy haired crossword puzzler.”
“Well if you’re quite finished, I’ll be getting back to my words.”
“No! Wait! Just tell me where the Stump is. 
He’ll be able to get me to a safe house in the rural zone of midcoast California, where I can reboot and start getting into some blackmail bartering to get these bastards off my neck.”
“You have some bastards on your neck? The Stump comes by once a week. 
We play scrabble every Thursday.”
“Jesus Fuck! You guys really DID retire. 
I don’t believe it. 
How the mighty have gone soft. 
Scrabble every Thursday. 
At least tell me you guys exchange high level top secret information clues with every word you play.”
“If that would make you happy, than please, stick around until his next visit, and see if you can decode… the SECRET Ooobity Goo CODE that we exchange through the scrabble board. 
You’re so cute with your spy games.” Jass smiled, finally recognizing the old bastard. 
Harry always was a bit of his own breed. 
He had changed his vernacular and tone and stance and even his body type. 
Jass could only assume that he was deeeeep under cover. 
Harry would never quit this business. 
It was in his blood. 
Why else would Chloe ditch him to become a Dental Hygenist?
“You sleep down here Jass. 
I’ll drop you sack lunches and maybe a few books to keep you busy. 
Otherwise, get comfortable. 
You’re in a safe room, not a safe house, so don’t try leaving. 
Also, there’s a couch on top of the trap door. 
I’ll, drop you some blankets and a bucket to shit in. 
Any questions?”
“What day is it?!”
“Friday.”
....................................
12. 
The voyage on the train ended up being far less eventful than Charles the Bard had expected. 
He recalled the immense release of his being astride the land leviathan, he even remembered seeing the river coming up and feeling unchangeably compelled to make the leap, timing it so that he didn't crush himself against the walls of the canyon, being oh so cautious to launch out far enough to not bounce against the sides of the train or the tressel that held it aloft the massive gorge of a river. 
He hadn't made it to Sacramento, but the name meant nothing to him beyond the vague memory of what a sacrament was. 
something holy. 
something worth working towards. 
he had seen the river beneath him during the storm and felt it his official sacrificial sacramental duty to launch and fall and flail freely. 
sweeet sweeet free fall. 
no one else would ever understand it. 
He had already gotten used to the flaccid passive floppy baggy forms that domesticated humans seemed to exhibit. 
They were not surviving, but being softened by society. 
he was unsure if he really did come from the same species as these creatures. 
He was not offended or bothered by them, he simply didn't feel the connection that he expected. 
He'd seen the ants swarming over each other, almost becoming one cohesive creature, one singular being He did not feel similar flock or tribe or fleet sentiment concerning these busy strange bumping awkward humanoid habit formed installations of Universe At large. 
The small town felt more aligned with something he could understand. 
They moved along slowly like deer in the forest. 
They exchanged greetings and awarenesses with the concern a chipmunk gives a grass hopper or a moth gives a frog. 
They were aware of each other, but were not reliant on the other to acknowledge or offer or sacrifice anything at their behest. 
Charles the Bard almost felt human among these rural types. 
it left him befuddled as to how to integrate himself with them. 
He simply kept passing from town to town, walking mostly, 20 or 30 or 40 miles a day, pausing to camp wherever he was whenever he felt like it. 
In this way he made his way from Grass Valley through a dozen tiny towns such as angels camp and mariposa further and further directionless, always south, simply because it felt more inviting. 
Little did he know he was following clues back to his Etruscan plate, the mess canyon of Big Sur. 
He had been wandering through his curious pattern for a week now, and was looking west from san juan batista, wondering why he had ended up in this strange intermediary zone . 
walking the edges of the farm fields gave him substantial grazing and he barely ever had to stop his slow plodding pace, never heavy, always light and airy, everything bright and easy. 
His clothes were beginning to show the voyage, and his beard had returned. 
he mission held ghosts, and Charles the Bard could feel them pulling his face and pointing his steps. 
he didn't know what the ghosts wanted, but he knew they were there with their intentions and their needs and their pasts and their hungers. 
Charles resented them for imposing such a strong hand in the will of the living. 
They had no right! Their turn had ended!  Like a little league father shouting at his son who can't play short stop for shit. 
it's not your turn any more old timer. 
If the boy feels like catching a bug instead of a fly ball, it's him expressing his unique distaste for baseball. 
Sorry, america's past time is not everyone in america's past time. 
inf act, many consider it merely a quaint throwback to a time when factory workers had nothing better to do with their extra energy except to whack balls and run in circles, and shout "I'm HOME!!" 
Charles the Bard would not be pointed any longer. 
These ghosts had to stop it was not his to follow their post script after thought notes. 
If they had any understanding of life, anything near what Charles had learned in Big Sur, they would be far more willing to let the world do as it may. 
Charles the Bard knew that his afterlife would be a perpetual sunset, and that these poor stupid ghosts were too stupid to come up with something so sublime and poetically heavenly, always watching each new time zone slowly end its day, 24 sunsets per day, 24,000 sunset moments, 24,000,000 sunset moments, infinitely fading perpetually revealing and obscuring, and when that gets boring, we'll have ten centuries of perpetual sunrise. 
Forever watching everything become finally illuminated. 
And like the night, this narrative has slid across the awareness of the reader, obscuring all thoughts of outer reality, fully consumed by some strange dream concocted by a thirty year old bachelor in Lompico California, temporarily suspended, we two sit. 
i the author, and you the reader. 
and this connection has enabled the transmission of this fictitious narrative, our combined attentions enough to lift these clay made golems from the lake of over mind and camp them upon the shores of suspended disbelief, and we watch the perpetual sunrise as the characters march up and down the stage and we quickly switch to perpetual sunset as they strut and fret their hour upon the stage. 
All at once the feeling Left Charles. 
The ghosts had stopped. 
They had unclenched his mind, and they had given in to his will. 
They were no longer steering or pushing or whispering half thoughts that he couldn't identify or sense the origin of. 
He turned north and made quick steps to the end of town, dropping into a slow relaxed lolloping meander on towards yosemite, that place people kept mentioning when they saw him. 
"You look like you been living in the yosemite wilderness. 
Well welcome home Mister Muir. 
We've been waiting a mighty long time for you. 
" Charles the Bard didn't get the reference, but he didn't have to. 
......................................................................................
13.The abandoned resort was more than Frankie had ever imagined. 
There were eccentrically fancy master suites in all 5 of the cabins, and he declared two of them as his own. 
One he turned into his private weight room, a hobby which he had taken up in prison and felt gave him a daily ritual that stabilized his mind set in this new chaotic logic of wilderness survivaling. 
Even though it was made quite easy with the epic amount of canned foods they had found in the pantry large enough to feed ten thousand men for ten thousand days. 
.. 
This place had obviously been arranged to be survivalable through most world crises, no matter who came out victorious. 
and by who I mean which nuclear weapon wielding world power. 
Ned had made himself busy establishing a night watch on the roof of the pool house where he could shine solar powered spot lights on anything that moved on the grounds, so long as it was south of the pool house. 
he had plans for wiring in some new flood lights so that he could illuminate the north and east and west of the yard, but for now all he could find was one working light fixture with functional bulb and power supply wiring. 
The survival elements were all established, and Ned didn't much worry about specifics, more fascinated by the more and more surprise elements that Frankie continued to uncover. 
He unearthed a giant sort of Cellar Door thing which turned out leading to the casino room, where they had room for well over a hundred party goers. 
There weren't any cash registers, but Frankie had found five different safes hidden behind the picture in the lobby,/ club house, under the throw rug behind the bar in the casino room, above the refrigerator behind a seeming air duct, panel, literally in a rock wall a short stroll up the canyon mouth, and one very very tiny safe, just big enough for a key or a pack of smokes, or one stack of ten million dollar bills. 
Frankie wondered if those were real. 
Ned had solved his boredom crisis by inventing a simple ghost morse device on day 3. 
He realized that he had accidentally memorized morse code, and simply had to ask the ghost to start I mean, he had not memorized morse code, but he just had to have the ghost start with the 26 letters, and Ned could transcribe that as his key. 
So While Frankie leapt about and searched out his and explored his newly claimed land of milk and honey, Ned  Continually unearthing new realms, such as the bomb shelter and the underground tunnel which led to nowhere except further into the mountain, and the false book case with the laboratory behind it for cooking exotic fancy drugs.
Meanwhile, Ned had finished his new Ghost Morse code machine, and spent all his time copying down new messages that were constantly streaming in from the other side. 
He started to wonder if maybe he could charge the living relatives for the service of satisfying the demands of the deceased. 
There were hundreds of spirits on the other end of the line demanding begging pursuing seeking and asking for his corporeal help. 
Occasionally Pewterschmidt would manage to eek in a word edgewise and say something along the lines of "You little prick!, or "This is my land!" the latter of which Ned had taken to be a deceased american Indian spirit. 
....................
Finally Thursday had come. 
Jass knew this because he was given one plastic spoon a day, and there lay 6 plastic spoons. 
This had been his only clue as to the passage of time. 
It had been a think rope to which he clung, but it got him through. 
Also, singing every classic rock song he knew at the top of his lungs, of course with the metal and the water running, had given him given him some sort of exercise and release to exhaust him into some semblance of sleep each... 
twelve hour cycle when he was served a meal that consisted of vaguely dinnery items. 
But today he knew it was thursday because it started with spoon number 7. 
8 hours later it was followed by a scrabble board, a very short stiff looking man, practically a legal midget, but just barely not, obviously built well enough to dead lift an elephant. 
And behind him was the wispy old kook Ancient Harold. 
It was scrabble night. 
Jass thought he was ready. 
He would study diligently the words that these two played, and he would deduce what was really going on. 
After all, life is 99% behind the scenes. 
They set up the board without talking. 
Jass felt a bid awkward, since they were allowed to talk in the safe room, but the stump seemed completely disinclined. 
before they were all set up, the stump quickly spelled out a message for Jass. 
Harry simply looked at his feet. 
the message read
'they implanted me with a bug. 
If I dig it out they'll know we know. 
If I speak out loud anything other than scrabble nonsense, they'll know. 
If I even hesitate to speak they'll know. 
It also reads my heart and lungs and blinking and ... 
I found it when i went in for an x-ray to examine my broken foot. 
I mean, the lump in my lung. 
or was it my cranial fracture? Whatever it was, there it was. 
A fucking sub-dermal bug. 
Jass had simply watched his quick fingers reworking the letters into more words after words after words, the living scrabble board. 
he'd never seen anything like it, but the stump was obviously used to it. 
Jass suddenly realized he was going to lose very badly at Scrabble. 
The game began, and the Stump continually only ever played words that would be offensive to anyone over 60. 
Geezer and senile and soft and broken and weak and tired and concede. 
These were obviously stump's way of fuming at Harry's passive present, and irreverence for the past. 
The stump was not happy with it. 
Jass looked on in fascination as Ancient Harold played his own responses which seemed rather d jointed at first, but soon took on their own linguistic lilt. 
Butterflies and sense and life and joy and sunshine and breeze and blossom. 
It was a battle of trigger words. 
They were definitely having a conversation, but to Jass's disappointment it wasn't about which senator they were going to sabotage or what corporation was due for a check of power and a balance of financial weight. 
Jass was dizzy and fuzzy and the long lost human interaction was enough to make him feel transcendent. 
And at long last, hours later, the scrabble game was over. 
jass hadn't even played, just watched his ancient old time co workers, brothers in arms, fellow autonomists, playing a word game with little painted tiles. 
Something felt very strange and surreal about it, as if it were all they had ever been doing. 
But he didn't let it get to him. 
He simply became determined to follow the Stump wherever he might be off to. 
At least they agreed on Ancient Harold's lazy indifference. 
When the Stump finally got up to go, Jass leapt up like a cat. 
He scampered over to the trap door and waited like a dog going to the park. 
the stump looked at him and shook his head slowly and deliberately. 
Jass flipped him off silently and determinedly. 
Harry looked on as if nothing were happening. 
finally the stump crawled up the latter and went straight for the door. 
Jass was steps behind him. 
The stump acted like he wasn't there. 
. 
at the refrigerator, Stump paused and scratched a message. 
"Jass. 
You have my permission to follow me to one place. 
But if you follow me to a second location, you will be buried at that second location. 
Do not doubt me. 
I am not the free spirited idealist I once was. 
"
and without looking Stump went out the door. 
Jass barely had time to read the note and follow him. 
Harry watched them go without a flicker of emotion or a sound from his mouth.
Stump led Jass up and down alleys past the back doors of half a dozen restaurants, only twice getting chased by random dogs. 
Much the way Jass had led Jack when Jack accidentally agreed to a mission he had no intention of even believing win to start with. 
Finally they arrived at an abandoned nursery. 
It looked like a greenhouse, and sticker bushes had crawled up the walls and started covering the roof. 
it looked impenetrable from where they were standing, but the Stump simply ducked down and poked at something, and the stone floor slid 18 inches to one side, and they had enough room to duck into a partially sunken pathway that led into the belly of the sticker bushes that were encased in the abandoned greenhouse, which ended up completely screening the autonomy zone hidden within. 
An autonomy zone is what they had once established, dozens in each city. 
A place for the dissidents to communify and create plans and projects to keep the powers that be in check. 
The lawlessness of the whole thing was cornerstone to the credo of interrupting the powers that be in their continued subjugation of the ever growing slave class.zone. 
They breached the room, and Jass instantly fell to his knees. 
He couldn't help but sob. 
Stump didn't even pause, he swept past the short brunette reading a transcription of some recent eavesdropping mission, and the Stump was gone forever, quickly being hidden by the mass of foliage he had entered, to emerge somewhere far away, I'm sure, and far more safe, and less autonomous than where he had left Jass, gazing befuddled at his lost love, sweet sweet Chloe. 
The girl who had made him want to be something and change the world to make it worth saving, the girl who had held his heart in her hands and only ever cherished it, never confronting him about his need to calm down in extreme way,s never belittling him for his loss of emotional control when far too many deep, the girl who had left the cause according to her father Ancient Harold, because she so loved Jass. 
The girl who now no longer talked to her father , and in jass's mind it seemed that it was quite the opposite of Harry's interpretation, and rather she no longer spoke to him because he lived in a false reality where there were no more autonomous zones, and Chloe was a Dental hygienist. 
 They gazed at each other for quite a few minutes stupidly, dumbly, idiotically, reduced to that comfort zone where you could easily die due to neglecting your survival instinct, but there's some sort of benevolent spirit that seems to protect the love gazers from any tragedy that might occur around them, but please dear reader, do not test this theory. 
I don't want your blood on my hands. 
Chloe instantly leapt up. 
(after 3 minutes of stupefied gazing) and said "come on. 
I'm taking you home. 
"
Jass had assumed she meant back to her apartment, but when they got in her car she pulled out onto the freeway headed south and west, and after a couple hours Jass realized she had some other thing in mind. 
"are we running away babe?" he asked, his face stained with tears, his brain absolute mush from his week in solitary, .
"No, we're going home. 
I found this place, and it's ours. 
don't worry about it. 
just .... 
talk to me. 
tell me where you've been ask me what I've been up to. 
This silence has been the perfect appetizer for being exposed to your presence again, it's been a century. 
I feel like you're a hot tub and I'm terrified of falling in and getting burned. 
But talk to me. 
I want to hear your voice. 
Only the stump is wired. 
We all got xrays after he spelled it out for us, and we all seem to be clean. 
"
They drove for five hours and talked the whole time about exploits and autonomy zones and goals and bastards and punishments and everything they had seen in between. 
.
...................................................
32. 
Papa Charles was obviously very new to being outside, much less navigating rural highways and byways through cascading canyon ranges and the part of Big Sur known locally as the Muck. 
He had them doing U-turns every twenty minutes, occasionally finding the same road name on a different part off the map and rebooting the whole search. 
"It says its off coast ridge, but I'm not sure if its the one in carmel or lucia."
"Those are fifty miles apart! How can you not know?"
"Well for starters, I've never been outside the fucking prison walls since I was deposited there 4 decades ago. 
This has me a bit rusty on local geography. 
Second of all, the guy said it was south of monterey, not three hundred paces south by south east from the lone cypress tree. 
Come on now. 
We have some clues. 
Let's follow them!"
"arite, what are the friggin clues?"
"He said he could hike to jade cove in a day. 
that means maybe twenty miles. 
yeah? how far can you hike in a day? 
"Out here? less than ten. 
Let's start at Jade cove. 
Did he describe walking up on Jade Cove, like what direction he was coming from?"
"He said he was coming downhill from the mountain."
"Well that's just fucking brilliant. 
We have it triangulated to South of Monterey and East of Jade Cove. 
This will be easy." Jack said, incapable of hiding his frustration. 
"Lets just go back up and look for the beech tree with the bicycle in it."
"I agree." chimed in wilson. 
"That's our only real clue. 
Everything else is just vague directional mappery. 
Not literally applicable to the current space which we occupy. 
Take this right. 
It looks promising." 
"It's dirt! I'm not sure the corolla can take it." 
"Corollas can take anything you dish out." assured wilson. 
"Don't you dare baby this piece of shit." And off they went in search of a beach cruiser perched in a beech tree. 
After a half an hour on the rattle afghaniesque road known as coast ridge, they pulled around a fish hook blind corner and there it was, just barely visible through the foliage, about ten feet higher than where the poor dead prison bastard had predicted it. 
You see, the tree had grown since. 
But the boys had been expecting such a complication, and all broke out into a cheer when it was sighted. 
"I can't fuckin believe it!" squealed wilson, his voice cracking like a teenager. 
"It's real!! I half expected this whole thing to be a ruse so that you could murder us and steal the car!" Papa Charles snorted in disbelief. 
"I was arrested for protesting the unfair treatment of workers, and suddenly you think I'm a mass murdering psycho?" 
"40 years is a little more than suddenly. 
God only knows how prison changed you." Wilson replied. 
Papa Charles shook his head quietly. 
Jack unspeakingly pulled his car off into an alcove of overgrown whatnot. 
The car disappeared nicely, and they all exited the vehicle. 
"What now?" queried Jack, locking up the car.
"We hike downhill towards the ocean. 
It should bring us around a big sweeping rocky ridge thing, and than we'll see it spread out before us like... 
Like... 
the buffet at the belagio, I think it was."
"So it's treasure that's just laying out like food on a table?"
"Well, it's not technically treasure. 
it's bigger than treasure. 
You'll like it." 
"Aww, don't get all cryptic on us now Chuck! You can't expect us to follow you into the chaotic nonsense of this wilderness without really knowing what we're at least going for, much less getting into."
"Fine! It's property. 
It's got buildings and canned food. 
I want to live there. 
You guys are welcome to stay as long as you want and visit whenever you get the hankering, but I have the deed, and I inherited it, and you can't take that from me." They all fell silent and hiked and hiked and hiked until the sun was reclined on the watery horizon, and all three of them started to get extremely uncomfortable. 
It was too dark to traverse the heinous path they had taken back to the car. 
It was still unclear whether or not they were getting anywhere. 
A bike in a tree is not exactly a guarantee. 
At last they rounded ridge number 22, and there it was below them, laid out like the belagio. 
But what they didn't expect was the one human so far down there dancing around on the lawn, and the other perched on the roof next to the pool. 
It looked like he had binoculars, and the trail they were on showed signs of recent use, but only from the property, and not from the road. 
It seemed they had found the furthest out-perch that Ned had found for himself, but the treasure hunters were unaware that it was Frankie and Ned. 
They thought perhaps it was cannibals or maniacs. 
or BOTH?!?!
.. 
..
"Holy Fuckin Shit." Ned let the binoculars flop against his chest. 
 "Frankie!! We got VISITORS!!" Ned called down to Frankie who immediately stopped his cartwheeling and looked up intriguingly. 
"It's just more deer right? More venison?!' 
"OH No! it's humans." Frankie's face fell. 
"But good news, it's friends!" Frankie looked oh so perplexed. 
absolutely baffled. 
"It's Papa Charles! And Wilson! And they have someone else. 
Probably a ride they called in."
"now how in the fuck did they find us?!"
"I think they found the property and weren't expecting us. 
Quick, grab the bull horn. 
They look scared and confused that this place is occupied."  Frank ran into the boat house and found the bullhorn which they had been using to spook birds for hunting. 
He hollered up to them assuring words, starting with their names. 
"WILSON! PAPA CHARLES!! WELCOME!! YOU"VE FOUND THE LAST RESORT!!! OR IS IT LOST RESORT? ME AND NED NEVER QUITE SETTLED ON WHICH NAME IT SHOULD HAVE. 
"That's Frankie!" Hollered Papa Charles, and broke into a run. 
It was a ramshackle run through overgrown downhill shrubbery chaos, and he fell many times, finally slowing down when he sustained a good bleeder to his forehead. 
The other two made their way cautiously and slowly and passively fascinated, as if watching someone else's story unfold.
.............................................
33. 
Charles the Bard was perched on the edge of the desert when the teenagers braaped up. 
There were 3 of them. 
One had the ghost machine attached to the back of his dirt bike. 
Another had saddlebags full of foody type supplies, and the third had an extra helmet. 
 Only one took his helmet off, the one with the ghost machine. 
"Our ghost says we need to find you. 
Are you Charles?" Charles nodded, mildly annoyed that the ghosts continued to find ways to annoy him. 
What could this ghost possibly want?  "He says you're a billionaire if you will only come with us and meet your dying father." The word billionaire meant very little to Charles the Bard, but the word Father struck a chord that both hurt and shimmered. 
What might it be? He had never met his father, and his mother had always been vague, saying he was very busy taking part with world affairs. 
Charles supposed that to become a billionaire one must be tapped in to some rather global concerns, without even speaking, he stood and walked over to the bike with the extra helmet and silently placed the helmet on his head and hopped on behind the lead teenager who still remained nameless, and off they tore away from the Salton Sea, back north towards the hospital in monterey where they were keeping old beirbach. 
 
.....................................................
34. 
James had been struggling to keep up with Leroy with no success. 
Leroy simply had to stop and wait for fifteen minutes for every five that he hiked. 
The teenagers had left an obvious dirt bike trail, 3 tire tracks tracing their way up the hills into the mess of Big Sur. 
They had been tracking for hours now, and had made less than 4 miles. 
Leroy knew it was hopeless, and had begun entertaining the notion of simply dragging James in circles just for fun. 
But as the sun crested and began falling, Leroy decided it would be hell to be in the wilderness at night with this manchild who couldn't even dress himself much less forage or survive.
James crested the latest pausing spot and saw Leroy smoking a rollie cigarette, watching the ocean. 
James couldn't breath and his angora sweater was absolutely filthy torn and unsalvageable. 
His leather shoes were blatted and bursqued, and his face was nicely garoomphalaied. 
It made Leroy very happy to see a leech of a billionaire in such dire straits. 
Leroy didn't hate James. 
he considered it simply a matter of luck that the poor bastard was born into the station he now occupied. 
Leroy simply considered it as entertaining as the shirt someone wears. 
This is all that Leroy considered when evaluating someone's social station. 
Simply the fashion sense they were raised on and the outfits they inherited and the expectations for holiday family gatherings. 
Nothing more. 
And a little bit of pity eeked out, but not much, because Leroy had been in much more miserable situations than what James was going through. 
"I'm done!" panted James' "I don't want the money anymore. 
I just want to be in my room watching my tv eating my ice cream!" Leroy perked up. 
"What kind of ice cream do you have?"
"We have every type that Ben and Jerry's has to offer. 
I order the one of each collection about once a month. 
All the extra ones I give to the house keeping and butlers and cooks and chauffeurs to give to their kids or whatever. 
It's charity." 
"Well why don't you charitize me mon frer! Let's go to the ice cream!!" James rolled this over in his mind for a minute. 
"It'll be easier down hill, and I'm sure Charles the Bard will show up again, we just have to be there to compromise his inheritance. 
Or get the ghost thing, we'll get our chance. 
But right now we have a chance for ice cream, and I really think it's that time." James nodded, and they began the downhill hike back to the car.
"We can also order pizza and paper view." added James.
PART THREE :: THE SLIPSHOD SLAPDASH
.......................................................
35. 
life at the Last Resort had settled into some sort of lost boys swiss family robinson x files domestic relative estimation of bliss like circumstances. 
Each individual appreciated it separate to their own level of interest. 
Wilson was calling Matilida more and more frequently, begging her to move down there and join them. 
Frankie was having the time of his life hunting squirrels and blue jays and playing hand ball with Papa Charles. 
Papa Charles had started writing a book on a typewriter he had found in the basement of suite B7. 
It was supposedly his analysis of how much more freedom can be experience when true prison hood has also been experienced. 
And the combined truth of these precepts being most demonstrated in homestead survivalism. 
It had a tongue in cheek tone throughout, because he acknowledged that he was in minimum security prison, and was now playing at survival in an abandoned resort with feather pillows and infinite canned food and solar satellite phones and an escalator that might still work if Jack ever figures
Jack had really gotten a kick out of the place, and he and Wilson had first cleaned up the lounge, dusting off the pool table, fixed up the horse shoe pits, and the one where old people slide hockey pucks down a giant skee ball in 2D sort of hop scotch rink. 
You know, dry curling. 
Ned was the only one who was not faring well. 
He'd been there since the start, day one, 7 days with Frankie, and he had built his ghost morse 2.0 on the third day. 
so for four days now, he'd been holed up in the private cafeteria room where the help eats, and he had been filling notebook after notebook with requests. 
Jack initially would stop by and peruse the selections of requests for post mortem modification of this substantial realm known as physicality. 
This pile over here, by the dumpster? That's murder requests. 
Jack kicked at it, and it slumped horribly, spilling paper guts across the concrete. 
Jack had flipped to page one and it was rather entertaining, while mildly extremely totally disturbing. 
"I need you to protect the sanctity of my family name and do the right thing and off my brother Stefan" at which point Ned had stopped transcribing, realizing it was a request he was unwilling to follow through on. 
He simply couldn't trust a ghoul, and murder at their own impunity. 
For all he knew al pacino or capone or whatever would have him kill off j edgar hoover who would have him kill off martin luther king junior who would have him kill off henry ford who would have you kill off marx who would have you kill off ray bradbury who wrote a story that gave him nightmares. 
Ned simply wasn't going to break any laws in order to satisfy the needs of some dead stranger, and he made this very clear to the ghosts. 
One day, as Jack poked his head in, he caught Ned running through the rules again to an apparently empty room, but apparently was full of ghosts. 
"Aright my ghostie friends. 
Let's run through the rules again. 
1. 
No murder. 
why do some many dead people want more death? I am unwilling to act as the hand of life and death fate. 
rule number two, I can't leave here, so it has to be something small, preferably something i can send on a telephone, because I have one of those. 
" he pointed at the satellite cell phone that ran off solar panels, sitting at the edge of his paper piled desk. 
"Be precise, be quick. 
There's a lot of ghosts waiting for me to listen to them, so remember, chronologically in reverse, so I'm dealing with things from this century. 
Tell me your name, your request, and how you expect me to carry out your needs." He looked up at Jack with a wild look in his eye. 
"They don't stop Jack. 
The dead do not shut up. 
They never will. 
I've become the slave of the pen. 
My lips are moving now, but I'm not talking. 
I am merely a channel for the other side to shit its last minute requests for a fucking prank . 
You know, I was told to call someone in russia and tell them "halzoom gabaroom?" The ghost said it meant "I love you and miss you dolores. 
keep an eye on the red orchid, which he said was a symbol of their marriage. 
turns out I accidentally called in a bomb threat to a preschool. 
of course that ghost never came slinking back. 
His final request was a prank!! What kind of maniacs am I dealing with jack?!?!" 
The next day Jack had walked in as Ned was relaying a message. 
"I'm sorry sharon, but your husband Chad wants you to know that he's dead. 
he was in active duty and his auto carriage was ambushed. 
No Saron, I'm serious. 
NO This is NOT a prank! What kind of creep do you think I am? I'm in touch with the dead. 
No, I'm not anti war and I'm not asking you for money. 
Sharon! STOP SHARON!! It's REAL!!!" Ned looked up at jack wild eyed and frazzle haired. 
"This job is not getting easier Jack. 
Either it ends up being a prank, or the person on the other end of the line thinks it is. 
Poor fucking sharon. 
I just ruined her day. 
And it'll be worse when she finds out it was real. 
You're a DICK Chad!! I don't care if you were defending our country when you died. 
Why couldn't you wait for that information to go through the proper channels?!! NOW your wife is gonna get... 
I'm sorry Jack. 
I'm yelling at Private Chad S Hermans, a deceased war vet who was just in iraq this morning. 
and now, is a fucking corpse. 
A corpse with last minute wishes that can be satisfied by the one and only sucker who left his foot in the door!! The piss ant elevator operator on the vertical ladder of stix.
Ned was tired. 
The dead were not. 
They did not keep human hours, and he was locked into his unique role almost irrevocably. 
Jack was worried about him when on the third day he returned to find the door locked. 
inside, he could hear Ned on the phone. 
"Yes Mrs Mulligan, I know how your husband died. 
It was murder. 
No Mrs Mulligan, I'm not joking. 
I'm not a prankster. 
I'm simply a medium transmitting messages. 
I'm only the messenger. 
Your husband told me some specifics that only he would know. 
the mole on your left inner thigh. 
No Mrs Mulligan, I'm not a peeping tom! Who? No, I'm not judge Peterson's boy. 
That's ridiculous. 
I'm a concerned citizen. 
I was only trying to help you! No, I don't know if it would make any difference. 
You're right mrs mulligan, I don't know why I listened to your asshole husband to call you and relay a message which has no bearing on your present life. 
He obviously does NOT want you to be happy Mrs Mulligan. 
I guess that's the real message from this situation. 
I'm sorry Mrs Mulligan. 
i hope you find someone who isn't a douche bag and remarry. 
Jack pressed his ear to the door and heard all this and quickly decided to let Ned brave the waters alone, and Jack would be there afterwards if Ned needed someone to talk to, which he no doubt would. 
The next day Ned emerged of his own accord. 
In his white knuckled hands he gripped the ghost morse machine. 
His eyes were bright red from not blinking or closing at all for far too long. 
His jaw was tight tight clamped and the veins stood out on his neck and forehead. 
He was emaciated and wobbley, and he reeked like his insides had begun dying without permission nor agreement from his outsides. 
His ghost machine was ticka tacking rapidly and wildly. 
The spirits knew what was coming. 
They were sending through their post mortem death rattle. 
But Ned would not be swayed. 
He approached the end of the property which was a 5000 foot cliff face leading down to the rocky shores of the sea
He looked down the cliff face and Ned's eye twitched and he glanced down at the bleeping machine, and let a wild cackle escape. 
. 
His giggle quickly rose to a wailing screeching laughter until finally he flung the thing from his hands out into open space, at which point he fell instantly silent. 
 The machine hurtled down down down, shrinking to a dot before making a tiny splash a mile below em. 
Ned slumped forward and almost followed
38,000
his broken machine, but Jack ran up and grabbed him, pulling him into a heap backwards, away from the cliff, near the lounge chairs on the grassy greenery. 
"Well done Ned. 
I wanted to suggest that to you three days ago, but you seemed.. 
determined to do your part for humanity."
"They aren't humanity anymore. 
They're post postcript. 
. 
margin scribbles... 
they're nothing more than the readers of the past. 
or... 
livers of the past, readers of the present. 
onlookers. 
 othing more than peeping toms and fucking voyeurs. 
I shall never again take anything a ghost says seriously."
"It's good to hear you say that Ned. 
You wanna go squirrel hunting with me and Frankie? Today he's using the air rifle and I have bola bolas. 
You could use either the home made wrist rocket or the home made bow and arrow."
"I need.. 
water. 
is the pool open yet?" 
"You've only been in there for three days Ned. 
We don't work quite that fast. 
Besides. 
how the hell are we supposed to get everything back to life? There are only so many solar panels. 
It's not quite hundred percent self sustaining. 
"
"It will be when we're done with it." whispered Ned, and gave a malnourished sleep deprived grin. 
...............................................
36. 
Charles the Bard flitted and meeped between aisles through the parking lot, like a meercat on the serringhetti, completely baffled by the sheer quantity of cars. 
He was nervously humming and occasion ally whistling while the teenager tugged him along enthusiastically. 
"Come on Chuck. 
we made it! The ghost says your dad is in here, and he's dying! You gotta go to him jack.." The teenagers were being really heartfelt, and had really put alot of effort into trying to make this happen, and it wasn't just because Pewterschmidt's ghost had told them where to find a stash of loot. 
The teenagers had already decided to continue extorting various deadnesses with the machine, always in exchange for directions to treasure. 
it didn't have to be the ghost's treasure, the ghost just had to find it and tell the teens where it was. 
They already had a dozen cases lined up. 
After they finished the Pewterschmidt contract, wherein the ghost requests that his dead partner be reunited with his dead son so that the inheritance wont fall into the hands of the son of the ghost who would literally destroy the world with it......... 
ampersand, ampersand, ampersand. 
Need I say more?
But we're not up to task to get into debates with the fictitious union of characters defense, which is acronymed F.U.C.D. 
for a reason, because in a world where I am God, everyone else is F.U.C.D. 
I ought to make an infomercial. 
"Do you object to the universe into which you have been thrust, the creation of some faceless overbeing? Are you conflicted with the realms and personalities you're forced to deal with in this life of yours which has been completely concocted by a stranger who's omnipresent and omni-in control? Well you need to turn to the Fictitious Union of Character's's Defense, or F.U.C.D. 
If you're dealing with someone else's fictions, you need to get F.U.C.D. 
It's that simple. 
. 
And since none of us is our own author, we all end up F.U.C.D. 
in the end. 
Even the author of this piece of copy. 
First, I the reader have needed to get F.U.C.D. 
in order to protect my personal interests from the ruthless hands of this irreverent author. 
And than, he had to get F.U.C.D. 
in response to the authors of his own realities, which like here, ends up being a lot of screaming, usually "Kill The Narrator" or "Damn Thee Posieden!" or some such hulabaloo. 
Charles the Bard came too. 
they had been leading him along the hallways of the hospital, past pastel nurses and up staircases and down more corridors past janitors and interns, til they got to c16, the room of Alfonso Bierbach, billionaire, humanitarian, eccentric, genius, bipolar philosopher, and father of Charles the Bard. 
Charles the Bard looked blankly upon the old man, struggling to breathe struggling to eek out words. 
 wondered if he was supposed to bring any proof. 
He realized he didn't care. 
He was just doing this so the teenagers would continue to behave. 
So he approached the old man, and did what he figured most family members do for greeting. 
He patted the old man on the belly, and went "pppphhhttt. 
pppphhhtttt." He wasn't sure why he had chosen to do this, something deep in his memory told him that old people like to be treated like babies. 
He wasn't sure if this was real or a jungle memory, but he decided to go with it. 
The old man seemed to buy it, and relaxed a bit, as if he had been expecting a hit squad. 
Nope, just a n eccentric and his rather juvenile entourage. 
 Charlie's greeting seemed to reignite the old man's fury and gusto. 
He sat up all (yup) of a sudden. 
"Who in God's name are you? come in here patting my tummy like I'm some sort of Buddha, and than making raspberry sounds at me?! I could have you arrested for harassing an esteemed member of the community and humanitarian of .... 
aw shit. 
I barely have the lungs for it any more. 
They got me on all these downers. 
Not to bad though. 
It's not the usual saline mix they give me to pump me full of their future drugs. 
Who the hell knows what they put in there.... 
what was it you said your name was?" Bierbach was obviously high as a kite, and Charles realized the drug down would most likely cause Old alfie to stop trying. 
The old boy needed pain! He needed friction and a fight and a reason to be a pain in someones ass, so Charles decided to do what he could to hurt the old monster. 
"You abandoned my mother and now you send a ghost to summon me that you might die in comfort of having met your offspring?! ."
"I did no such thing. 
I am in no communication with any ghost." Bierbach paused mid thought, realizing his dream, and how there were words when he breathed in the mirror like that movie with harrison ford. 
Old Pewtie had arranged this. 
Than the dream had been real. 
And this was the boy. 
"Well I hope you brought a paternity test, because I'm not the type to sign over my entire estate of 5.89 billion dollars worth of holdings and blah blah and blah blah and..." Bierbach droned on for what felt like minutes naming off the various economic terms for money. 
real estate and start ups and libraries and police balls, he mentioned a lot of police balls. 
I don't get it. 
oh wait. 
I remember, yeah I do.
finally he came to arrest, and Charles was about to reply. 
"I only came so that the ghost would leave me alone. 
Not so you'd give me your money when you die. 
Also, look at this here. 
See how your chart has your daily meds? only 10% are addressing the problem. 
the other 90% are all lessening the pain, and upping the attention since the pain killers are downers. 
and regulating the kidneys because those two in combination really puts strain. 
and relaxing the intestinal tract, because all those cellulose casings can really gum you up. 
And ... 
have them keep you at 100% dose on what's causing your cure. 
Have them wean you off of everything else. 
Oh, and don't bother calling me. 
I'm not interested in seeing you. 
Write a book for me to read when you're gone. 
Something like that. 
i don't think I could tolerate meeting you except in this situation, where you're doped out of your mind, and I'm still adjusting and kinda shell shocked from all this bizarre types and levels of human interaction, ... 
It's surreal enough that I can deal with it. 
Anything more and I'd rather not though."
Charles the Bard turned and left. 
the old timer was scrawling something onto a piece of paper. 
the head teenager, sammy, walked up and took the piece of paper. 
"Bring the boy to this address. 
Tell him it belongs to him now, and I won't visit him there . 
well, tell him I may drop in, but we'll have some kicks." The teenager took the scrap and ran outside to rush Charles the Bard to this random address. 
When marching orders come so fast and thick and unexpected and interesting, it's hard to say no. 
Even to a blind launch into yet another unpredictable surge of infinitude and grotesquely unpredictable mayhem and boohahas.

37. 
"You've seemed a bit down lately cuz. 
they given you a hard time about them horns again?"
"Oh, Nah Jack. 
Nah. 
They've come to accept and appreciate the horns as I do. 
Ever since I chased off those hikers, man, did you hear them shrieking through the woods? As long as I'm here this place is safe. 
No one will wanna come check out an abandoned resort haunted by a devil. 
"
"A short fat mexican devil. 
"
"I'm not short or fat! And meeeyah!  Fuckin domestication. 
I can't do this man. 
It's great out here, like permanent summer camp. 
but I can't do this. 
I gotta think of Matilda. 
She's right, I may be deformed and such, but I gots to be plugged into actual normal city life. 
I have my bar, and I have a job that will just think I was in jail for a week and let me come back. 
I have Matilda, and I'm pretty sure if I get this next raise she'll start thinking about popping out a little wilson."
"I don't think its safe to reproduce if you have horns... 
 ever mind. 
I'm sorry. 
That's fucking great! You really think you're willing to leave this behind? ...
"Matilda's waiting for me, and I can't ask her to quit her life and come move to the wilderness to live like lord of the flies with us."
"Yeah, and besides. 
You already DID ask her, and she said no."
"Yeah, that to." Frankie and Papa Charles were playing handball across the close cut lawn. 
On the concrete patio. 
The late afternoon sun was just cresting the upper mid part of the bullshit word counter that's planted itself in your unfortunate author's brain. 
"It''ll all be deleted tomorrow. 
" He repeats to himself. 
"I'm starting over like I always do. 
Right back where I always end up, because that's where I belong." and this is also what Wilson was repeating to himself as he loaded up a backpack, hugged his cousin Jack good bye, and set out for highway 1 to make his way back to Matilda and her ten thousand english gardening bunnies, and their ancient bureau and the mini fridge end table that was so subtle and stylish and held 3 beers, which was exactly how many Wilson liked to drink in one sitting. 
He had to admit, he was returning to a life that it took him what felt like centuries to modify into a perfection. 
akin to transcendence. 
And he knew he was returning joyful and ready to be there every day, for the job, and for the wifey, and for the ... 
well, he did keep his life fairly simple. 
That was all he had to worry about. 
Job and wife. 
And the sound of Wilson...................'s thoughts died out as he made his way towards the sunset and towards his woman and towards his future which was similar to his past, but much more full of joy and gratitude and pleasance. 
Jack looked after him, silently wondering the same question that continues to plague the author and anyone who's ever met Wilson, Why the Fuck does he have Horns?!?! It just seems like it's supposed to mean something, but it end sup just hanging there, like a jellyfish in deep space, immune to the expectations of the audience.
40,000
...........................................
38. 
BAP! gazoingazoing... 
 BAP! gazoingazoing. 
The sounds of hand ball reverberated up and down the resort. 
Jack lounged on the cliff chairs, unheeding to the Bap and gazoinging, Ned lay in the lounger next to him dozing happily, free from his self inflicted fate finally tapping in to the pleasance that surrounded him Wilson was gone. 
the place seemed much less lord of the flies and much more swiss family robinson without his gargoyle silhouette.
The bird s and ants continued through on their daily patterns immune to the variation in soundscape. 
The hand ball zinged and whacked and careened from Frankie's paw to the floor to the wall to the floor to Papa Charles who executed a perfect double backie wrap around flail, sending it bouncing and spinning and disappearing of out past and over the cliff edge. 
. 
"Awww. 
You lost the ball!"
Frankie moaned.
"You missed the pass. 
I simply executed a perfect double backie wrap around flail. 
You're the one who couldn't keep up. 
" . 
" They looked around as if they had just woken up. 
Silence had fallen, without the ball to keep a random rhythm. 
. 
Jack and Ned seemed unfazed by the change. 
The Lost Resort dawdled on through misty autumnal breezings as the days drifted past their early retirement,kicking through branches and skittering leaves. 
......................
39. 
Bierbach knew that the swamp creature claiming to be his son was right about the meds. 
He decided it was advice worth taking, but he also decided that he wanted to go on one more magic morphine carpet ride through the haze of handy button fed pharmaceutical sugar cereal for the rich and dying. 
The hospital knew he wasn't in danger of passing away this time, or any of the other twenty five times he'd come in for minor problems. 
But they also knew that he owned the hospital, and thus was given whatever treatment he decided was reasonable and called for, and usually it was neither . 
He hit the button a couple times and felt a warm rush of whatever morphine does. 
The room faded through several colors including pink and green before disappearing altogether in a swirl of off white walls and pastel linoleum. 
Bierbach swam through the head space, almost expecting to breach some sort of surface to this amorphous liquidy presence. 
Far off in the blue green distance he saw something else floating along, similarly buoyant and directionless, but aimlessly making its way in Bierbach's general direction. 
It seemed to be a young man. 
A young man that Bierbach quickly recognized as his old partner Pewterschmidt, only quite young. 
Practically pubescent. 
"BEGONE SPIRIT!!" Bierbach screamed at the drifter. 
"I have no use for your presence or inputs! Why do you wish to haunt me?"
"I wish to help you avoid the failings i have found in myself Alfie. 
I'm only visiting you so that you won't fall into the same torment I discovered. 
" Bierbach snorted, but since he couldn't control the drifting any bit at all, he decided to give in and let the old bastard in a young body relay what messages he wished. 
"It was a close one alfie, I only just barely got your son here. 
He wasn't about to listen to a ghost, even though his ears were unstopped and he could feel and hear the efforts I was making. 
I even found a few other ghosts who also had their designs on some how arranging for Your boy Charlie the Bard to become some sort of world leader! Now that's all nonsense, as I'm sure you're aware. 
We dead people don't have any agency in the land of the living, we can only hope and pray and haunt and pry our wills into the minds of normal every day humans. 
Do you know what percent of your thoughts are yours and what percent of your thoughts were planted by spirits? "
"Don't ask me these double talk questions, make me doubt my own agency. 
I know what I believe and I know what I want, and I know how to justify the two to each other. 
I don't need to wonder and worry whether or not my body is being taken up by a spirit with similar equations floating around in its thought box. 
What is your wish spirit? Make it be known, and leave me be. 
I don't wish to dwell in the past. 
I have a life I'm trying to end, and you are only confusing and conflicting the matter with your concerns about a world that ought to be entirely irrelevant to you. 
"
"Ah, Alfie. 
Always the functionalist. 
Only what is stark and literal, only what is true and applicable. 
No wonder we were such a brilliantly ruthless pair of industrialists. 
I'll be brief. 
I
ll make my point, and drift back into the ethers to leave you to your slow and joyless demise. 
You will be joining me soon Alfie, and you must make amends and bury your skeletons while you still have hands and feet to do so. 
You must use all your money Alf. 
That's the main thing. 
If you die and are left with 5 billion dollars worth of assets, your spirit will be incapable of leaving this realm. 
Like me, stuck halfway in halfway out, playing the hokey pokey trying to arrange a fitting finality for all those dollar bills. 
They shall go to Charles the Bard. 
And you must create a spending schedule for him, so that over the course of ten years he will invest half of it and spend half on libraries and schools and weapons reuse programs, where the guns get turned into farming equipment. 
Remember that -project? I always liked that one. 
"
"Yeah, until old Seymour shot his foot off with a shovel. 
It's all very clever and cute, but sometimes that can get you killed!""
"Alright, so skip the weapons reuse program. 
Just focus on the information garden biodynamic intelligence dispersal units, and the smart yurt foundation, and the Chautauqua circus expo. 
DO THINGS ALFONSO!! DO MANY AND WONDERFUL THINGS WITH YOUR REMAINING TIME AND THAT MOUNTAIN OF MONEY!!! Do not just fester, do not just stew. 
your internal interest is all made up of bile and spit, vinegar and gasoline. 
It's only your ornery obstinate avarice that keeps you alive. 
Once you let that go, you will die calmly and happily, not locked up like a fucking jigsaw chain mail gut fist... 
And listen to your son. 
I don't know why he knew all those drugs, but he's right. 
They'll kill you if you let them keep pumping you full of chemicals like that..." And Bierbach drifted further and outwardlier into his morphine cocktail draze.
.....................................
40. 
Cascading rain, mud hills crumbling and swirling, branches crackling against each other, the sky gray and black and burning with energy, the part of big sur known as the mess was living up to its name. 
Jack the cop trudged along through the mud and the mess unsure how the hell he had gotten there. 
He no longer knew what he had been in his past life. 
Sleep deprivation malnourishment and general rugged ragged ruthless incompetent survivalism had left him a shell of his former self. 
He couldn't light a fire, he couldn't find dry shelter, he couldn't hunt, he was only saved by the water he sucked out of his soaking shirt. 
The hill he plodded up was as slick and mudful as any proud swamp, only it lay on a 45 % angle. 
Jack had forgotten his name, he had forgotten that he was a cop,a nd he was quickly forgetting that he was human. 
How could his concept of self have crumbled so suddenly? How could he have disappeared into such a limbo of facelessness? He knew not, nor could he ever consider such things in his current state. 
He slipped. 
He skidded down on his belly backwards to the bottom of the mud hill where he crumpled sadly against a redwood sucker forest. 
He gasped out a painful yelp. 
poor mewling bastard. 
But what's this?! at the top of the hill!?! Someone in home made snow mud shoes! Wrapped in a tarp like some forest dwelling plastic sheikh. 
Jack the cop's eyes lift heavily, and he thinks he must be hallucinating. 
This must be the keeper of the after life. 
The gate watcher. 
The key man. 
Jack's glad. 
he's ready for it to be over. 
He lets his face flap splooschk into the mud. 
This superficial physical shell is all that's left of our dear brave officer of the law. 
He has given his all, and he did his job to the best of his ability, and now the gods of nature have seen fit to feed his corpse to the hillside. 
The plastic sheikh takes a side trail that zig zags down the side of the mud hill. 
A rather easy route that Jack had neglected to search out in his slipshod slapdash towards higher ground. 
The plastic shiekh steps heavily up with his home made mud snow shoes, which seem to be tennis rackets with knobby wooden cleats screwed to the rim. 
The plastic sheikh bent over and hefted Jack the cop over his shoulder, and slowly struggled back up the switch back trail to the top of the hill. 
The hill crested and continued on along a lower ridge that crept up the edge of the mess back to the Lost Resort. 
.....
The teenagers had't expected rain, but they were young enough to live through a day of or two of physical abuse at the hand of the wind and rain. 
Charles the Bard was used to this. 
He barely noticed the rain, more intently interested in why the teenagers would be taking him back to his origins of Big Sur. 
Could they have known that He had already seen his fill of settlized citizen life? Could they really know that all he wanted was to return to his sweet immense natural and ruthless home in the santa lucia mountains? He didn't care. 
He knew the mountains they were carving a path through, and he knew how he might return to some of his old and favored caves and lean to shelters and fire pits and hot springs. 
They rounded the corner and came to an abrupt halt. 
Sammy pulled the scrap of paper bierbach had given him, and checked the address against the number carved into the tree. 
He looked up and noticed a bike in the tree. 
"Alrite chuck. 
This is the place. 
Your new home." Sammy smiled proudly. 
A job well done and completed. 
Charles climbed off the bike and handed Sammy his helmet back. 
The rain spat down on them irregardless of land ownership or seniority. 
Charles's matty dreaded hair became saturated rather quickly, and Charles soon looked like a ragged rotten monster rat creature. 
"Thank you Sam." He said, and turned and walked down the muddy driveway towards the Lost Resort. 
.......................
Chloe pulled over. 
She pulled the car off the dirt road into an alcove of shrubbery. 
"This is it. 
According to the maps and the GIS website and the tax records of P & B, we just hike 2 miles north east of here, and we come upon the biggest most abandoned resort where those two cut throat economic shark vultures built their paradise before destroying their lives and brains after which they closed it up like a crypt. 
I'm sure it's some sort of Taj Mahal in homage to their wealth, eternally empty, eternally in memory." Jass smiled at Chloe's interpretation. 
"So how' did you find out about this whole gig?" He asked.
"I was a researcher. 
My job was to dig through tax records and ownership records and assets and such to identify anything that might be trying to be hidden. 
After awhile I noticed that there are certain patterns, and fads. 
The term "laundering money" refers to the fad in the 60s for folks to invest
42,000
in laundromats, and than claim all their money came from quarters. 
Being high on the hog was what they called in in the fifties, because they would invest in pork futures. 
In the seventies it was known as building a fish tank, because ... 
well, that's because it was a bunch of acid dealers who didn't under stand how laundering worked, and ... 
well, never mind."
"You k  ow, it's been a fuckin decade. 
and you're still the rip roarin rocket booster babe that caught my eye and mind and attention and faith and soul so long ago. 
I haven't been with anyone since."
"Not even your own self pleasure attentions?" Chloe asked as she stepped out into the rain, protected by her military issue rain gear. 
He stepped out as well in similar garb and they grabbed their survivalist backpacks. 
"Well, old lefty does get itchy, and the arch duke does get demanding some mornings. 
I suppose it did occur. 
"
They disappeared into the bushes and into the woods and up the hill and along the ridge into the Mess, towards the Lost Resort. 
........
Bierbach was off the dope. 
He felt strong and angry. 
Aggressive and infinite. 
He had a son, and he was gonna fuck with him a little. 
payback for getting abandoned by the mother. 
Bierbach missed Charlotte, and this Charles character almost seemed an affront. 
Practically named after the mother, practically a living homage to her distaste for Alfonso. 
Bierbach hung up the phone and yelled. 
"JAMES!!! Take Care you don't raise my IRE! There are behaviors that you've taken part in that are grounds for me discontinuing my patronage of your uselessness. 
There is an article that says you have to care, and your lack of presence at the hospital show that you don't actually care. 
I'm going out. 
I'm going to reclaim the Lost Resort, something you've never heard of, and will never know about. 
Keep the hounds in the yard, keep the doors locked, and don't answer the phone." James and Leroy were comatose on the couch watching The Fast and Furless 7, a foul porno about people banging on the side of the road. 
Neither of them responded. 
3 swat vans pulled up to the doors of Bierbach manor, and Alfonso walked out the front door and got int he front seat of the first one, and off they went to wards the last resort, where alfonso planned on getting his son arrested for trespassing, and falsely imprisoned before anyone could find out it was Bierbach's son. 
Alfonso had no reason to do this except for the fact that anger kept him alive, and he was angry at Charlotte, and Charles was her son. 
Bierbach wanted to lash out and he wanted to be ruthless and heartless and godless and powerful. 
What use is billions of dollars if you don't have your own blackwater, and you're not allowed to destroy your own son? It was like the old days five hundred years ago, when kingdoms were constantly in flux, and shakespeare told the true stories that BIerbach aspired to. 
True real political chaotic intrigue betrayal obsession and death death death.
...........
Frankie Papa Charles and Jack the Slacker had taken refuge in the cafeteria , and were playing rummy and watching the rain. 
A mud river had started flowing across the bowling green and off the cliff. 
It had taken on a midevil pauper wreckage zombie chaos sort of vibe, and the boys were fittingly lurking. 
The solar only had two batteries, and were being conserved for emergencies, so their card game was candle lit accompanied by stale chips and cold canned refried beans. 
they had all the supplies to build a fire, but they lacked a outdoor overhang, and didn't want to smoke up the cafeteria. 
Jack was bored of pinochle. 
Frankie and Papa Charles took to it like they were still in the yard. 
the rain didn't give a fuck. 
a figure emerged. 
a tarped figure with a body slumped over its shoulder. 
The figure was the tarp shiekh, and he waded the mud river, almost losing footing and getting swept along towards the cliff, but luckily slipping forward and launching the body onto safe ground , barely slipping and schwarfling its way out of the mud as well to lay panting twenty feet from the cafeteria door, which was ajar. 
Jack leapt up and ran to assist the two forms. 
They looked hilariously bizarrely non-human, like a teleportation gone wrong. 
Frankie and Papa Charles quickly noticed the hullabaloo and ran to help. 
the two felons grabbed Jack the cop who remained incoherent, while Jack the slacker pulled the tarp away to reveal Ned, the retired ghost hunter, red faced and exhausted, covered in mud and pruny pruny pruny. 
he two stragglers were dragged into the cafeteria and laid out on tables, an. 
Jack the slacker ran to get extra blankets and find something to heat water. 
The blankets were easy enough, but the there was nothing to heat water with that Jack had any idea about, so he simply returned. 
Ned was coming too. 
"Gah!" he hacked, spitting up a mouthful of muddy phlegm. 
"That fucker is heavy! He only looks like a normal size, but I bet all that water, and the fuckin gut on him, he must be close to 250 pounds right now. 
is he alive?" Papa Charles was checking pulse and feeling for breath, and thumping the chest occasionally, just for good measure. 
Frankie had recognized the body as Jack the Cop, and become reticent and reserved , silent and cautious. 
Was he in trouble for running from the scene? had he broken any laws? He couldn't quite tell. 
He felt cornered again, in his own resort. 
he did not feel good about this. 
Jack the slacker returned with cold water, a little disappointed that he couldn't muster any heat source, but cold water would serve certain purposes. 
He threw the water into the face of Jack the Cop who immediately sputtered to life. 
His eyes popped open like twin cans of pringles, and he just couldn't stop coughing and looking around frantically. 
"Get him some food. 
He seems rather ghosty." said Ned. 
Papa Charles ran off to find some food. 
"I think it's the cop from the crash scene." Ned declared. 
"Damn right. 
" agreed Frankie. 
"What the hell is he doing here?" 
"My guess is his partner never came back, and once everyone else had left he had no other option except to follow us in hopes that we might be surviving well. 
"
"We did a damn sight better than him." concluded Frankie. 
Jack's eyes were darting around like a cornered rat. 
He knew these were his same species, and he knew they were communicating, but something about understanding exchanges proved to be beyond his current capacities. 
He could tell some of it was about him. 
He felt a twinge of embarrassment, that it might be about how badly he did trying to survive. 
He knew he was going to live, and this calmed him down rather quickly. 
These were not wolves, they were not bobcats. 
They were not the cold and the elements. 
These are humans, thought Jack. 
These are creatures who want me to survive. 
They will take care of me. 
they seem familiar. 
Perhaps they were in my past life, the one before I walked into the woods. 
Perhaps they know me. 
Frankie noticed the absolute confusion in the cops eye, and it relaxed him. 
Poor bastard doesn't even know what's going on. 
He's been in the woods too long. 
Frankie almost felt pity, but his instinctual survival tendencies wouldn't allow him to feel pity for a creature that might at some point compromise his freedom.
Everyone else in the room realized how broken the poor man's brain was, and when jack returned with more cold beans and chips, they simply sat all very quiet and watched him eat.
.........
Jass slipped. 
down the muddy driveway he began sliding, knocking into Chloe. 
She landed on his lap, and together they slid faster and faster towards the bowling green. 
Chloe began to scream. 
Jass began to warble out a holler. 
The door to the cafeteria was quickly gushing forth Ned and Jack and Frankie and Papa Charles. 
Jass and Chloe fell silent upon seeing the place occupied, even though they continued sliding into and along the mud river that led over the edge of the cliff. 
The four guys approached the mud and two of them waded through before the other two tossed the tarp halfway across, so that it spread the river. 
They held it just above the muddy water stream so that it wouldn't sweep them all along, and they braced themselves for impact. 
Jass and Chloe separated enough for them both to get their arms and shoulders hooked over the top of the tarp. 
Their backpacks had to be slipped off rather quickly in order to avoid getting pulled down by their baggage. 
They each shimmied to opposite sides of the mud stream, clinging to their life tarp. 
Jack was on the side that Chloe crawled out of, and didn't know her from Eve. 
Jass emerged on the opposite side, and remained unaware that his old regular at his old bar was across the mud river assisting his woman. 
They stood up and looked across the stream at each other. 
"JACK!! You old muther fucker. 
How in Gods name did you arrive here?"
"Jass?!?! Did you implant me with a homing beacon? I thought for sure you had become too reckless and lost your bearings."
"Aaaah, Jack. 
I was on a schedule of absolute obliteration, but  than you left." they fell silent realizing they werwe out trying to outdo the torrent noise of rain and wind. 
They retreated to the shelter of the cafeteria adnthere was cold beans all around.
.....
he rain continued unabated as the california refugees passed around blankets and beans and introduced each other and caught up on back stories.
"My name is Ned. 
this is Frankie and Papa Charles and Jack the slacker." Ned began as everyone settled in. 
"I'm Jass, and this is my woman, Chloe. 
We came here because its supposed to be abandoned, and we were hoping to move in." and by the way, who's old wild eyes over there?"
"That's a police officer who came to help us deal with a crash, but instead ended up experiencing his own psychological crash. 
I believe his name is also Jack."
"Yeah! I saw you had Jack the slacker over there. 
what's up with that?!" Jass wondered.
"I came here to get Wilson."" explained Jack. 
"But instead we picked up Papa Charles and went looking for treasure, which ended up being this place."
"And I followed Frankie into the woods when he snapped and escaped the presence of police force. 
Than the cop followed us, and got lost, so i got lucky and saved him." 
"My God, it's all just too fucking tidy." said Jass. 
"It's a fucking set up. 
Something is about to happen, and I don't think any of us will be happy with the outcome." they all looked at Jass expectantly, hoping he might have a prediction, what they might need to prepare for. 
"I don't know what." concluded Jass. 
Everyone's faces fell. 
"But I know it's gonna suck. 
I've been drawn into this sort of a situation before. 
last time it was a stoned narrator. 
This time I think he's just bored and desperate. 
He needs something to happen." Everyone pondered quietly the episode with the exploding goat. 
They weren't ready to taunt God anymore. 
The weather seemed to be the oppressive presence of the penultimate author, and they were not curious to see what else might be on the agenda. 
......
While they were watching, the sky cleared. 
sunlight streamed through an ever widening gap in the clouds. 
The driveway ceased its intermittent flooding. 
the mud river slowed to a slurdging trickle, and the sound of engines was heard. 
The refugees all walked out onto the bowling green which had become a green spongey marsh. 
Some of them looked towards the woods, pondering escape. 
Something was coming, and they were not ready to deal with what it might be. 
Jass looked down and shook his head. 
Chloe reached out her hand and took his. 
Jack the slacker glanced at the two of them, mildly panicked by their resigned behavior. 
Papa Charles looked up at the sky as if surrendering to his fate. 
Frankie and Jack the cop both were pacing frantically, caged animals, sure it would not end well for either of them. 
Frankie due to ancient trauma of false accusation, and Jack the cop from very recent trauma of him assuming he could deal with things he was obviously in no way capable of even processing properly. 
. 
. 
hree swat teams rounded the corner of the ridge. 
First one, than another, than another. 
all slow and spooky like that. 
In the front of the front one, Alfonso leaned forward towards the windshield with a grimacing grin of victory on his face. 
. 
. 
Frankie knew he was incompetent in the woods. 
He knew he had gotten lucky stumbling across this place, and even luckier finding friends and being joined by competent strangers. 
But he also knew that at some point someone had betrayed their position. 
Alfonso rubbed his palms together, and paused confusedly upon seeing the crowd. 
 one of them looked like his swamp creature son. 
Who were these refugees and what were they doing on his private abandoned shangri la? These were pawns interfering with his assassination of a rook bastard and Alfonso knew no other strategy except to compromise with extreme.... 
vengeance? Full steam ahead, all the stops out, ruthless reckless, no prisoners. 
Well, actually they would all be prisoners. 
The Swat trio ground their heavy way down the grouty shloop . 
the 4x wheels unhindered, keeping grip, controlling the slow descent. 
the group was motionless, frozen by some great hand by some unspeakable omnipresent sentiment of inevitability. 
...
The lead Swat team came to a stop in the middle of what had moments before been a mud river. 
Bierbach emerged, in a spiffy spotless white suit. 
The ice cream man. 
The guy in that movie who could conduct electricity. 
Bierbach's smile was the smile of a shark. 
the smile of the old wolf meeting little red. 
the smile of a dictator saying good bye to some upstart rebels. 
as he stood there smiling the all the swat team members emerged and gathered around him like the flying v. 
 one of them had insignia or badges or anything of the sort. 
they looked well paid and ruthless. 
They all held automatic rifles and wore vests with a wide variety of weaponry attached and hanging off and sticking out of the dozens of pockets and clasps and pockets. 
Ned wondered about how obnoxious it would be to try and crawl through the bushes with all those hooks and snags and accouterments, but he kept his thoughts to himself. 
..
"WHERE IS MY SON?!?! shouted Bierbach. 
"I CAME HERE NOT FOR YOU PITIABLE WRETCHES< I CAME FOR MY SON!!!" the crowd stood mute. 
"ANY one of you leads me to my son, and you will go free. 
Anyone who has no information on my son will be arrested for trespassing, breaking and entering, aggravated robbery, and squatting." The crowd paused for three seconds before suddenly (yes, suddenly) breaking into a tumult of rabble and hollerfest.
"I did nothing!" "I was under the impression" "We don't know you!" "Prove you own this place!" "I have a family. 
I can't be persecuted. 
" "I"M NOT GOING BACK!! NEVER!!" "This place was abandoned. 
We are making use of a neglected resource." 
The swat team spread out and there were 2 swat members per refugee, and they all went quietly, accepting their hand cuffs and being gently loaded into the back of the paddy wagons. 
Bierbach checked all of them in the face, looking as if searching to see if any of them might be his son. 
The most scared was definitely Jack the cop. 
He had stumbled out of one nightmare into another with barely a moments respite between occurrences. 
The vehicles all loaded up, Bierbach climbed back into the front seat of the front swat car, and they slowly made their caterpillar way up the muddy driveway around the edge corner cliff hill and back towards a more normal version of socialized citizenal life, where laws were laws, and sidewalks were sidewalks. 
Back home where heat comes from the gas company and food comes from the supermarket. 
And human contact comes from your television set. 
And community is maintained on facebook. 
Thanksgiving was coming up, and the swat members were all grumble gutting about what they were going to eat. 
The prisoners listened in, wondering what their own thanksgiving would have been like. 
Cold beans and mud swimming? At least Jail would be a complete meal, and there would be no mud. 
A shitty excuse for a bright side, but better than nothing. 
At least they weren't burdened with freedom and autonomy and self reliance and the infinite sky and the ruthlessness of nature. 
At least the hamster cage is predictable, even though it's populated by ten million variables that could be undergoing unprescedented pressures from the ten million variables with which they've been taught to adapt and thrive and coincide. 
Silence fell upon the last resort. 
Somewhere up on the hill, just a few yards off the driveway, way up on the top in a perch where you could see not only the Lost Resort but where its driveway connected to the main road, Charles the Bard sat watching, completely fascinated by the way these humans had chosen to interact. 
Such subservience combined with fear. 
such meaningless power combined with senile rage and impotence. 
Charles the Bard began to humm softly
Charles the bard began to humm softly as the
45,000
rain began to quietly trickle down again. 
 he hummed almost as if he were humming the rain back into existence. 
His hum became a howl, and his howl became a holler, and soon he was singing again, something he hadn't properly done since the death of his fox.
"I cannot ride the ramble fury false and furious I crawl through tumult glorious I found it all beyond the walk and through the howling winter life that leads to springs of joyful lux and flaunting faith we carve a place in natures bowels so strong and wooden lost in falling water where we cannot be held beholden to all that we once felt compelled to be part of and finding the faith to pursue things we haven't been true to nor craved any news of, it's all just a game again, letting the rain in and wander fish ponder fool back through the tumult...
Charles turned his back on the last resort and walked quietly, happily, lastingly back into the part of big sur known as the Mess.
...........
"Change IT!" blurped a voice from the mass of blue and green, bean bag and blanket. 
"This sucks! Change it BACK!" there was very little movement at all in the entire room. 
The voice of change continued without stirring. 
"I hate this show! I don't wanna watch it anymore. 
It'
s not funny, and the actors are ugly, and it has shitty commercials!" The room remained disinterested in the voice's opinions. 
The television also continued blaring the objectionable program despite the voice's protest. 
Pizza boxes littered the room. 
You could walk from one end to the other of the massive cushy luxurious lounge area only stepping on the scattered cardboard. 
The room was otherwise well put together, with all the thick chardonnay curtains with golden tassels and ropes, the mahogany end tables and leather bound books. 
It truly was an homage to excess. 
The books remained disinterested in the comments being whined out. 
The carpeting lay there uncaring. 
A hand emerged from the pile. 
a struggling greasy hand still clutching a spoon. 
It seemed to embody the resilient spirit of overheating, in the face of all that is good and decent, despite the consequences and impossible disproportionateness of all the mumbo jumbo comparisons , eating too much. 
always in style. 
always in season. 
The hand was connected to an arm encased in flannel, but lumberjack flannel as opposed to sleepy flannel. 
 The flannel was also covering a torso which soon flopped up like a beached whale, and our hero Leroy showed his ruddy now chubby face, sleepy with comfort, lethargic with binge eating, and irritated by the fact that once again, James had put on family channel melodrama and left. 
Why did James continue to torture poor leroy this way? Was he not grateful to have a new friend? Did he not appreciate the camaraderie and friendship of spending days at a time gorging on pizza, lounging in the pool, binge eating ice cream, and rolling around like porpoises, too full to sit up straight. 
? Leroy felt neglected and abused. 
This was no way to live, with a distant and obnoxious house mate. 
What did he expect to happen? They go on adventures? Leroy had adapted to James's diet and schedule as if he were born for it. 
Wake u p-around noon, waddle out to the front yard, watch the sun as it approaches its apex, scratch a bit, have the butler bring you coffee and orange juice followed by waffles and cookies, followed by breakfast burritos and nachos followed by philly cheese steak sandwiches and potato salad, followed by ribs and macaroni salad followed by easy mac and hot dogs followed by pizza and pizza and pizza and ice cream... 
followed by another nights sleep. 
of course, there was the customary nap interspersed between each meal, and sometimes they had enough energy left to go dip into the pool or the hot tub. 
It didn't matter. 
They could just loaf in memoriam in the movie room channel surfing indefinitely without a care in the world. 
Leroy smirked and crawled over his blanket pile and hit mute on the remote control. 
He would have to hunt James down and find out what gives. 
Did James have some sort of a plan? Wasn't he next in line to inherit? Why would he even bother moving, when all he had to do was loaf on the gravy train until it arrived at his harbor? Rich people got funny brains. 
As Leroy stooped over and pushed himself up out of the bean bag chair like a grotesque behemoth beluga emerging from sea foam to flop crappily onto the beach, he blurped. 
That's where you are surprised by a burp, and your sound of surprise is combined and warbled and confused by the air escaping. 
Leroy stumbled over to the book shelf and pulled on a very specific one. 
It flipped back into place, being a secret automatic lever, and the whole bookshelf scooted automatically back 4 feet to reveal a subterranean staircase leading to a hidden chamber. 
................
Jack the cop came to. 
He huddled deeper into his cot and tried to ignore the singing. 
Those bastards were always singing, and Jack the cop simply could not conceive of why. 
There was nothing to sing about in this pit of despair. 
Nothing at all, and they continued yarbling their ceaseless praises of good wine and cheap friends, Jack the ex cop frowned and buried his face deeper into his pillow. 
From the jail hallway someone yelled. 
"Jack!" Jack didn't move. 
"Hey Jocko! It's your partner, Dan!" jack remained impassive, unhearing, not realizing it was to him the voice was speaking. 
"Come on Jack, you're not undercover. 
What is it, you avoiding the old lady?" Jack finally lifted an eye to see who might be speaking and to whom. 
Dan stood in the hallway, gripping the bars to Jack's cell. 
"Come on Jack, cut this out. 
You've seen me every day for the last two weeks, and not a hint of recognition." Jack sat up on the bed and studied this new character. 
What might he want, and who might this 'Jack' be? Could this individual be accurate in assuming that jack was jack? Jack decided to play it safe. 
"I don't know you." Dan's face fell as Jack turned his back to him and looked out the window.
"Whadayamean, Jack? I'm your old partner! We were cops together! You're still a cop! That's why I left you alone when I first saw you, 'cause I assumed you were deep undercover. 
Turns out you got some kind of amnesia I'm guessing."
Jack had to admit, there was something familiar about the red headed squat little guy in the uniform. 
He seemed like a long lost relative or something. 
Jack's mind began to be populated with strange scenes from what he thought must be someone else's life. 
At a certain point in the last two weeks he had decided that he was a channel for all the lost memories that no one has time for. 
he had decided that he had no past, was merely an apparition representing repression. 
This seemed totally reasonable to him, because he felt like he had a job that he was obligated to refuse to do. 
This only made sense when he thought about it with his feelings and left the word thoughts out. 
Word thoughts tended to get in the way. 
Dan was adamant. 
"Jack! You don't seem well. 
I need to get you help. 
You don't recognize me, do you?!" Jacks eyes rested emptily on Dan's presence. 
"Nope." he replied, practically lizard like in his passivity. 
His thoughts were lost in a desert, watching a wagon train of pioneers circling at the approach of indians. 
He noticed the scene was caught in the frame of a window. 
he must have seen this from the safety of his own home. 
He must have watched. 
The scene was immensely far off, and Jack struggled to understand what was going on, finally, a voice chimed in. 
"there's something wrong, Jack!" the voice belonged to a short scrawny looking guy, excitable and funny when times were less survival oriented. 
The Jack he was speaking to was a tall man with an impressive gut. 
He held a rifle at his side, and fingered the pistol he still had holstered. 
"Yer right Winkey, We got the wagon trains already circling. 
We'll stick this one out like we did the last one." majestic music with lots of violins and trumpets surged up and drowned out their yells as all the men dismounted from their wagons and took strategic positions around the circle. 
Jack's minds eye moved back and he realized that he was watching this all from a different more recent time period. 
behind the window, inside the room his minds eye was in, it was a modern apartment, something which Jack still hadn't seen since the onset of his amnesia, but the sight of which triggered a series of other memories from the same room, but not through the tv. 
memories from the room itself, with characters talking directly to his minds eye. 
A woman, stealing the remote, a handheld device that controlled what went on inside the window that the couches were pointed at. 
It changed away from the teams battling on the field over a bloated pig skin or some such token, but the woman changed it to a woman in a chair, talking to four other women, also in chairs, and the subject matter was completely beyond his comprehension. 
The woman seemed disappointed with his use of the remote, and everything she said felt condescending and harsh. 
He hoped that his minds eye would change scenes again. 
It did, but sadly, it went to other memories of the girl. 
memories where they were on a hillside and she was throwing pizza
at him. 
He wiped the burning sauce and cheese from his eyes and forehead. 
He couldn't understand what she was saying because it was so high pitched and shrieky. 
His minds eye stumbled away, and than seemed to start running. 
it was running along a cliff above a beach overlooking a long stretch of fairground type skyline. 
A tower with a part of it that kept dropping making its occupants scream, a track that did a series of concentric spirals, each more undulating and convoluted than the last. 
A large spinning wheel that only rotated but didn't roll along anywhere, another circle that was laying on the ground and seemed to be populated by wooden horses. 
There were many screams, some full of glee, some full of fear, all of them lively and well fed. 
For some reason this stood out. 
The fact that these individuals were experiencing some sort of near death experience, but were somehow enjoying it and doing it on purpose. 
His minds eye shifted again. 
He was with the girl again. 
They were in the front of a car attached to the spiraling concentric tracks he had just been looking at from the cliff. 
The carriage lurched forward, and he heard excited squeaks and screams and exclamations from behind him. 
He turned to see a series of similar cars all linked together. 
As he was watching he saw another car come pulling up on a parallel track. 
The occupants seemed exhausted frazzled and happy. 
They were speaking excitedly about "remember the drop at the end?" and "that first spiral really got me seeing funny." and "the camera caught me totally off guard. 
I can't wait to see my face." His minds eye shifted again, and he was looking up at a row of screens, each of them showing a picture of people in the carriage rides, falling quickly down a steep section of the track. 
He recalled a flash occurring about there, and sure enough, there he was on the screen his minds eye was looking at. 
he was next to the girl, and they were kissing. 
He didn't understand that. 
They had done this ritualistic near death experience, and kissed at the scariest moment, and than she had thrown pizza at him. 
He felt like perhaps he had done something wrong, somehow caused the shift from this dramatic ritual to the other, much more dramatic ritual with the pizza toss. 
His minds eye shifted again. 
He was in the jail again, but this time he was on the outside, where the strange man going by dan was now standing. 
 He was standing there, and it surprised him to see Dan next to him, holding a teenager in cuffs, escorting him to the same cell that Jack now occupied in real time. 
He and Dan were discussing the teen. 
Jack felt sympathy for the teen, and anger at his parents. 
"He's nineteen man! and its just spray paint. 
Nothing serious. 
He's just trying to express himself." His minds eye seemed to be announcing. 
He recognized the voice as his own, and was interested in what he might be saying. 
Dan responded, in his minds eye, of course. 
"We don't get paid to analyze or modify the established system of law Jack. 
We get paid to carry out what our superiors have deemed to be the proper course of action." Jack sighed in real time as his minds eye sighed in memory time. 
Jack looked up in real time, and the flash back was complete.
"You're Dan?' Jack asked. 
Dan's eyes lit up. 
He gripped the bars excitedly.
"Yeah, Jack! You remember!! What do you remember?!?! Do you remember what those maniacs did to you? Do you remember if they really were satan worshipers? What about the Cult leader, Dark Charles?" Dan was extremely animated now, walking to the locked cell door and holding the lock as if it were Jack's hand. 
He seemed desperate. 
This made Jack feel powerful. 
he decided to keep it, perhaps use it as leverage to get Dan to unlock the door. 
Jack wouldn't do anything rash. 
His deep instinct told him he might be able to overpower Dan and run to the end of the hallway and push open that door, but Jack wasn't sure what was beyond that door. 
he remembered it was an office of sorts, with many people milling about, it was a thoroughfare stopping station, it seemed to be for sorting people. 
they had sorted him and the folks he had been taken in with from there, straight to this back room. 
He had decided against strong arming Dan, because it was such a risk bursting through the next door into such an unpredictable space. 
He decided to play upon Dan's affections. 
He seemed to like Jack, and Jack decided he should at least give Dan the benefit of the doubt. 
"Your name is Dan?" He asked, trying to initiate a level of agreeableness, but vagueness. 
He had never been in this sort of a situation before, to the best of his memory, which was a shredded mess of gibberish nonsense. 
"Yes Jack. 
Is that all you remember?" Jack weighed this question. 
He decided that the memories of the girl were irrelevant. 
He decided to go with the only memory of Dan that he had. 
"I remember a teenager, and you and I were locking him in this cell together. 
We were talking about whose fault it was the kid was bad." Dan's face became rather somber. 
"The only thing you remember is the time we disagreed about what our job was. 
God, you're being difficult Jack." Dan fell silent and stepped away from the door contemplatively. 
Jack realized he had somehow sacrificed his power role in the situation. 
He decided he'd better get it back. 
"Will you let me out Dan?" Jack asked, being as bland and normal as he could manage. 
This unfortunately was not very calm or sane looking. 
Dan was visibly bothered by how Jack had shifted. 
"I don't like being locked up." Jack concluded. 
"I... 
I'll talk to the boss Jack. 
But you haven't admitted to being yourself, and they already sent in a psychoanalyst, and you kinda failed. 
I dunno what those devil worshipers did Jack, but you gotta snap out of it first." Jack realized what was going on. 
The lady with the clipboard and the hair clip and the glasses and the pinched voice and the crossed legs and the redgray long skirt and sweater, and the tapping of the foot, and the clicking of the fingernails, and the scratching of the pen, and the grating of the questions, and the depth of obnoxious grinding metal on stone experience of interacting with her, she must have been a psychologist, something he recognized as brain expert, and she must have given his brain a failing grade, and that was why he was subject to this set of walls and bars and strangers and aggression and hunger and cold and boredom and suffocating limitedness. 
He knew he had done something wrong at some point, but for the life of him he could not figure out what it could have been. 
The only conclusion he could find was he had not been ready for it, and this had become the greatest sin of all, to think your good times will last forever, to think that bad times are never there. 
And now, he was caught. 
But he was finding new edges of his memories. 
Each new layer of psychological exchange he had with Dan seemed to be triggering pieces. 
New scenes for him to watch and study and try to understand and stitch together as his concept of self. 
"I . 
K think I know Dan. 
I think I can know. 
I don't know now. 
But I think if you help me, I can rebuild my memory bank. 
It seems like each memory is connected to another. 
I remembered a girl, and that made me remember a place, and that made me remember another thing which led to another scene with that same thing in it. 
So if we can just take the memories I currently have, and build them out in enough detail, they might be filled with clues and triggers that will lead to all those other forgotten pockets that we're trying to access." Dan had returned to the lock again, holding it hopefully, a totem of his hope to one day release Jack. 
Jack didn't trust him. 
He was just saying what Dan wanted to hear. 
He could only offer his memories as economic leverage in this bizarre unprecedented situation, and he wanted to start out by making them trust him. 
at the moment them meant Dan, and he knew that at some point he and Dan had been on the same side, but he couldn't let himself trust someone who was currently on the wrong side of the bars . 
He hoped to soon understand how he and his old partner might have changed behaviors so rapidly and which one might be proper, but he couldn't even muster the energy anymore to consider it. 
He was doing the minimum to keep Dan interested and satisfied. 
"Alright Jack! Let's do this!!! I bring up memories and you try to link it to others?"
"No, we gotta start with where I am." Jack replied. 
"We gotta go from the memory of the teenager, because that's the only memory I have of you. 
So explain it to me, and I'll explain it to you, and we'll ...."  
.....................................................
It's been three fucking weeks Dan! I remember more than you do about certain things!" Jack was exhausted and felt beyond abused. 
he felt like he had completely lost all control of the situation, and was at the end of his capacity to fucking figure it out anymore. 
This Bastard Dan was everything jack remembered and had forced himself to summon from the deep recesses of his traumatized brain. 
But he couldn't remember what Dan wanted, which changed every day. 
it was as if Dan was keeping a constant flow of new questions to ask, simply to keep Jack on his back foot. 
"I'm still your partner, aren't I dan? You've been making me remember for so long now, has it given you a chance to forget? We're partners Dan! We graduated police academy together 7 years ago! We had become an encouraging duo, and the sergeant recognized that. 
That
s why he put us together and gave you the C you didn't deserve, because he said I needed you. 
I still need you!" Jack stopped talking all of a sudden, realizing he was reinforcing the power paradigm he had been struggling to undo. 
..............................................
Alright, you wanna know Dan? It was the guy with horns. 
The guy you constantly keep asking me about, the guy you think is the leader of the cult, the guy you think caused an accident, arranged a random interaction between the felons who burned down his factory and than worked in his prison, you want me to say it was wilson, the guy who told me about his wife margaret and her collection of porcelain vermin, which is the technical term for rabbits, especially in places that are overrun by rabbits and are constantly having out breaks because of the diseases a flock of rabbits brings into your town and valley and area. 
It was the fucking demon. 
You're right! Anything more complicated is beyond you, you fucking monkey. 
You don't want to understand who the actual bad guy is, you just want to persecute the guy with horns! You just want to isolate and compromise the only thing around you don't understand. 
Of course you understand the Billionaire. 
He's rich! He won! and you understand James the leeeeech. 
he has the wonderful excuse of family, but he's just a leech. 
And you understand the redneck ghost hunters. 
they lead a simple boring life. 
they want interesting fascinating things. 
Dan gaped more intrigued than confused. 
He wasn't sure if this was new information or simply an accidental exposure of truthness. 
Dan was confused. 
He wasn't sure what Jack was doing. 
He had settled into his role as head tormentor, promiser of things that never come, always telling Jack that he was almost coherent enough to leave the cell, but Dan knew he had let it get away from him. 
And Jack was tired. 
he had not meant to release that tirade. 
he felt very hesitant to have released it. 
bothersome. 
weak he felt. 
"Never mind dan. 
You want to persecute me. 
you've made that clear. 
You've decided that you enjoy this strange exchange you've managed to generate between you and me. 
But no worries. 
I'll be meeting with the company nurse tomorrow, and I believe I remember enough to debunk your theory that my brain is broken. 
They'll let me go. 
I forgot to tell you Dan, I've managed to remember enough to realize what you're doing to me. 
You're holding your partner hostage. 
You are the only person who is
Dana laughed quietly, than louder, than louder, and soon he was bellowing anarchy out of his paradigm. 
I mean, diaphragm. 
"I'm the only one who comes back here Jack. 
they gave me personal control over your file, because it's so close to my heart. 
after all, you're my old partner. 
How could they possibly give any one else lead over your case? They look to me for approval. 
Not the nurse. 
they wont send the nurse in until I say it's safe. 
Jack suddenly looked terrified. 
his mind was flooded with  memories of Dan being ruthless and cruel. 
His opinion on the teenager. 
A subhuman who ought to be marginalized and punished, and ideally exterminated. 
He suddenly remembered the only way he could learn to deal with Dan's morbidity. 
Zanax. 
he was under emotional obligation to withhold Dan's dark tendencies from the company nurse who now treated him like a broken robot. 
He was under emotional obligation to care about this creature who now stood on the opposite side of the bars, and did not seem to feel any similar emotional obligation. 
and with some slight logical manipulations, he could justify his treatment of Jack as being faithful to his homage to the company. 
Jack shuddered. 
This was not the life he remembered, this was not the life he had found through forgetting. 
This was a very new and very dark universe he was suddenly aware of. 
He dropped his face into his hands and realized it was going to be a long time before he got back to finally exploring the memories he had finally accumulated. 
The sea of visual experiences that he almost felt were someone elses, but he felt he had the chance to go back and explore and to make his again.

.................
Wilson changed the channel. 
It had become boring to him. 
There was nothing exciting about Jews in New York City arguing about where to eat. 
He could not understand why Seinfeld had become such a lasting phenomenon. 
Weren't there other larry davids waiting to belch their miserableness on the world? Weren't there more Jason Alexanders waiting to embody that distasteful bitter bileful expression of human experience? Weren't there more Seinfeld's waiting to become famous mocking everyone else in their field? Weren't there more Julia Louise Drefuses, waiting to confuse the shit out of all males by complicating the concept of a normal female to the point where you just don't even fucking care anymore, as long as their cute and smart and can explain themselves better than a fifth grader? Wilson felt bad for being so rude with his analysis of Seinfeld. 
That's why he tried not to watch it, because he couldn't help dismantling it to the point where it felt like an insult having it showed to him as entertainment. 
Watch other people bicker in their livingroom? And obsess over irrelevancies? Isn't there enough in life as it is? The local news came on. 
Wilson could tolerate that more than international news, because it at least held tiny bits of relevancy. 
The majority was still mere masochistic pop, pulp,. 
pompous absurdity. 
Wilson knew that couldn't be helped, it was the nature of the very medium of television. 
he had to tolerate that at least, if he were planning on tolerating the fucking electrical hypnosis window hanging on his wall.
./.......
"IT"S ROCKY!!" Wilson suddenly shouted. 
It was so loud, Matilda dropped the ceramic rabbit she was holding. 
her paintbrush bounced off her lap onto the floor, leaving a trail of deep grayish green. 
"My gallop, Wilson, what is in you today?!" Matilda shrieked, leaping up towards the living room. 
"You have not been able to relax ever since your Big Sur drive." She leaned in the doorway with a concerned look on her face. 
"Look at it! Look at the television!" Wilson protested. 
" It's my RX &! It's Rocky!" matilda looked, and sure enough it was. 
A news crew had apparently found the crash site and was doing some sort of in depth analysis of the residue. 
"What in God's name are they doing filming your accident, Wilson? Why is your car on television?!?!" Wilson's eyes suddenly slumped and he looked almost hunted. 
"Goddamit. 
I'd better be wrong." He mumbled under his breath. 
But he was not. 
The news reporter blared out the analysis of all the information they had been able to drag up in order to make something interesting enough to show on television. 
"It seems there was a 3 car pile up on Coast Ridge Road, just off the One, waaay down south of Monterey, well, forty miles... 
but it seems it was staged! Some sort of demon worshiping cult staged the whole catastrophe in order to kidnap mister Alfonso Bierbach, partner of the late Eustace Pewterschmidt, the two of whom owned the PnB furniture factory, which later became PB Penal Colony, which also produced furniture." Wilson hit power, and leapt to his feet. 
(yes, he leapt to his feet, like so many other fucking characters int his story. 
Everyone is constantly leaping to their feet. 
Deal with it. 
If I weren't writing right now, i would leap to my feet. 
And guess what? I would SUDDENLY (yes, suddenly) run to the door. 
And check it to see if it was locked. 
And it wouldn't be. 
And someone would swing it open into my face, which is why I have a black eye. 
Fuck you. 
I'm writing this story.
Wilson turned off the tv and went back to his normal life. 
Dan realized keeping Jack hostage was the closest thing Dan would ever come to happiness. 
Leroy lived in the beanbag at James's house for the next fifty years, never even wondering about all the people he used to know. 
James became mildly annoyed at Leroy, but decided it actually was nice to have the company, even if it was a morbidly whiney, and obnoxious and shitty and such and so on...
The felons went back to prison, because the legal system was just so fucking unclear and biased and lazy and it just does that, because we suck at being humans for now. 
Maybe sometime in the future we'll be better...
and Ned... 
 Ned just was happy, because he had experienced the other side, and the prison walls couldn't get to him, because he had learned from his time hunting ghosts that the only way to be in heaven when you die was to be in heaven while you live. 
It doesn't matter what happens to ned, because he's happier than anyone else will ever be. 
meanwhile, the author sits wringing his hands, wondering if he left any off the bastards in a tolerable place. 
he feels like perhaps all the readers will be disappointed and shocked, and this is the goal. 
Readers must be left hanging readers must be lost at the end, wondering about their favorite character. 
We still don't know where the majority of characters have landed. 
We know most of them are in jail or not. 
We don't know if there is any sort of resolution coming for anyone. 
Would you like to know why? Because this is a demand from the author to the author to continue on later. 
We must give everyone involved a cliff hanger. 
we must fall eternally and faithfully towards the future, knowing the only happily ever after is based in the perpetual yearning for finding out what this leads to, and what comes from that, and where wilson will be when he finally feels guilty for abandoning the folks he became friends with, and how dan will feel, when Jack finally starts bringing up all the times he saved Dan from emotional physical and mental distress. 
We won't know until this epic is taken up again, and i assure you, it shall. 
the mionyety is still in centerpiece formation, and we'll get to the bottom of it, I assure you. 
just send any comments and evaluations and admirations and disavowing claims, and such and so on... 
so...
but for now... 
it must be the end.
---------------------------------------------------
CHAPTER ONE :: DOLORES, JACK & PAPS
Dolores never quite understood what the specifics of each ceremony meant, and while intrigued, she couldn't seem to see the meaning in all these peoples wailing and gnashing of teeth and their odd ways of cherishing ancestral essence which generally tended to end up blocking out any positivity, lost in the wailing, lost in the gloaming, lost in the lonely hollow hateful feelings of these strangers standing so lonely in the rain by the grave stones.
Dolores never asked any questions for truth, rather accepting the fact that any individual's answer was simply that : THEIR answer. 
When she was seven and eight and nine her uncle and father had continually filled her with unrelated theories and folklores about the origins of pot holes and why water flows down hill, and where all the buffalo went. 
She eventually decided that since her paternal relatives thought in such diverse unrelated patterns and saw such diverse stories in such similar triggers while being from such a similar origin, all truth must only be applicable the moment it happened, and afterwards was malleable mush in the hands of the experts who could look at ten thousand clues and prove beyond a doubt a dozen different ways how all this came about, and yet, Dolores knew that while it was all true, it was also all nonsense and projection. 
This is why she enjoyed here alcove of manzanita gnarl on the hillside above the graveyard where she was shielded from the eyes of prying strangers by the gnarled exploding branch arms that tangle the thicket of her hidden visitor viewing perch for watching strangers in ritual.
Dolores had been born at the mortuary, and was often surprised to hear that their sliver of rural perfection was rarely if ever found elsewhere. 
Mortuaries weren't like this anywhere, or at least that's what her uncle Jack had been saying the previous night over sangria and backwood cigars.
"There are places, practically every place but here! Where they are fearful and shun their dead! You see how the strangers come and wail?" He gestured past the bonfire towards the cemetery, beyond the field which would one day be full with yesterdays, stretching on eventually up to and including this very bonfire clearing. 
Dolores shuddered at the thought that one day there would be ghosts here. 
It seemed creepier to her to know of impending ghosts than to simply have an awareness of contemporary spirits. 
She realized when the graves came this far, she would most likely be in one of them, and somehow this comforted her. 
The ground under her felt electric and sharp with death, and yet subtle and calming, like knowing where you'll sleep tonight.
"These people out there, at the other mortuaries, they hold their dead at arms length to a galaxy. 
They can't abide the same space as their ancestors. 
Now what might THAT end up brewin and stewin in that jelly box brain we all been cursed with?" Jack sat back and sipped Sangria, and took a thoughtful puff on his stogie while his brother Pap, Dolores's Father, gave his retort;
"Now Jack, brains aint a curse. 
Brains keep us alive. 
They make us aware than our surroundings can help us transcend this primal nonsense of a zero sum game. 
Why, its the only reason we got enough sense to do what we do and keep what we got!"
"It's a curse. 
Animals got brains, but they aint cursed with em. 
We been cursed with bogey men of the intellect. 
Aint no fixin the circles a stubborn mind will find."
"So just because you go walking beneath a landslide you decide to curse gravity? Yer a fool Jack. 
You just drive yer brain the way you do Aaron's tractor, 'cept you aint responsible to no one but yerself fer wreckin it."
Dolores enjoyed listening to their psycho-anthro-philoso- rambles, but her favorite part was throwing in some sort of side question, that might dig up some realism. 
"Dad, do you find emotions to be a curse?" Dolores asked, feeling sure one of them had said such a thing before.
"Naw Doll, there's no curse except the curse of feelin cursed. 
That's what brings it on and makes it grow. 
A man might say he's cursed with clumsiness so he abandons himself to it. 
He stubs his toe, and in frustration He slams the door on his finger. 
This makes his eyes water up, and he can't see and trip going down the stairs. 
Than the nail he's been chewin on all morning gets caught on coat coat pocket and rips off. 
He curses himself by not just lookin around and stoppin and changing something."
"Aaaaaajh, sheddup. 
yer always talkin trash about me. 
Yer Pap, and I'm Jack. 
You got to be a family man, and I got to be Jack. 
You got to work this beautiful property, and I got to do Jack. 
I'm done! Dig yer own graves!! I need me! I need Jack~!!" Dolores quietly blushed, a bit ashamed that her innocent question had resulted in prompting emotional tensions.
""Oh, come on Jack. 
You get this way every time you drink Sangria." Pap called, as Jack stumbled off into the woods, a dark and dreary walk this time of night, 5 miles through riparian hills with a dozen deer paths bum squats and rabbit trails. 
"Jack!! Be Careful!~! "
"I'm Fuckin Jack! I'm NOT Fuckin CAREful! You Just SAID that!"
"I wasn't talkin about YOU Jack! I was just talking about how humans tend to make their own luck!!"
"Well than you'd better wish me someone else's luck!" he hollered, disappearing in darkness and rustling underbrush.
"He'll be fine Doll. 
He knows those paths like a snake knows its belly."
"That's pure tangle, and he's a lot bigger than me. 
I can wriggle through because I'm small, but he's six feet tall!"
"Well, he'll be easier to track in the morning than."
"Why is uncle Jack all bonkers like that sometimes?"
"I was always graceful, and I was kinda hard on him for natural clumsiness, and I guess I mighta convinced him."
"Can we unconvinced him?" Pap leaned back and looked l a bit sick for a moment.
"Now Dolores, we can't change people just because we don't think they're bein right. 
People do what they do because something about it is better than not doing it. 
At least in their mind. 
But the problem is, you can't convince someone otherwise, just by telling them they're wrong. 
Even if we could get him to realize I may have trained him into clumsiness, it would just be a new reason for him to resent me."
"Well, WERE you talking about him?"
"I guess maybe subconsciously. 
Not on purpose though. 
I guess I was looking for an example, and found one without realizing it was Jack that I was talking about."
"But we can't fix him?"
"Nah, nah! You can't fix anyone. 
Only yourself, and than just be ... 
Whatever that ends up being. 
I dunno Doll. 
I'm just a grave digger. 
I know the long term answer, and have gotten comfortable with that much, so the other stuff kinda seems silly to me."
"So you just found something that everyone ends up needing and invested?" Pap looked up a bit startled and perplexed. 
He ran his calloused stubby fingers through his salt and pepper beard.
"Well I suppose I did. 
In the end every man only needs six feet. 
Well, the fire is out, the sangria is gone, and I'm sure you've had enough of my stinky stogie soaking the air here. 
Shall we head back to the house?"
"I think I might go visit my tree if that's all right."
"Well, carry a club in case you see coyotes. 
And don't fall asleep there. 
Scared the dickens outa me when I had to go lookin for you at midnight last week. 
Don't be long."
"Alright Pap, flicker the porch light when you want me to head home, and I'll head back."
In half a second Dolores had bounded off into the misty darkness and was soon just a faint squelchy crunch ever receding and disappearing behind a sound screen of frogs and crickets, punctuated by hoots and howls of night birds and distant coyotes. 
It would seem odd for a father to grin and bask in the comfort of hearing his daughter tromp off into the nest of nature's night life, squawking and humming, blurping and gloaming... 
Yet it was the best possible spot he could imagine to raise a child : intimate with every process of life, the loiter, the flora, the laundry of recycle and cycle thru of death and rot and such, the starkness of reality in this setting was unavoidable, and Pap knew he was the wisest father in America. 
And in his mystic retreat of isolated silence he still felt as if every light in Vegas was on him while the crickets and frogs built an atmosphere sound blanket encasing everything where it sat in its complex whirring harmonies and counter point rhythmic randomness.
CHAPTER TWO :: THE DEAD RANCH
It was the slick eucalyptus at the top of the hill where I met her. 
My car had crapped out, so I had decided to car camp, and walked up the hill to investigate a view. 
My story writing voyage had been squirming into a narcissistic pissing match between my self obsession and self hatred, and I was about ready to ... 
To.... 
To fuckin pay attention to someone else for a change!!! It was awful.
Never have I come so starkly and miserably face to face with my own incapacity to actually look around and see humans who also happen to be the same fucking species as me. 
When did I lose this skill? Why is this so fucking hard for me?! Do I have asbergers or am I just an asshole? Is there a cure for not wanting to get caught up in other peoples nonsense? Is it a neurosis or a psychosis or a fuckin halitosis of the spirit? I feel as though I'm covered in my own bile, this experience of life drips down over my eyes and clouds my concepts of life logic self and salvation. 
Could it be that sending myself into a mud pit of shitty self obsession might be my only path back to an experience of love and light? I CANNot abide by this new logic I have spent years soaking up from those I disagree with those I exchange debates with, those who seem more logical than my puritanical parents and more active than my slothful crew of so many different places, ready for the porch, ready for the lemonade, ready for the long slow Sunday afternoon and lazing listless love the blisters they keep yer calluses real and ...
"Hi there!" My incessant illogic ramble was interrupted by a bright attractive greeting, coming thru a thicket. 
No form attached to the voice, just the scraggle brush back lit by the starry sky, a slight reflection of the pond seen intermittently thru the sticks, but the voice wasn't quite... 
Anywhere. 
I shifted around and coughed. 
Something moved in the tree above me. 
A small shower of twigs greeted my upturned eyes, and I quickly brought my knuckles up to try and rub the rubbish deeper into my ocular orifice, and by the time I had gotten my teary eyes clear of oak duff and dry moss, there was a girl standing before me. 
I couldn't guess her age. 
Between 19 and 40, I was sure of it, but beyond that, it's hard to judge by a silhouette. 
 "Hi." I offered, a bit awkward at having been caught in the bushes jotting down shitty flow of conscious poetry. 
"You live around here? I didn't see any other cars parked on the road."
"I live at the cemetery on the other side of the lake." She replied in a soft pleasant voice, but with a stiff edge somewhere in her lilt... 
An unplaceable primal competence that is never clarified but always obvious. 
Did I feel safer from wild animals, or in more danger of getting eaten by this attractive cemetery dweller.
"Why do you live in a cemetery?"
"Oh, not in the cemetery. 
In the mortuary next door. 
I was born there. 
I assume when I'm buried it'll be in the field where I first made daisy chains and rode bowser, our old greyhound."
"You had a bowser named greyhound? That's fascinating!" I was really reaching. 
Clawing desperately at my innermost humanity to connect with this silhouette who lived a classic cliche American childhood, only except in a mortuary. 
And the greyhound. 
That makes me want to leave town. 
SooooOOOOOoo badly. 
But that's my curse. 
I am lucky enough to wander, which means I see a lot of people, so seeing one person a lot of times means they become boring to me. 
Let me tell you, this is a sad and self destructive way to live. 
To let yourself develop an allergy to human connection is to let 9/10ths of your actual self die off, and this is what I had let happen. 
Suddenly my stupid brain loop had gotten back to something applicable. 
Maybe this girl could tell I was mostly dead, and might be able to help me confront this inner conundrum. 
She was still talking. 
Shit. 
I hate it when I accidentally tune out of a conversation. 
Back to life now buddy. 
Here we go. 
What's she saying?
"And Uncle Jack is never like that. 
It was just because the Greyhound threw me! "
"Was it chasing a cat?"
"No! A goat!! I knew you weren't listening."
"How could you possibly tell that? I'm just a silhouette! You don't even know me!!"
"I can still tell. 
Your breathing changed from conscious thought breathing to subconscious thought breathing."
"Holy shit! You have been out in the woods for a long time! I envy you this ... 
This sacred glimmery gloaming or what have you. 
Though it seems a bit on the isolated end of things. 
Out here in Mont.. 
Bizmu... 
Sacta... 
Where are we? I've been driving for about a week now, and can't seem to recall where I was when I broke down."
"You broke DOWN!" She queried with concern in her voice.
"We did. 
I mean, I did. 
It's just me. 
I had a buddy on the trip with me, but he bussed home so he wouldn't lose his job. 
 But I'm car campin. 
I'll find triple A in the morning. 
I just need to find out what town..."
"Well come back to the mortuary with me. 
it's just across this field. 
See the lights over there? My dad is home. 
He finished his bonfire, and I walked out here to listen. 
His name is paps."
"I'm not sure Paps is a name. 
 But I guess if that's what you call him... 
Why were you in the tree?"
"It's the only way to see the graves reflected on the water backlit by the stars. 
It looks more like it's supposed to that way. 
It makes sense. 
Like when you see a pattern from the wrong angle and finally when you see it from the right angle, it suddenly falls into the most obvious sense possible."
"That's very quaint. 
I'd like it if you showed me some time." I offered, trying my best not to sound aloof.
"Oh, once you see my horrible facial scarring you'll never follow me anywhere." I was mildly shocked, but intrigued by both the audacity to suggest such a thing, and the confidence with which she asserted this suggestion."
"Well. 
I just so happen to know a guy with a real scar fetish. 
Apparently he was raised by a bear attack victim, and his concept of feminine beauty is so Freudian he's attracted to facial scars." She chirped a stifled laugh, and was quick with her response,
"you'll have to give me his number. 
I've been relying on pity dates from Firemen." I snorted and pretended to turn it into a cough. 
We had tromped a bit thru some low shrub, and soon came out onto a moist boggy meadow. 
The dirt squirted beneath my sneakers and seeped in a bit. 
I wasn't bothered, happy that I'd soon be welcomed into a farmhouse mortuary in the middle of nowhere with a burn victim leading me to hospice... 
I mean, hospitality.
As we approached the porch light flicked on and a rustic looking pioneer man stepped out onto the porch. 
His beard was trimmed, his jeans were stained, his carhart jacket was a dark dark brown. 
I was glad he wasn't wearing a straw hat. 
Certain details just bother me.
"Whatchagot there Doll, a hoodlum? Or is it a haunt? I told you, only bring the live ones home."
"This one is live Pap. 
His name is... 
Well, I dunno his name. 
I don't even know what he looks like yet. 
All I know is his car broke down." This conversation was held in the dark while we continued on our way towards the house, clomping through boggy meadow in moonsliver shimmers. 
It felt like something off that one TV channel that always plays gunsmoke. 
Only it seemed more Gilliam or Burton . 
A sudden I glanced, and noticed a streak, a ridge. 
a bit of an extra something stretching from beneath her right eye down about almost to the bottom of her chin. 
I decided it must be fluttering hair in the moonlight, and not a scar. 
 ot that I was scared. 
I had met many beautiful scarred women. 
And they didn't scare me. 
Why would I be scared? And this old pioneer bastard won't mind me, since I'm obviously not going to be attracted to his daughter. 
Man, this stuff is always so neat until I get to know someone. 
I dunno how to deal with meeting people! This is why that first part. 
The leaving town, the desperate reaching for displacement, the sudden hope to be caught up in something, and the immediate decision that leaving as soon as possible is the best answer. 
Its obvious its ridiculous its cyclical and its boring. 
Shit. 
We're at the porch now, they're still talking, I'm scared to look over at her, and this fuckin Pioneer pappy is about to reach his mighty paw out to me and expect some kind of manly handshake...
But pappy's handshake was as soft and welcoming as the boggy meadow, and I could feel the boot of my cynicism quickly trying to loose itself in the welcoming envelopment of Pappy's emotional meadow. 
 "The name's Pa." He said. 
"Been out here burying the best people in the world, and rememberin the rest of em as well, for near on fifty years now. 
"
"Well congratulations Pap, sir. 
I wish I had that sort of consistency and presence and longevity."
"Most people do son. 
They just don't recognize it as bein here. 
They think its somewhere else. 
What's yer name?"
"Joe."
"That's a crappy name."
"Yeah, I had half assed parents."
"I heard somewhere, three letter names prompt a sort of genius. 
A sort of pixel logic ... 
Cellular. 
You know? syllable."
"I'm Dolores. 
And Pap is a ramble poet. 
Excuse his rabbit trails. 
If he starts one, it's a good idea to jot down what you were talking about before he commandeered the conversation and sent it hurtling into unrelated parallel abstractions."
"Holy crap! You two are quite a load of language. 
"
"Well, books are our main appetite here. 
The graves hold the bodies, the books hold the souls. 
Either way, whether it's the persons history or story, it never quite taps into the mystery or the essence of the person. 
Essence can only be patched in by extrapolating our own experiences and memories, which is what we do every time we read a book..."
"Did you jot down what we were talking about? He does it a lot." I grinned, and realized I hadn't even been aware of the scar on Dolores's face. 
It was exactly as I had seen in the moonlight, but so very subtle and topological, like a huge sleep line. 
It almost seemed to accentuate the gentleness of her cheek. 
On a different face it might be wrinkled up with anger sadness making the person look severely deformed, but the pattern it created made it seem almost like facepaint, as if her personality had transmuted the flaw into adornment.
"YOU're no mutant!" I grinned. 
She smiled in a way that didn't quite accept it as a compliment. 
Almost as if she was ready for the conversational jiu jitsu that was bound to follow.
"Why thank you sir. 
I haven't been showered in such compliments since the last great ball at our local grange." Pap grinned and took a step back, obviously ready to watch the verbal spar.
"Well, yer not near the side show my scar fetish friend would be into. 
He just wouldn't be into such undamaged goods."
"There's no such thing as undamaged goods. 
Which is why I'm wary about you Joe, no obvious damage. 
it must be subtle and very repressed."
"Oh, thoroughly repressed. 
I'm pretty sure that's what my name means. 
Vessel of repression, or some such thing." We moseyed towards the door behind Pap who pulled open the screen door and held it open while we entered in front of him. 
The living room was predictably rustic, the wood grain paneling making the sunken living room seem like it must be inside the trunk of the largest hollowest redwood tree, which it obviously wasn't. 
There were vases and house plants amalgamated around the room , framing an infinitude of bookshelves filled with every type of non generic looking book. 
Not a dime novel among the first few shelves, but there was a shelf off in the one corner full of crumbling paper backs that seemed mostly sci fi, framed in by a selection of succulents, cactuses and oversized stones. 
It seemed as if they had decorated by bringing their favorite outdoor alcoves into their livingroom. 
I walked down the three steps behind Dolores while Pap called from the kitchen, "Drink? We gots Ginger Ale and fine bourbon."
"Sounds magnificent sir! Put them both in the same glass, if you wouldn't mind." I called back. 
Dolores grinned at this, and crossed the room to perch on a high stool at a corner counter covered with paperstock and compasses and straight edges, charcoal and fine tip pens. 
It was nestled in behind a midget palm on one side and a burgeoning purpley green soft looking foliage waterfall, by which I mean, I don't know what kind of plant it was. 
But it was cool lookin. 
So I sat next to that plant, on a low couch of dark brownish red leather that was warm to the touch from the wood burning fire place with the metal tube chimney poking up out of the bare wood roof. 
She went to drawing immediately, as if I weren't there, and so I quickly became fidgety before even sitting down all the way, and decided to peruse the literature.
Every book was veeery... 
Appreciated. 
Not in value. 
In wear. 
The leather was ripped, the titles were faded beyond reading, the corners were knuckled into soft rounded edges, and some that I grabbed dropped pages like snake skin. 
 Pap soon returned and handed me my drink, but saw my interest and didn't interrupt, rather returning to his overstuffed arm chair with the same brown read leather as the couch. 
He picked up the book that had been lying spine up on the seat, saving his place and his place, and sat back down snuggling into the words of someone long dead.
"What YOU readin?" I asked, still perusing the 4th shelf, which was mainly americana and English Romantics and various other "revolutionary works like Joyce and Rimbaud and ... 
on and on, lost in that menu of human expression and experience known as literature.
"I'm gettin back into this Robert Anton Wilson guy. 
Every time I get a hankerin to go see the city, he reminds me what a bonkers mess it is out there in that infinite intersection of expression."
"Yeah, cities hurt my brain as well. 
Every "Welcome to city sign should have a Post Master General's warning ; unfit for human consumption."
"Oh, it's not my Brain I'm worried about. 
I have a brother who tells me brains are a curse, and there are times I'm inclined to side with him. 
I avoid the city because its bad fer the soul. 
The very core of you. 
The you of you. 
It diminishes in such a sea of selves. 
And I do not believe we were created to diminish."
"That's true. 
There's also the shimmering, though. 
I mean, a sea of diamonds is a sea of diamonds. 
One diamond is pretty cool, but a sea of diamonds is also... 
pretty cool."
"Ya can't see anything when there's that much of it. 
It all disappears from sensory overload. 
That's why you only read one book at once"
"And why TV shows can suck, 'cause you're generally watching at least 2 shows at a time. 
Hey, no screen!"
"We've got a screen in the backroom. 
Just a computer screen though. 
Nothin special. 
Just some internet capacities to aid us in our research. 
And Dolores finds the occasional show she gets a passing interest in."
"Have you heard of the Simpsons?" Dolores chimed in from her drawing perch.
"You have to be joking. 
They put the Simpsons on our FLAG last year! hadn't you heard?"
"I can believe that."
"They've been declared the new first and only family. 
the nuclear representation of a functional pixel of human culture... 
though I do enjoy them. 
A stellar lampooning of this the American empirical experiment."
"Wow, you talk like a shit head professor sometimes. 
You go thru some college?"
"Just enough to ruin my life."
"That's my boy! So How'd you end up wandering this far out into nowhere? Lookin to lose the ten thousand teachers?" He gestured vaguely at the book shelves. 
They seemed to leer down at me like those ten thousand teachers I disappointed by graduating. 
Bah! Human expression. 
A thin game with no end. 
A byroulean strip, or whatever that loop of paper is called. 
(mobius)
"Lookin to remember what I was before I decided I was something. 
I seem to remember a part of my life when it simply was, and that meant awe. 
And I wasn't even there in the setting with what I was experiencing. 
College fucked that up real bad. 
oh. 
sorry."
"Strong sentiment, strong language. 
College is just thought-crete. 
turns yer brain into whatever you decide is your permanent life purpose based on the prior 16 years of social programming. 
I hate to sound like those old hippies, but ... 
Ah, you know. 
yer young enough to resent anyone telling you what's good and right. 
That must be why yer out here, where life is life, and death is death, and the twain keep daily exchanges."
"Well come on now Pap, we can't ALL be pioneers. 
If everyone was spread out evenly across geographic America we'd never get anything done. 
Our culture seems to have a use for cities. 
Even your own thoughts and logics gain their energy from your resistance, and so even you are feeding off the energy of the city."
"Bah! Opinions. 
You're right Joe. 
Even engaging the opinion is tying myself to it in some way, when my life is perfect without ever dragging myself down with such considerations."
"So where does that leave you?"
"The purest form of anarchist : Language was our first mistake. 
I think the mind is still all good and wonderful, but it isn't the end all be all. 
It isn't going to save us if the world decides to end. 
Only accepting the larger pattern is going to get us through that, and that's a brain thing, but it's not a word thing. 
Very key difference. 
The only shortcoming of books. 
All they have in 'em is words. 
Words are like stones. 
When the mortar of humanity is no longer present, it became nothing more than a pile of rocks."
CHAPTER THREE :: LAUGHING PETER
Jack crawled up the final sandstone stretch to the ridge, and was welcomed with a blast of warm air and a shimmering star speckled sky of silky blackness and a side of lunar sliver astride the horizon. 
He wiped his shaggy Sam Elliot moustache and scratched his raggedy mane. 
The valley felt quiet tonight. 
Quiet but angry. 
Burning with the primal torment of survival, free from the sharp pains of social complication. 
A deep whiff told him that someone a few miles down to the south east was letting the last of their fire die down, burning what smelled like cedar. 
Must be the Larkin orchard. 
Jack paused long enough to soak in the scene, but quickly continued on a new detour : up and along the ridge instead of over the ridge and down into town. 
Jack knew he had never been there, but it seemed so similar to the old haunts he and Paps had pursued and cherished as children. 
There had been walls of carvings covered in sandstone faces they had hesitated to add to, wondering in their child minds whether it might be original American Indian artwork, and perhaps it was But that was a different valley a hundred miles from here. 
After an hour of hiking along the ridge, negotiating the occasional unpassable shrubby snare by climbing a tree or belly crawling, and finally, Jack came upon something he would end up spending years trying to forget, though finally, it gave him a chance to remember himself and his own history in a better way. 
Though it was still pretty messed up.
carved in the wall he found scratchings and markings. 
Illegible but obviously there at some point. 
It looked like a whole paragraph carved into the sand stone. 
He couldn't make it out, especially not in the moonlight, but in the bottom right corner where a signature would be was a blast hole in the sandstone, some stained spatter, and a crumpled pile of human bones, bleached and dried as if they had always been there. 
Jack reeled at the sight of the bones, and decided to get out of there before whatever killed that man got ahold of him. 
He turned and quickly wobbled back the way he came, stumbling a bit harder due to his newfound worry that a boogey man or cannibal native might be waiting around the next rock face, but as he turned the corner he had a thought and scampered back to the scene for one last thing.
The three of us were perched on the porch poaching nirvana from the passing evening, taking measures of long lounging silences and brief exchanges that occasionally escalated into full on conversations, generally ending in an effort to stop conflicting with the setting. 
During a lull, we all heard the crashing and stomping of Jack coming back to us thru the woods. 
We heard him long before he arrived, and were mildly entertained by his loudness and lack of grace, but I noticed Paps and Dolores were trying their best not to enjoy it, and so I also accepted the approaching sounds as a matter of neither humor nor consequence.
Finally out of the dark came a man much the same as Paps, a darker wilder beard, a rougher shabbier set of farm clothes, and a look in his eye like he just buried 3 living pirates with the ancient treasure. 
Pap stood up when he saw how aggravated Jack was.
"Jack! Now slow down. 
Get him some water Dolores. 
Calm down Jack. 
Sip this." Paps handed Jack a glass of ginger ale and bourbon which he sipped before launching into his news.
"I found a body!" He choked. 
Not fear per se, just windedness, I assumed.
"I thought you might." Said Dolores, almost disappointedly. 
Jack glanced at her askance.
"Up there on the Ridge! Looks to have been there at least a decade, maybe two." Paps' brow creased in interest. 
"looked like there was carvings on the rock, but the nights too dark, and I couldn't read it. 
Not sure the two are related."
"It's his goodbye note. 
See how he signed it with a gun and his bones are just beneath it?"
"Gaaad! Dolores! You been up there and seen that body?"
"Course I have Uncle Jack! I'm the only one small enough to wriggle thru the frenchbroom and manzanita, and I left it as such so as to give that poor body his privacy!" Dolores seemed almost bothered that Uncle Jack would dare impose upon this poor soul's chosen resting place. 
But she seemed to be treating it like a blind man who steps in the flowers. 
Paps' interest turned to concern as his attention shifted to the girl.
"Now Dolly, are you tellin me you been visiting a dead body?"
"A skeleton Paps. 
He's been there since before we have! I used to be able to read some of the words, but only the first few, because by the time he was getting to the end he had gotten tired of writing, and couldn't carve the letters as deep. 
It's his GRAVEstone! He just didn't get buried is all. 
And it's 'cause he wanted to die without people WAILing over him and forgetting his life by obsessing about his DEATH!" She seemed a bit flustered, as if she knew at some point her paternals would learn about her strange companion.
The living would never, she realized, be capable of leaving the dead alone, of appreciating a flower without picking it, of enjoying a story without prying into it by reading it or hearing it, or developing an opinion on it. 
Oh that the living would live in their lives and leave the rest of it to blend between decomposition and prestidigitation. 
And yet, even her motives and emotions were living, and thus flawed. 
Only perfection in death. 
Only the flighty hallucinations of heat waves and light fractures to keep us buoyant beings of physical essence incessantly present and assumed in our purpose.
Paps looked down and shook his head, spitting backwood tobacco from his bearded maw. 
"Now, you're a sensitive girl, and I suppose I may have done you a disservice raising you out here among the corpses and crickets." Dolores ran to him.
"Not a chance Paps. 
I understand and experience things like death in a way you and Jack, and probably Joe, just don't get. 
That body uncle Jack found is a man I named Laughing Peter. 
I named him Laughing because of the way his jawbone was laying,"
"Yeah, that spooked me out. 
LIke he was cackling at anyone walking by." Jack inserted.
"And Peter because he preformed his exit at the foot of a rock face. 
Peter means rock."
"Could you read his story?" Jack asked.
"No, it was long faded. 
I found that spot when I was about 9. 
It was when I was learning respect for the dead, and letting things lie, and similar lessons. 
So that became my real first lesson. 
Everyone else finds a body and immediately goes and finds their best friend to share the shock and trauma of first real experience of death. 
That's like losing your virginity to a hooker with a crowd watching! ... 
sorry Paps." Paps chortled in mild surprise.
"Now, don't be so soft daughter. 
I've heard such phrases, and I suppose I find them fitting. 
Death is a hugely misunderstood experience, and my desperate attempts to cling to the infinite shelfs of stored human souls, prying into their very livers of essence, picking away at their kidneys of experience, I feel like a voyeur sometimes when I pick through my library, and when I look across the field of gravestones, I am a packrat of humans. 
A keeper of souls. 
A stealer of essences. 
No, I respect what you did Dolores. 
letting the poor man lay where he put himself is the most respectful thing you can do, even if he chose a silly pose in a questionable station."
"Thanks dad." Dolores replied.
"I got his skull!" Uncle Jack said triumphantly. 
"I'm bringin it in for analysis to the museum, see what they can tell me."
"Jack! There's a shotgun blast thru the skull!! Why would you take that?!?!" Dolores looked a bit sick. 
Paps looked frustrated and about done with the scene.
"Yer SICK Jack." He said, and quickly ushered Dolores inside slamming the front door behind him. 
I hadn't said a word, and was suddenly left alone on the porch with this skull carrying lumberjack lookin bastard. 
Obviously an uncle and brother in this house, but apparently not a house trained one.
"Hi there Jack. 
My name is Joe. 
Nice skull ya got there." I stuck out my hand and shook his free one.
"Hey Joe. 
I guess they think of death differently. 
I'm a bit rougher than them two."
"'course! The world is dangerously short on exposure to literal occurrence in the form of primal immersion."
"I take it you been to college."
"accidentally. 
My enthusiasm to impress my parents turned into a drive to outdo them which turned into a disenchantment with money, ancestry, organized religion, population density, the malleability of language, and the impermanence of social sanity. 
Now I'm severely over that sequence of efforts, and am dedicated to not developing myself, because that seems to have cost me my interpersonal capacities."
"Yeah, you don't talk like people think. 
I did college, but I only wrote how I thought and wouldn't modify my wording or phrasing, so I ended up taking around 26 creative writing classes, but never getting any of my degrees or nothin. 
Fun little jaunt into a whole new thought box."
"Only creative writing? "
"Yup. 
didn't even do the formal english stuff, except what they required to get into creative writing. 
And than I just kept taking the same teachers semester after semester until I was told I had reached the maximum amount of repeats available, at which point I realized they weren't trying to help people learn what they wanted to get better at, but were instead tryin to get everyone to push emselves through the same filter, resulting in a very thin and watery human bean soup. 
I'm not so much into that idea."
"Me neither. 
I got thru, but feel like it was one big booby trap. 
I'm sure I benefited, but I would've benefited from anything I did, had I done it with proper attention and enthusiasm."
"Yeah, I got to know them intellectuals, and decided I'd rather be an anti-lectural. 
Nothin but spoutin one thought pattern down ten thousand throats to be relayed and replayed until we lay down in our little six foot dirt beds. 
Wanna hold the skull?"
"Yeah, I'll heft old laughing Peter for a moment. 
LOOK at THAT bLAST!" I held the skull up to the sky and gazed into the teeth and out the back, a shatter pattern orifice a fist might fit through, like looking out a sharks mouth, up into the sky full of diamonds. 
"I think I see the exit wound."
"Yup, I do believe you're right. 
Poor guy musta done something he wasn't proud of. 
Trippy job, ennit? crawlin up thru that manzanita, prolly on his belly most of the time. 
Too thick and impenetrable for deer or any big cats. 
Lookin for his own perfect site for eternity. 
Now what I REALLY want is to get some investigative photographers with the fancy cameras that document what happened long ago. 
Like it would find flecks of what he used to carve the stone, or maybe it'd be the fracture patterns that continued into the stone. 
I dunno."
"You really wanna dig this unburied guy up, dontcha?"
"I gotta know. 
He's a sad solitary sojourner, much like myself. 
understanding this poor bastards story might give me more control over my own."
"Well uncle Jack, I won't judge you for recognizing a like minded fracture in the skull of another. 
More power to ya!"
"Thanks Joe. 
I don't suffer the moral worries that others do. 
I'm only bothered that it makes Dolores sad. 
 Paps, I love pissin that old bastard off. 
We grew up together, and we might be brothers. 
I was raised by a single father in this town, and Paps was raised by a single mother over that ridge in the next town. 
We always used to run off into the woods and build universes and networks of spy paths and tree perches, patterning the passage of animals and humans along the intertownal woods pathery. 
We used to joke about how we was each stolen from the same family of wolves by different lonely grown ups. 
I had the angry solitude of primal man cut off from nurturing feminine essences, and Paps had the melancholy solitude of beatific essence at the whim of primal chaos."
"Nice. 
You quoting someone?"
"Yeah, I'm quoting myself."
"I dunno if that counts as quoting. 
Is it published?"
"Aaaah, fuck published. 
I got to know a few edges of that business, and decided I didn't like their logics, and wouldn't have the creative gumption were I to modify. 
I write a book and I put it in my security deposit box down at the train station."
"You serious? You have a security deposit box full of your old manuscripts?"
"I do. 
must be over 172 poems, 35 short stories, and 6 novellas, and 3 novels. 
Nothins finished, but nothin ever is, so I say fuck endings. 
Endings are unrealistic."
"That's absurd Jack. 
you just brought this skull back from a dramatic Shakespearean exit! How can you say that's not an ending?"
"Aint nothin ended! It started all THIS nonsense!" He placed the skull so that we could see the lake through it, shimmering with stars. 
"So he got finished with his vessel, and now I get to pick it up and go on an adventure of discovery exploring historical non-sequitors and spooky cultural traditions. 
That aint an end, that's a beginning. 
Now if I was this guy, and I was able to still be in the skull aware of what was going on, I'd be so friggin glad someone found me and decided to investigate and get my back story and bring me back to light!"
"back to light. 
interesting. 
Well this one is a bit morbid for me, but we all have our hobbies. 
Any guesses who it is?"
"Not a one. 
my first visit is to Stan Braxton, down at Jibbidy Pass. 
he's got an antique shop and local history museum. 
he knows the local lore. 
He'll have a dozen ideas."
"A dozen, huh? lotta disappearances around here?"
"nah. 
just a good empty rural valley with alota nooks and crannies no one'll check for another hundred years. 
Now how the shit did you wind up here? aint nothin but us deaduns fer miles around."
"Not counting the nature. 
I lost my pizzazz for humanity, and was hoping nature would make me miss the social flip and quiver, but ... 
wow, that sounded dirty. 
meh. 
 ature hasn't helped much. 
It stands as a demonstration of how we ought to behave, realistically, gently, integrative. 
Even its frictions are balletic demonstrations of the laws of the universe."
"Now aint that a fascination. 
Absence does NOT make the heart grow fonder, rather intimacy breeds contempt. 
You got a real prollem there boy. 
yaint gonna have much fun runnin that engine."
"I'm pokin around. 
looking for replacement parts. 
I'll fix this smokey old lemon of a brain of mine if I end up catatonic."
"Nothin wrong with catatonic. 
I think I'm about all done. 
I assume yer takin the couch. 
I'll sleep out here on the swing. 
Wont need blankets ner sheets. 
aint a moskitter in this valley. 
They say its the sage and lemonbalm et keeps em at bay, but I think its all them dead. 
The skeeters can tell there's many a bloodless body in this valley, and so they leave it be. 
after all, the closer to the city you get, the more naked flesh to insert yer proboscis and pump out a sip of blood from."
"Good lord Jack. 
yer gonna give me the most wonderful dreams I never could've asked for a better bed time story."
"Bah! The worse the dream the better waking up feels. 
You ever have the best dream of your life? The next day is like eating sand. 
Dream badly live well. 
Dreams are thoughts that build up in the night to take over and interfere with your day. 
Waking up with images of long dead folk telling me advice on what I did wrong yesterday aint gonna make tomorrow any better."
"You ever try listening to them? They sometimes say some interesting things. 
After all, the dream is your brain trying to communicate with your body. 
Or with itself. 
I dunno. 
Gnite Jack. 
don't dream too hard."
"I'll try not."
CHAPTER FOUR :: MIGRATORY BONES
The next morning my marooned peace of leather couch consolation was shattered by Uncle Jack bowling into the house hollering. 
Paps was already in the kitchen making coffee, polite enough to leave me sleeping, but Jack just didn't have it in him to leave the resting resting. 
Arresting his enthusiasm, he hooted out, "My skull is gone!"
"Damn right it is Jack! Bargin in hollerin waking up the guest. 
You musta left yer skull on the ridge last nite when you picked up that other one."
"Nah! That's the one that's MISSING!!"  He insisted, grabbing Paps elbow, almost shaking the coffee pot from his grip.
"Well it weren't your skull to start with! Dolores probably took it to put it back. 
You old graverobbin bastard. 
I don't blame her neither. 
You actin like you had some right to the skull. 
Yer about to get the curse of old Leroy Jameson put on yer god fersakin soul. 
I pity these exuberant soul fuckers. 
draggin each others stories out across the map like entrails. 
AH! OUT of my kitchen! GO Bother your dead!! Leave the living in peace!!" Jack let go of Paps' elbow and stomped to the door.
"I'm gettin my skull back! Aint no reason she has a right to it! It's part of nature now. 
Like taking home a rock. 
She aint all bugaboo about that kinda stuff. 
Why are human rocks any different?"
"SHADDUP!" Paps hollered at the slamming door. 
"Sorry Joe. 
Jack's got a funny notion about how life works."
"Don't we all." I countered, rubbing eye boogers into my septum. 
The result was the usual, blurred morning vision fuzz. 
Almost like an intermediary blanket between me and reality. 
Hypnogaugic immersion of the optic expurgation... 
blech. 
Bad case of early morning shit brain. 
musta been my wonderful dreams. 
I stood unsteadily and made my way headily into the kitchen to sit and breathe a bit before trying to piece together either the dream I just had or the present and the people involved in the literal occurrence. 
Bah! thoughts are bi-products. 
They occur after experience. 
Like shit happens after food. 
Bi-product. 
Leftover. 
Thoughts are what's left over after something happens. 
Gah! Fight Back The Thoughts!! ENGAGE HUMANITY!!!
"Nice table ya got here, Paps. 
Thick. 
one big ass chunk of wood."
"Yup. 
I made that myself. 
No hardware neither. 
All wood pegs and tongue in groove. 
Found it down by the lake one day. 
It looked like some kinda ancient remnant of a Paleozoic ... 
Uh... 
Primordial forest. 
Or some such thing."
"Still does. 
The dark stain makes it look like it was pulled out of the labrea tar pits."
"Ah, you don't even know where those are."
"Yeah I do! Labrea!"
We chatted and chortled and allowed the coffee to allow us to chatter, and we laughed at little things like a bug not crossing a crack in the deck. 
After a couple hours of lighter topics, we moved into literature, and finally we spoke of Jack, but Paps couldn't compare his brother to any of the fools on his shelves. 
Though he agreed they were fools, all of them and forever, but he felt his brother had a sort of graceless caveman lurch about himself, while the true greats could make a sentence hum and shimmer, culminating in the most perfectly placed period  .
And in the third hour of our exchange, Jack came a tumble grumble stumbling out of the underbrush down from the ridge. 
"NOTHIN!" He hollered approaching. 
"Even his BONES are gone now!!" Paps' expression changed to one of intense worry. 
Had she lost her nuts? I mean,lost her mind and gone nuts? She musta found her nuts to steal a fuckin skeleton!
"Come on Paps. 
She's got a good heart. 
She aint bein a weirdo." I said, hoping he wasn't worried about her mind.
"I know she's a good girl. 
I'm just worried about how the world might treat a 22 year old beauty with a backpack full of bones." He shuddered, as did we. 
"Jack! You better get after her. 
I have no idea where she is, but you better come up with some ideas!" He stormed into the house and slammed the door, and once more I was left with an agitated Uncle Jack on Paps' porch.
"Well Gaddamn, my thievin niece is about to drag me into some hellish nonsense. 
Laughin Jack and the Ballad of Gumshoe Girl in, The Mystery of the Stolen Bones. 
I feel like Nancy Drew."
"Well, yer a far sight from her tolerable countenance. 
Remember, think like a weird girl who steals peoples bones to protect them from scientists."
"Ah! Don't Pander to me. 
I aint no scientist. 
Just another cursed soul looking for a recognizable echo in human history. 
Tell Paps I'll find her. 
I fetched her back from runnin away when she was 12, I spose I can do it now that she's twenty two. 
Though I spose I'll have to modify my techniques."
"Yeah, be... 
diplomatic. 
maybe tell her you want to bring your expert to the rock, and you'll leave the bones there, so he remains relatively undisturbed." Jack paused and scratched his chin.
"It's worth a try. 
She aint crazy. 
Just fixed in her nonsense."
Doll had risen early, before the sun even began to taint the satin sky with its luster, and crept out to the porch, snatching up Uncle Jack's knapsack with the skull in it, and making off towards the ridge to gather the rest of the bones and return them to a place more peaceful, and perhaps closer to where the soul had come from. 
She felt only mild distaste as to the nature of her quest, but it bothered her little, knowing that her revulsion was purely physical, while her obligation was one purely spiritual.
The path Uncle Jack had left was wide enough for a mule, though only tall enough for a hunchback chimpanzee, the upper branches reaching and lurching down across above like pick up sticks in space, creating a constantly randomizing pattern of the creeping blue light of morning to be cast like a broken stain glass window of infinite lines across the mulchy soft floor of the dwarf forest. 
Dolores didn't mind the dirt, and she didn't mind the skull that she carried softly like a egg as big as a football in the crook of her arm. 
Soon she reached the ridge and made light work of prancing across the aggressive rockface with its infinite shale shatter mini-ridges reaching up to break of and stumble the steady hiker. 
She glided across it like a paper umbrella poking ice cubes.
And upon reaching the sanctum of this poor souls final resting place, she paused, and gazed at the markings that once were words, above the blast that seemed to act as a signature, that stood above the crumpled pile of this skull's old bones. 
She almost seemed to be silently asking permission from the ancient inscription, and after a brief moment she went to work filling the knapsack with the sun bleached bones of yet another forgotten existence left to expire like the last tray of hors dvours at a weight watchers convention. 
She paused at her work, holding a fibea halfway in the bag. 
Weight watchers convention? This isn't a thought she would usually have. 
Must be reading too much Wodehouse and Wilde.
She finished packing the bones without another odd thought, stood up, and gazed at the faded inscription. 
What clue might it have for a post mortem investigator? Something. 
Something. 
The shape of each letter, the slant of the line, the length of stroke... 
where would he be from to write like that? tall letters, sharp corners, twisty frilly stoke dissipations... 
he must have edited and accentuated it before offing himself. 
I wonder if my guess about his name is right.
Laughing Peter petered out,
His echo died indifferently.
And on we shimmer, we the grout.
The rocks we hold fall into time.
I should write that down. 
maybe carve it in as an antecedent, or whatever they're called.
CHAPTER FIVE :: DAN BAR  & FRANK
Dolores noticed a man at the far end of the bar. 
He was mumbling a mumble that slowly escalated, and he seemed unaware that it was vocal. 
It sounded like a train of thought, and nothing near a soliloquy and definitely not poetry. 
"Mutha fuckin camera angle always keeps it unclear. 
Who knows where she's working, and if they're dating and if it was a hug or a kiss? And will it ever pan out? And who could have known? And here we are staring at the stupid child inside, realizing that its a simple silly way to avoid. 
avoidance a vow to never dance. 
the void and we the ants. 
Tis naught but onslaught tenacious and tacky. 
Will I be this indefinitely? Is there now respite from these things? And when the words stop gushing and dumping, will something keep me buoyant? Is thought only words? Is flight build from laws and explanations? Or is potential directly and indefatigably tied to belief? Are we bound to submit to our own assumptions on and on indefinitely? We switch, we swirl, we watch and we wish and we want for a person who might recognize what we are and how we might fly off into the night as mere blips of... 
 Aw shit. 
Was I doing it again Dan?"
"Yeah, don't worry about it Frank. 
That shit kinda cracks me up. 
You don't mind that I let you keep goin, do ya?"
"Yeeeah, just stop me if it gets weird." Frank replied, and looked down the bar towards Dolores. 
"I hope you weren't eavesdropping on my medical condition. 
" Dolores looked over grinning.
"Is that what that is? I never knew it had become ushered into the American Medical Association's Big Black Dictionary." Dolores blushed. 
She hadn't meant to make the last joke. 
It was a Laughing Peter, and she wished she had something besides his bones to chastise. 
Even that thought suddenly became invaded by a Laughing Peter Ism. 
Chaste Eyes My Bones. 
Which narrator did she prefer? Crickets. 
"Is there a name for your condition, or is it just your name?"
"It's called Frank Indecency. 
No, My name is Frank, and it's called a narration leak. 
I picked up the wrong drink at a party, and now I can't tell if I'm thinking or talking. 
It's kind of like being incontinent, except with words. 
'scuse the comparison."
"Not at all. 
It's quite fitting. 
So do words just fall apart in your brain? I noticed what you were doing with the word avoidance. 
a vow to dance, the void, we ants." She sipped at her girly drink. 
"Is that a hobby of yours, or a sort of neurolinguistic twitch?"
"Well, you got the words. 
Good on ya! I'd say it's both. 
Kind of a neural twitch I developed into a useful tool."
"I don't see how that could ever be useful."
"You read books?"
"Yeah."
"You ever meet a writer?"
"Hrm.. 
Not specifically. 
Not that could qualify as actual."
"What do you think they do?"
"I spose they dismantle words and sounds and thoughts and recombine them into unexpected revelations and resolutions and..."
"And blah blah blah. 
Sounds like you write too." Dolores smiled at his assumption.
"I suppose I could. 
I never tried. 
It ... 
The field seems swamped with people who have already proven beyond a shadow that there is no other approach and all avenues have been plumbed to their depths. 
There seems to be very few remaining expeditions to be pursued." Franks eyes became dark and illusive. 
The reductive element had once more reared its ugly head, and this time, in the guise of a clever attractive girl. 
Why is the world haunted by this infinite shrinking, this perpetual retreat? Where have all the merry makers gone? this dreary lack of gumption sucks the life from me. 
Oh the mournful gloaming of human expression, when did we stray so far from our Godness?
"Was I talking?"
"No."
"Good. 
It probably would have been rude. 
I'm very bothered by smart people who don't write, and madam, you have just now deposited yourself proudly into that paradigm. 
Has your brain ever existed? Will it ever again? Is it a constantly changing wash of unguessable nextness? How is it that one such as you with the gift of effervescence might shrink from the light of exposure? The world is choked with dead authors and dry moderns. 
We cannot sustain on this diet of bones. 
Call back, fall back, into visceral immediacy. 
There is no other, there is no you. 
Words are water, our brains are creek beds, and to neglect the perfection simply because we've seen something similar before, this is to shun our self regenerating potential to be perpetual."
"You really feel about this, don't you?"
"Absolutely! Ever since we stopped literally keeping ourselves alive, our brains have become the biggest threat to a shortened life span. 
Is this how its meant to be? Is this what is required? Will the shadow of death forEVER reign, blanking out the glow of existence? And besides... 
who are you?"
"My name is Dolores. 
I'm traveling."
"Well that's nice and vague. 
Where from where to both irrelevant. 
ever been here?"
"Nope. 
Flatsborough is new to me. 
Seems to be a tolerable taint of a town." Dolores twitched.
"Taint much," Frank replied, "but it's ours for now. 
And hours from now, it might be nothing more than a memory. 
See, I'm traveling too." Dan the bartender returned to replace Frank's drink with a fresh one.
"He is not. 
He's on a circuit." Inserted Dan, wiping his wet hands on his jolly belly and wrinkling his nose to fight off an itch. 
"He writes local news for ... 
what is it now Frank, 12 towns??" Frank took a sip and shook his head.
"Go right ahead, Dan. 
put me right out there on blast. 
I'm not ashamed. 
I pretend to be from places in order to get hired. 
I find my own work offensive to me. 
It reminds me that people don't want the literal realistic gory details, they want a cookie cutter palatable presentation of a world they want to live in, not one in which they are literally occupied. 
When we decide our hopes for life are more important than reality, this is them moment when we put ourselves at the greatest risk of losing connection to truth, and thus becoming nauseated with life. 
We have taught ourselves to haunt ourselves. 
And so I haunt these dozen towns scattered amidst these valleys and ridges. 
I haunt them with their own falsified assumptions. 
I haunt them with superficial shiny grinning interviews with local business owners who also happen to be part of the anti-homeless league and the banish non Christians coalition, but these sacred secret old boy clubs of keeping life how it ought to have been if our ancestors weren't lying to us and themselves... 
Aw shit."
"Don't worry bout it Frank. 
I hear ya. 
So why aren't you writing a novel?"
"'cause I'm full of shit."
"So call the book shit." Dolores offered. 
Not a suggestion she would usually make. 
This skull seems to be interrupting my usual narrator. 
And rearranging my assumptions about prior interpretations. 
Or maybe it's this guy. 
He seems ... 
Haunted by his own ideals.
"Shit. 
That does have a nice ring to it. 
Maybe I will. 
I just don't want it to be pure vomit. 
Since my actual job is such trite shimmery falsities, it would cause this project to be a ruthless assault on all that we hold dear. 
By which I mean it would be unreadable."
"Some of the best books in history have been unreadable! That's no excuse. 
You begin by lecturing me for neglecting my own narrative flow, and yet you stand, cursed with the self same avoidance. 
Except even worse, you've auctioned off your expression like a cheap whore in hopes of a fancy new piece to catch the eye of a panting new jon. 
I don't really mean that. 
writing is writing. 
words are words. 
They aren't ever true, never will they hold anything except a vein for the electricity of human attention to flicker across. 
I met a man once by the name of Hurricane. 
He helped me throttle my narrator, or at least ignore its incessant insistence. 
Would you like to hear about Hurricane? It sounds like his inputs might be quite applicable to your situation."
"Please! Tell me the story of Hurricane!"
CHAPTER SIX ::: HURRICANE
"What do you do when you stop liking yourself?" Dolores asked the old man with the beard the wrinkles and the bottle.
"You be someone else." He replied without pausing. 
Dolores looked at him like he was a priest ending services.
"And how does one do such a thing?" She queried.
"Kill yer narrator." He replied, never once having taken his gaze from the cackling fire. 
She moved this around in her mind like a solitary chess piece in the wake of a very one sided game. 
This all made perfect sense to her, and within seconds she had found ways of applying it, already telling herself to shut up and listen, even to the silence. 
She felt her silence becoming foreign, no longer inhabited by fancies and faeries, but cursed with lurking burgeounings. 
Old Hurricane Face had stolen her attention with his gnarled archaic woodgrain face and philosophy. 
The swirling silence of tree stance became a totem of sanity that she pulled into her own sub-expression. 
As if her very bones were changing in accordance with her new head space.
"When you kill the narrator, does another one show up?"
"Everytime." He replied, "And its almost a duplicate. 
It takes ten thousand deaths for the narrator to actually become a different person. 
Until than, it's only changing one word at a time. 
One choice at a time. 
One thought at a time. 
Damned narrators are infinite. 
Once your own thoughts stop, all these quotes and song lyrics start pouring in. 
You know, some people think in crickets?"
"Like, instead of ... 
shut up." Dolores tried to fill her thought box with nothing but crickets but found it near impossible. 
A soft base layer of chirping in her head began, but quickly became peppered with her thinking the word "crickets. 
crickets. 
crickets..." which was soon joined by an onslaught of every cricket she'd ever experienced. 
Images of their violin bow legs grinding against each other, cartoons of crickets, cricket characters from fables she had grown up with, and than it fell apart when she stopped to wonder what the difference is between a cricket and a grasshopper.
"The narrator does seem resilient. 
I can't hold only cricket sounds in my brain. 
It quickly becomes awash in a network of related experiences." She stared into the fire. 
She didn't realize how rare it was for people to stare into fires. 
She didn't realize that she was reliving ancient memories of fire worship. 
It became a flickering reverse waterfall dissipating into the shades.
"Be more like the smoke and less like the fire." Hurricane replied. 
"And while you're at it, explain to me why you decided to join me on my jaunt? Just lookin for company?"
"I'm looking for a new narrator. 
Mine is quickly becoming someone else's, and it's causing problems." Dolores paused. 
Quickly becoming someone else's? She shuddered slightly at what she herself was suggesting.
"You steal something?" Dolores jumped, as did her reply.
"YES!" she said, before he'd even finished the question. 
 "I've never stolen! I didn't mean to! I thought I was giving it back to someone, but there's no one to give it back to."
"Sounds to me like it's up for grabs."
"No. 
Its very much not up for grabs, and its very much not mine. 
How did you know I had stolen something?"
"Well, you been tellin stories about yerself in everything you do. 
The way you hold that satchel, it's probably got yer bounty in there, whatever it is. 
The fact that you seem harmless yet unworried by the prospect of being robbed, it must not be worth actual money. 
Must be an emotional totem. 
This is the main clue. 
You're giving in to your totem, letting it steer more than yourself. 
That might be why you've got a conflicted narrator right now, because you've got two channels coming in. 
Mind if I ask what it is you stole?" He finally raised his eyes from the fire and rested them on her. 
She shrank a bit, than reversed it, puffing out slightly.
"I don't think its proper at this time for me to give away too much. 
As you said, it's up for grabs, but it still may be... 
Illegal to own. 
Or carry." Hurricane grinned a grin of muddy triumph. 
The 12 year old grin of an 80 year old man who finally feels fifty again.
"Relax." He said.
"Relics?" She asked, not sure what he had said.
"I WAS RIGHT!!" He hooted. 
"You got yerself some ancient bones, doncha. 
maybe a skull?" The topic had ignited hurricane's ramble muscle, and he was about to perspectify Dolores. 
 "I knew a man who got sprayed by a skunk and went blind for 3 days. 
While he was blind he found a rock, and decided it was an alien skull. 
This rock kept him company through his blindness, sending him comforting thoughts and being little spoon to his big spoon, and when his blindness had been healed, which he attributed to the rock, he started touring with the rock, introducing it to what few business owners and park lurkers would lean an ear towards him as he wandered from town to town, never quite finding his actual audience, which I believe is in Sedona Arizona. 
So you see, its impossible to tell whether this rock was an alien skull or a rock, and whether or not our dear friend was insane. 
After all, a totem is a totem. 
If we teach our brains to only work when we are in the presence of incense, if we only teach or brains to work in the evening over dinner, than that is the only time it will become active. 
If only our brains were trained into perpetual competence, never flinching beneath flecks of unexpected input, the spit of thought falling through sound. 
Relics. 
Congratulations my dear, you are far older than your age, and I congratulate. 
Oh, I said that . 
You, madame, have approached the one aspect of life that our poor species has made itself incapable of processing. 
And you have embraced it and welcomed it into your sphere. 
I still keep what seems to be a finger bone." He pulled a length of nubbin from his pocket, felt it between his fingers without looking at it. 
"I went off to die. 
I layed there at the foot of a redwood tree for three days. 
I rolled around a bit. 
Went on a walk the second day, just around the tree. 
 I mean, literally. 
I got up, and walked around the tree, and sat back down. 
I was ready to die. 
I'd run out of ideas, run out of gumption, run out of places and ways to run. 
And so I went off to be done and let that final sun come down. 
Day three, the animals were ignoring me. 
Skunks and raccoons and squirrels, deer and birds and such. 
I met these animals as if I were meeting my 5 year old self. 
Joy and delirious wonder. 
Recognition of someone and something I've seen every day for decades and had never remembered to notice. 
Each animal's facial expression gave me different advice. 
The deer told me to worry and live. 
The squirrels told me to rattle and thrive. 
The birds told me to take only what I need and stay weightless. 
The raccoons told me tend your own defend your own and even pretend to own. 
And the skunk told me that stink is strength. 
Meeting the animals was profound, but not enough. 
It felt as though I had been sent a death bed to be envied by the gods. 
And I reveled in it. 
My dreams on the third night were those of a Roman God, visiting the life I was wishing to leave, and catastrophizing it, reveling in the disintegration of an essence I had only let accumulate and never intentionally chosen."
Hurricane passed her the whiskey, and continued to ramble. 
Dolores nodded off for a moment, and snapped back out of it, feeling extremely guilty for having almost fallen asleep to a story about attempted suicide. 
She looked up at him intently, trying to keep from drifting, but the whiskey was a new kick for her. 
Sangria had been what her paternals sipped, and she was only ever allocated a glass per night, which brings a similar shimmer with less of an eyelid anchor. 
This whiskey wasn't quite sippable, but just the experience of trying to get the blasted stuff into your guts was a worthy task. 
She coughed, and gave a giggle. 
Her thoughts were not her own, and she was ready to own it. 
The whiskey seemed to have loosened her cranial retention, allowing Hurricane's pace and cadence to modify her own patterns. 
But behind that she felt something else. 
She felt the skull in her satchel, she felt the jaw bone through the canvas, and she thought of the man with the alien skull. 
If this man had only needed a new narrator, than it wouldn't matter if he picked up a rock or a skull or a handful of dirt. 
If that is where he wants his new narrator to emanate from, his mind will allow it. 
His mind will enable it. 
What was hers? Had she taken the skull because she wanted change? Or had the skull showed up because it was her time? Or was the skull invading her own, supplanting her system of experience that she'd spent 22 years in pastoral isolation developing and modifying and perfecting. 
She longed for crickets. 
She stilled her thoughts, and realized Hurricane was still talking.
"The morning of the fourth day I awoke weak and blurry. 
Dehydrated and achey, cold and raw. 
But the exuberance I felt is something that remains unmatched in my own experience. 
life is only in sharp relief when pitted against death. 
The further from death we get, the further from life we get. 
So the morning of the fourth day, I tried to walk around the tree again, and fell twice. 
my second fall I felt under my palm something neither wood nor stone. 
Maybe the bruise on my shin sent adrenaline and norepenephrine in perfect doses to cause what you might call a vision quest moment thing, because once it hit my palm, it stayed in my palm. 
It came up before my eyes, ushered there by my shaking fingers, and ... 
No way to really explain this. 
It meant something. 
It didn't speak, it didn't glow, it just... 
Exuded meaning."
He passed the finger bone over to her, and she agreed, it didn't glow, but it did exude. 
It seemed to be more real than anything around it, almost as if it were a projector for this three dimensional hallucination called reality. 
She stroked it against her left cheek, and felt its warmth. 
She smelled it, and it had Hurricane's unique stench of rollies whiskey and shitty firewood. 
She knew she had found a good travel companion, and would be sad when he got to where he was going. 
Handing back the relic, Dolores almost immediately nodded off, puddling the canvas up beneath her head. 
Yes, she was using the satchel of bones as a pillow.
CHAPTER SEVEN :: TALL RANTS
Uncle Jack came back, and he is an agry reckless bastard, let me tell you. 
He had cuts and bruises all up and down his arms as if he'd been in dubious battle with a landslide. 
He coughed and spit burgundy sangria phlegm before putting his hands to his face and pushing his hair back. 
His locks hung like creeper vines across his wrinkled forehead. 
He was not young any more, and was obviously doing his best to avoid admitting it. 
His stomach was a pulsating bulb of acid reflux. 
He rattled inside like a train with square wheels, and the sky would not cease churning. 
He hesitated to admit his own craving for oblivion. 
People don't crave such things. 
specially not ones such as Jack. 
He'd never been a quitter, and he'd always found most life in the wilderness. 
But something had pulled him from his sane safety realm of isolation, and there was no clear solve to be applied. 
Solvent salvation was not in the works for that poor bastard.
"Paps. 
Are we brothers?" Jack looked across the fire at the man he'd known for half a century.
"We're more than brothers Jack. 
We're chosen family. 
That's why I tolerate you." Paps replied, ashing his backwood and slouching a little deeper into his little personal pit snuggled up against a massive pine log.
"Ah! You don't tolerate me. 
I been kicked out of here more times than I've been allowed to stay." Jack said, stabbing his thumb towards the house.
"And still you return. 
If that aint tolerance I dunno what is." Jack smiled and took a slug.
"Shit paps, you might end up burying me soon. 
I'm just about out of seasons and reasons to stay on this monkey ride."
"Will you quit yer thinking?! If you didn't think you wouldn't have that thought, and than you might live a little better, a little longer, a little funner."
"You can't just stop your thoughts! It doesn't work like that! They continue! Even if I don't look at the words floating through my brain, they're still there, floating on past!"
"And they will continue to be there, floating on past. 
But if you leave your brain in gear than you will constantly be hitting the brakes. 
Thus, if your mindset is ever at risk of descent, being in gear is the LAST thing you want. 
Especially if you have a creeping idle. 
Let em float past! yer grabbin at nothing, and it's pulling you down."
"Is this all we've ever done? Me telling you why I feel crazy, you telling me how to dodge the brain bombs... 
I feel like I been doing this forever."
"You only remember your weak points Jack. 
Very human of you. 
Very decent. 
You forget that you saved my life. 
You were there when Sally died giving birth to Dolores. 
You pulled me back out of my despondence. 
You rallied me from my doldrums. 
You tackled me and wrenched the gun from my hands when all I craved was a sweet sip of lead to end the shit storm in my head." Paps paused, and choked up for a moment. 
"I'm alive Jack. 
YOU did that. 
Dolores would've been raised by foster parents in a strange town, probably a city. 
But you saved her by saving me, Jack. 
Don't neglect yourself Jack, you deserve much much more than that." Jack let out a raucous cackle.
"Well THATS the last thing I expected out of YOU! I almost expected you to hand me a bus ticket and tell me to heal elsewhere."
"Bah, yer not that drunk Jack. 
Though that left eye of yours does seem to be looking for something behind your ear." They lapsed into silence and smiled with pleasance. 
The crickets rose in chorus and spun through their skulls, the song of the silken darkness enveloping the chosen brothers. 
This silence seemed to stretch on across three such evenings, though it only lasted less than thirty seconds. 
This ends up being about as long as it takes to read a 5 sentence paragraph.
"And the boy? I don't see Joe. 
You send him on his way? Realize that burying is a one man job?"
"He's still out searching for Dolores. 
He's getting to know the area. 
He goes to about one town a week. 
Says he's got a circuit. 
Each town he goes to the library, the cemetery, the park, and the pub. 
He's been to six so far. 
Got six more to go. 
Seems to be enjoying it."
"Is he walkin the ridges?"
"Sometimes. 
On the far ones he takes a bus. 
He actually pulled a couple pieces of info from some of his bus rides. 
There's a man by the name of Frank, who's got a circuit. 
Apparently that's where Joe learned it. 
YOu know Frank? He writes for ... 
just about every paper in the county."
"Frank ... 
Stern is it? "
"Might be. 
That might be one of his fake names though. 
He started out pretending to be from every town in the county, but this obviously didn't work very well, 'cause everyone knows everyone here. 
So he continually retold his origin story making it vaguer and filled with more mystique until he himself couldn't clarify it beyond saying he was raised by a relative who died when he was nine, and he immediately became a transient ..."
CHAPTER EIGHT : NO RATER
"Why is every character I come up with a self hating transient who can't keep their train of thought on the same topic? How did this loop shrink to such unfitting proportions of resistance to shit box billowing pain fish guilt on why never made good why never finish how language fall apart when it come back we find good. 
Not now. 
Not me. 
Not this. 
Something else someday. 
All we do is encourage what is in those around us and discourage what isn't. 
How easy is that? How fucking hard can it really be just to simply say something true and find out a good way to add to the world and make it a better place? How did it become this convoluted fuckery of infinite variable sand unguessable platforms to speak from and qax on and masturbate your soul away with your pontificatory ejaculations. 
My god I disgust myself. 
This is a show of pompous thought slaughter, and aloft I stand holding the jade knife in one hand, and my still pumping heart in the other, and aloft I lift it, screaming a mohikan cackle whoop that ought to shake the very foundations of this mountain that maintains itself as the station from whence I lift my kunta kintay baby brain heart and shatter the night sky with my glorious divine expectations of recognition and occurrence and when nothing happens and I simply slump down against a rock blood trickling down my wrists, rain spitting across my face, mid clasping my under thing like the mighty softness of a woman's hand, and back we are again to the fucking subconscious craving throwing in an extra demand to make the metaphor about sex. 
Is it because that girl was walking by right Nathan? Is it because I'm cursed with a sort of excessively sensitive essence that gets pulled along after every flashing pair of infinite eyes?  I haven't written about women in so long. 
Only death . 
Only madness. 
Only taxes. 
What shitty realms to align my self with to marginalize myself to . 
to extramorbidly fornicate with thoughts that could be better used as filler in a shit brain fix fuck stick shift into a different gear and dont let the sounds escape as the narrator takes on its non onslaught of incomparable ramblings towards some unguessable evacuation that can't help but be exactly what we were hoping to find at the end of all this."
Frank slumped back against his chair. 
It hurts to write, he thought to himself. 
It hurts like picking a scab or treating a burn or that bubbly shit they pour on cuts. 
Writing hurts, like cotton swaps in a flesh wound. 
Like fucking tree bark stuck in your teeth. 
Writing is not meant to be enjoyed, though reading might be. 
Writing is writing is writing is the perpetual suicide of the incompetent narrator. 
The perpetual failing flailure of mortal play. 
why do we crave these things? Why does a healthy hangover seem to be the best tonic for perpetuating this state? Will this road lead to madness? In one hear out the other, feel the heat rising within, hear the rumbling of anothers chosen brother choosing to remind their immediacy of infinity and the unguessableness of all that will end up at some other time.
Dolores was already reading it, and Frank was struggling to control his head space, and keep it from sneaking off into another freestyle ramble. 
Exhausting. 
Truly taxing. 
They had drank and rambled with Dan til the bar closed, and upon hearing that she was camping, he had invited her to stay on his couch. 
Dan had assured her that Frank wasn't a rapist, and Dolores had felt safe and comfortable around him, so she had gone home with him. 
Not in the hollywood sense, but their exchanges were softening and becoming more childish and playful. 
It was 5 in the morning, and they had been taking turns trying to write something that had never been written before. 
This began as a series of haikus, each of which Frank would have to google to make sure, and it became a desperate pursuit of the unexpected. 
This was Franks latest attempt to break through the glass floor into his subconscious. 
It was something he did every once in awhile, but it was always scary, and it always hurt. 
He had been extremely hesitant to try stream of conscious writing with a girl he just met, feeling sure he might accidentally spout out some unforgivable shit, but she had been trading with precisely similar levels of callous colorful language. 
She finished his latest piece, and offered her response.
"I'm not sure what its trying to say. 
You don't seem consistent in your goal."
"I think it's gonna get scrapped. 
I gotta pick through it and identify the dozen narrators that are always jumping in and interrupting each other."
"That sounds a bit ... 
aggravating."
"You have no idea. 
I may end up handing each outpouring to a different character. 
It becomes fairly approachable when I can identify who I first heard a phrase from, and what experience made me decide it was the rule and not the exception."
"The main point seems to be there is no rule, only exceptions."
"That's an interesting rule. 
It's a good way to go mad as well." Frank replied.
"So is your writing style." Dolores replied, handing the sheet back to him.
"That's not style. 
That's the aggressive attempt to violently do away with all that is style, and get back to literal occurrence. 
words show up iny our brain, and they somehow reference what's going on around you." Frank popped a purple grape into his mouth and met Dolores in the eyes. 
"Its an attempt. 
Style comes long after the attempt. 
Much the same as jewelry. 
You don't mine gold rings, you mine ore. 
Than you assault the ore with everything at your disposal." Frank sipped blush from the bottle. 
"At this point we've already gone through two very distinct jobs and personalities. 
The miner, and the alchemist. 
Next comes the artisans, and finally the salesmen. 
People get good at their job by recognizing their personal predilection. 
This personal predilection may simply be what narratorial experience occurs most naturally for you. 
Thus, a shitty writer is very good at sounding like themself. 
A good writer is good at sounding like anyone." He finished, placing a cheese laden cracker on his tongue and smoonching it all in one bite.
"Well, this writing doesn't sound like a person. 
It sounds like a radio station that's picking up too many channels and hates the fact that its a radio station." Frank sat up and grinned.
"Isn't there a Roger Waters album about that?"
"No, I think that's about a robot who wants to be a radio. 
"
CHAPTER NINE ::  NARRATORIAL BREAKDOWN
I wasn't really looking for Dolores. 
She was old enough to disappear for her own reasons, and I was relaxed enough, for the first time in my life, to just be where I was, and let that continually be what it is. 
It's hard to write a story about something that didn't happen. 
Or, no. 
'cause that's called fiction. 
It's hard to write a story about ... 
when nothing happened. 
And how powerful and profound it was.
The death of the narrator is a joyous occasion. 
The birth of the action is also a pretty neat thing, but that seems to be beyond me at this point. 
One crux seems to be my problem with telling the truth, or at least wanting to. 
This makes all stories false in that their emphasis is overly specific, and the story ends when the focus is resolved. 
This is not reality, this is not truth. 
This only serves to teach people to shrink further into their own heads, expecting something out there to fix what ever seems to be misfiring in here.
All these fictional characters have arrived at a new point, become new people even. 
They have accomplished the goal of starting one way and ending another. 
This leaves me, the author, in a bind. 
If I were to prompt some unprecedented change in the lucks of these characters, I'd be forcing it. 
These characters occurred in my subconscious because they each carry a conundrum that I've been toying with as of late.
I told Paps I was looking for Dolores, Just because, well, I can stop by several spots every time I get anywhere. 
That's not a problem. 
So I guess in a passive way I was in search, but it was not at all what was compelling me. 
I'm really lookin for myself. 
All stupid and cliche like. 
But someone once said, nature, pure deep naked wilderness, will bring out a mans peculiarities. 
And it seems to be bringing out some series of inner monologues I didn't quite realize were there. 
Maybe that's why my road trip was spent at high speeds with the music blasting.
---------------------------------------------
"They always come back. 
as long as they're not dead. 
" Jerry ashed his grit and sipped his brew. 
I gave him a lackluster grin of indifferent acceptance. 
He can't just claim they always come back. 
It's simply not true! I know dozens of people personally who have never gone back, nor will they. 
maybe he's talking about something other than physical presence. 
The memory will always come back.
"She'll be fine man. 
Not a question of if, its a question of when. 
'course she aint fine right now, but that's cause she's aggressively pursuing the one lesson she couldn't learn at her graveyard home from her body buryin paps." He glanced around the dim shabby pub as if in search of an example. 
"There! See that woman over there? I wouldn't call her nice. 
I wouldn't call her mean. 
I also wouldn't call her back. 
She aint left yet. 
Sure, she left her parents home, her ancestral religion, her origins and educations, but she forgot to leave herself. 
She managed to forget everything except the subconscious path these triggers created in her. 
Thus, she remains, neither nice nor mean, neither right nor wrong, neither more nor less than she's ever been." With this, he lifted his glass, and emptied it into his entrails. 
I was mildly annoyed with his lack of input. 
Where had my question gone, and how had he dragged me into this irrelevancy?
I stood quickly up, drained my glass, and left whiskey stained Jerry at the bar, looking around at his collection of never do nothiners. 
He seemed a toy in a toyshop, not bothered, not stifled, simply aware that this was far from all. 
And off I went into the rest of it, to find what I might.
.......................................
Sonya knew everything that needed to be known. 
She understood things beyond language. 
Grady had nothing on her. 
She owned the entire ranch and everyone on it. 
Not legally, much deeper and more permanent than that. 
She had Grady's depth and Peter's charm, but neither of their dysfunctional tics. 
She was endearing to all she met, paying extra attention to people due to the language gap, and she had no motive nor agenda. 
Hers was the beautific role of appreciating that which blossoms around you.
This was not her only role. 
She entered the cheese farm getting a job as a Churn Maid, a fetish term that Laughing Peter got endless amusement using. 
Grady never laughed at this joke, but you could always catch the edge of his mouth twitch with a soft smile. 
He ended up getting this same twitch every time Sonya entered the room. 
Sonya immediately noticed, and would use it as a gauge of how entertained he was with whatever was going on. 
Only Laughing Peter could prompt the coughing belly laugh that made Grady's face turn red and eyes water, but Sonya knew when he felt at home, and initially, that was enough.
A gushing burst broke the silence of the small patch of grass by the fountain, and the swinging doors to the factory blasted open releasing a murky flow of marbelizing yellow orange and red. 
Sonya jumped up from their blanket splayed out on the grass as Grady darted off into the mess, sludging ankle deep through hot melted Fire Cheese. 
"WHAT IN THE BLAZES!!" He hollered, as Sonya scrambled around trying to save the blanket and picnic supplies before the flow consumed them. 
Grady found Peter at the controls, passed out on the floor, a sputtered balloon hanging limply from his hand. 
His chair was tipped over, and it looked as though his foot had knocked the temperature lever into overdrive as he fell backwards. 
Grady gave him a swift kick in the ribs. 
Peter's body responded by curling inward, but his face showed no pain, as if his brain were uninvolved in the occurence. 
His eyes slowly opened, and he looked up at Grady through a shiny distant screwball high. 
"I saw God that time." He said, and laid back staring at the ceiling, trying to recollect the glory he had just been part of. 
Sonya was on the upper porch now, watching the Fire Cheese ooze past. 
The air was thick with Jalapeno Habanero and Capsacin extract. 
Sonya's eyes were watering, and she knew that Grady was going to get burns on his legs from the cheese, like the speckled chemical burns that the bits of capsacin extract left on your arm if you pressed the cheese against it. 
That's why Peter had been so vital to selling Fire Cheese, because it entailed such a convoluted legal procedure to keep Fire Cheese Incorporated safe from any Capsacin related injuries. 
Peter sold the vitality of such levels of intensity. 
He spoke of the high paying fringe markets that go in for such things. 
Grady wasn't even aware that his product was so sellable, but Peter took Grady's hesitation as an opportunity to prove Grady wrong, and sold the fuckin shit out of it.
Laughing Peter had not begun alone. 
It was not his recipe that made the Fire Cheese. 
He was merely the marketing genius who could give the world cravings. 
He was simply the man who could plant a vacuum inside of you shaped precisely like what he sells. 
He didn't even like Fire Cheese. 
Laughing Peter simply liked selling people. 
He'd stop strangers in the street and ask them where they were going for lunch, only to tell them that while it's a fine establishment, it's not what would suit them best, instead they should try a place over around the corner where they'll get precisely what they're hoping to find. 
Though his input did nothing, neither improving nor detracting from their lunch, he simply felt not satisfaction, but relief that he could cause some small change in the world around him. 
Satisfied with simple reaction, not tied to what type, as if he merely wanted reassurance that he exists, Laughing Peter made friends and left them based on how willing they were to take his meaningless advice. 
Whether it made the world better or worse, whether his goal of being noticed trumped his positive seeming input, and whether he'd still be alive if he weren't so stuck on seeing some flash in the present, all that is totally irrelevant to the story. 
He lived permanently now, so when he ended up with Grady the philosopher cheese maker, it seemed to reek of powder keg, and to some extent such things are inevitable.
Grady had been making cheese since his childhood. 
Gazing into a bucket of freshly pulled milk, Grady was lost in thought one day deep in his childhood, when his grandfather approached. 
"Watchin the cream separate again? You think 'cause you spend all your time drifting in cream thoughts you're any better than the poor bleeding bastards you're floating on?! Just remember, the rest of the world is why you're floating." and Grady was stranded there in the cream island of his own self awareness of brain activity. 
He couldn't apprehend the socio-political construct his dad had just presented him with, he couldn't link his grandfather's isolationism to his own father's transient lifestyle. 
He couldn't find any logic between his grandfather's stone monastic simplicity and his ethereal experience of thought.
10 years later, Grady was a card carrying member of the local cheese makers guild. 
His pursuit of cheese was some complex philosophical metaphor about how milk is experience and through that we have the capacity to add logics and memories, subtract emotional dysfunctions and false suppositions, and come out with the cream of possibility, which than needs to go through some more processes before it becomes the cheese of truth. 
 He made the mistake of explaining these things at a cheese makers guild meeting. 
He showed how we have the capacity to cause seemingly miraculous things to occur, but in doing so we summon their death. 
And the cheese makers laughed and laughed. 
They raised their ciders and gave a cheers to imagination and another to fancy. 
This than turned into a drinking song about a fancy dancer getting chased by a tractor. 
Unwittingly, Grady had given the guild something to dismantle him and keep him marginalized and defensive. 
He had offered them a level of awareness that their rural capacities didn't have the capacity to apprehend. 
But to be self aware necessitates ignoring others, and Grady soon fell away from the cheese makers guild. 
The other members would often mock him, asking him such absurdities as "are we slaves to the cow, or is the cow a slave to us?" and "If cheese ferments in the forest and there is no one around to call it by any other name, is it not still cheese?" and Grady gave up his awareness of sarcasm, and accepted these questions as serious thoughts, and he came up with a series of essays answering the questions seriously and heavily, and on that day quit the guild. 
Leaving the meeting hall, Grady ran into a stranger who seemed to walk as if looking for a student. 
The stranger noticed Grady, and though Grady made a point of not looking over, the stranger jogged up and fell into pace beside him. 
"Greetings fellow human, my name is Peter." The stranger said. 
Grady was immediately taken in by this approach. 
Fellow human? He had never in his life been addressed by species. 
He glanced over and nodded looking a bit confused. 
"I see you're just leaving the community house. 
And what goes on here might I inquire?" 
"It was a cheese makers guild meeting."
"Ah, cheese making. 
Fascinating. 
I always preferred butter, but to each their own. 
What does one do at such meetings? And is it really much of an advantage to join a guild? I don't understand the practice of submitting to another man's flawed concept of how the world ought to be tied down and trussed up. 
I hope you're looking to abandon the guild and aim your development more along the lines of a corporation. 
That would be like the guild except you would be running the place." Peter had been walking since sun up, and was practically gibbering, but his subconscious was sharp and natural enough for everything to come out as if it were intentional. 
He placed his usual negativity in the usual places to create a vacuum within Grady, and he followed it up by suggesting some absurd permutation of present reality that will make Grady hungry, and perhaps give Peter the upper hand.
"Will you help me than?" Grady asked. 
stopping in his tracks, confused as to why he had just blurted out that question. 
It was too quick. 
He had spent so long on those essays addressing the mockery as if it were truth, reaching deep within the ridicule to find the aspects of it that could be salvaged and put to positive use. 
He had just stepped out of the guild, cutting ties with those who had taught him. 
He had just left. 
And all at once, so suddenly, so easily, this stranger at the perfect moment plants a thought. 
Grady knew that he was in the current, and turning around now to see what was carrying him might only cause his foot to snag a rock and him to get pulled under. 
The best thing to do when caught in a river current is to become the surface of the water, skidding along the top, looking down at your feet to see what's coming next. 
To keep from drowning, relax. 
To last longer, relax. 
To live forever, relax. 
So Grady relaxed, and listened to Peter's response.
"I can help you. 
I am an expert. 
But I am tired now, and need rest, so if you have a porch I might sleep on for the night, we can begin tomorrow." And Peter was recruited as the head of Fire Cheese Marketing.
A low fire cackled soft sparkling laughter into the apathetic sky. 
The hum of the electricity in the wires overhead made the desert fauna seem as though searching for a contact point. 
Information hissed along the black vines of industry oblivious to the reality that in reality the information was reality dismantled into materials and rearranged into an abstraction of reality, and the true reality was nothing more than the visual of the black vines, and the low hum of electricty. 
Information is inevitably a lie. 
Physical occurences such as graphite staining shapes into flattened wood pulp, or perhaps a vibrating voicebox and a malleable windchamber to manipulate the sonic experience of vibration, physical occurences such as these are real, but to take these tools and use them to create a parallel experience in a conceptual realm, this is where it immediately and inevitably becomes false. 
There is no truth in a thought, because it is a manifestation of a past thing that occupies the present reality while clouding the future capacities. 
There is no truth in a thought because it is expression born of perspective based on an inability to see the whole due to it being inextricably a part. 
So all stories are false. 
This one especially.
Laughing Peter danced along at the foot of the rock face in front of the flame, his tiny frame casting grand shadows across the scrawled lettering he'd spent the last two weeks carving. 
His work was done and he had only to sign it. 
In the bottom right corner of the rock face laughing peter sat and at long last not laughing, with a shuddering shot gun blast, he splattered the last of his fading mind as signature on last piece.
Laughing Peter left his words, scratched haphazard and madly across the rockface leaving his stain, his story, his brain and his face. 
Laughing Peter left because he had nothing left. 
He was left nothing but to leave, and when he did, there was not much left of him. 
But this display, this slipshod alter, this staging of finality, what prompted it, and to whom is it presented? The skunks and crows pass it with hardly a glance, not even a sniffle. 
Nature goes on uncaring that some tortured human, plagued by emotions of guilt fear and chaos brought on his own gory crescendo. 
Nature goes on as the perpetual orgasm, eternally busting splitting pushing turning and flickering across itself uncaring that Laughing Peter is now not. 
Nature; the grand masturbator, not caught up in fantastical thoughts, rather feeling it’s leaves against its wind, a stone in its water, a squirrel on its limb, Nature is the grand orgy, and humanity is the awkward cousin in the corner, clasping her binder against her turtleneck covered chest, hoping she isn’t pulled in, wondering how she landed here among these lawless chaotic love makers.
as the world around us dies in orgiastic synchronicity.
While Laughing Peter was alive, he truly lived. 
He lived in a way that made his parents die inside. 
He lived aggressively and long into the night. 
He lived on scarcely anything, finding his greatest bluffs when hungry. 
He leapt from town to town throughout his early life, never knowing what it was to be still. 
His bright eyes of childhood had scrambled across a thousand passing landscapes as he grew up hopping trains, tagging along with his no good bastard dad, Laughing Peter was an independent anarchistic roustabout ragamuffin by the age of 12, knowing how and where to make due and what to do to make it, gaining a self confidence and flow which he used to dance between the dangers of a transient existence.
As Laughing Peter grew his eyes kept their brightness, but they took on a parallel darkness that seemed to spiral into him. 
This wasn’t, of course, until Mary entered the picture. 
Mary was a perfect woman, and Peter was infatuated from day one. 
The Fire Cheese Factory had barely opened, but Peter was incapable of keeping his capacities aligned. 
After 3 months of Peter floundering and flailing at his role of co-owner of Fire Cheese Incorporated, his partner Grady finally had enough. 
“You go ask that fucking woman to Mary you or it means the end of the Fire Cheese Factory.” Grady hollered, suddenly snapping his pencil and throwing both pieces across the room at Peter. 
Peter looked up shocked, and quickly darted out the door to propose to Mary during her lunch break at Macy's. 
There is love in all things, for love is carbon. 
And there is nitrogen in all things, for nitrogen is boredom. 
And there is many things in many things, but all things return to love and boredom. 
Jack loved her eternally. 
He loved her from day one until day done. 
Mary loved Jack infinitely. 
From here to the end of the universe. 
Sadly, while time and space are infinitely and eternally entwined, they are not the same. 
Eternal love is not the same as Infinite love.
After Jack’s mother left, Laughing Peter wasn’t able to look at people in the face anymore. 
When you approached him he would glance at his shirt as if checking for stains, than check his pockets as if he had something of yours, than he’d look off to the right, as if checking to see if he was being followed. 
His eyes began spiraling badly. 
He started buying Nitrous Oxide containers, trying to feel like a modern day Gatsby, and in the end he successfully captured some small corner of the Gatsby Experience.
Well done, Laughing Peter.
It was a crisp autumn morning when Angela Lansbury found herself at the dining room table, tea on a saucer, toast cooling on a plate. 
An array of jams, preserves, marmalade and jelly spread before her in anticipation. 
Angela Lansbury holds her tea like a child holds a bird found broke neck near a large window. 
 Her face goes through an array of emotions, wide eyed and pensive, tight lipped and discerning, open mouthed in mild surprise. 
She nurses her tea. 
Her toast looks up at her from the plate. 
How cruel, to be surrounded by such variety of accoutrements. 
“I think, today, that I should like to purchase some new boots.” Angela Lansbury sets her tea down. 
Her mouth makes a small circle and her eyes wander around the room. 
She looks at the toast. 
“You’re nothing like a pair of boots.” She says. 
The toast has nothing to say. 
Certainly the toast was not a pair of boots. 
Wearing toast on your feet would be terribly impractical. 
Unless, perchance you had to walk on a puddle of soup. 
Or maybe you came across a stream of peanut butter. 
 It wasn’t even raining outside. 
Seriously. 
Toast boots.
Angela Lansbury looks out the window. 
She watches a girl on a bicycle ride by. 
She draws the blinds. 
Peeks out through a slit. 
Watches the street, looks back at the toast with disdain and suspicion. 
“Boots, boots, boots!” Angela sings in Broadway fashion. 
Her face dances around inquiry, pleasant shock, and anxiety. 
 She walks lightly in her slippers across a sparse wooden floor.
“Oh, whatever became of my purse?” She talks out loud to no one in particular. 
She is, after all, home alone. 
Angela digs around the closet, the dresser, the hook behind the door. 
She mutters sweet nothings like absentminded crumbs brushed off the table of her own self awareness. 
Her face is a plate of disbelief when the beans of incredulousness have half mixed with the rice of concern. 
The corn tortilla chips of her eyes are heavy with the dip of years.
Angela Lansbury’s eyes drift to her mantle. 
To her eleven awards. 
Marks of achievement in the entertainment industry. 
She’s caught in the pull of a polished metal gleaming without mercy on the mantle above the fireplace she can no longer stoke. 
The fireplace is decorated with dry logs, a poker, and a small shovel. 
Ancient ashes in old brick hearth. 
	On the edge of the valley, nestled within the rocks, the sparse foliage, trees, shurbs and weeds, there’s a church of stone, marble, morter and prayers. 
Three domes stand tall, and a series of bells resound in echos off the far distant side of the valley wall. 
They peel, breaking the morning fog, hanging and hugging, sliding down and cascading, enveloping the rocks and a fox is looking for strays. 
He can hear chickens half a mile down a dirt road. 
He hears the cats, all four of them, mousing in the dew dusted grass. 
The goats, the dogs, and footsteps on stones, the click of sandels, of two dozen or so feet hurrying to morning prayers. 
There’s a chapel on the hill overlooking the complex, a set of rooms, anterooms, workrooms and places to sleep. 
This isn’t a prison, but they’re still called cells. 
The sisters make a black line against the dawn, passing through the garden in single file, wordless, lips moving in prayer and fingers passing over black knotted ropes saying silently, making all the motions lord jesus christ have mercy on me a sinner. 
A heavy set of double wooden doors creak open and they pass in, venerating icons of the virgin mother and the lord and saviour. 
Lighting beeswax candles in front of the alter, making many signs of the cross, lots of bowing and kneeling. 
From a side door, the youngest enters, having called everyone to prayer with the bells. 
Her name at birth was Bethany, but here she is known as Angeliki. 
She left home this year to be with God. 
She is sixteen as of last month, according to the calander that puts her birthday in August. 
She is quiet and reserved, she works hard and spends her mind on day dreams. 
She often wanders in the garden at night, smelling roses and petting the cats. 
Her head is bowed now, trying to concentrate on the icons, the incense, the prayers and oh lord jesus christ have mercy on me a sinner. 
She has callouses between her thumb and forefinger from passing the black wool knots. 
Her prayer rope hangs to her feet and is always in motion. 
She’s too young to be a nun, she hasn’t been fully initiated, she has no set task, so she cleans, tends to the animals, reads and prays. 
	The floor of Angeliki’s cell is spotless save the dust which settles nightly around her prostate form on the hard wood. 
Her bed is always made and if she uses it, she never goes under the covers. 
She lays, stiff, comatose for a few hours a night, lips still moving. 
Her breathing slows and evens out. 
She relaxes all the muscles in her body, only moving her tongue and lips; not making a sound. 
She has few treasures to herself. 
A few books on the lives of the saints. 
Letters from her parents that she keeps next to a picture of all of them. 
A single honey orange rose gives the room some color. 
The curtains are always open, sometimes the window as well. 
Angeliki knows little of the outside world, growing up sheltered, homeschooled, secluded. 
Her parents were kind, soft spoken church goers. 
They tithed, they prayed. 
They read books by the holy fathers to her when they still called her Bethany. 
Her friends are all church friends. 
Her mentors are only known from within the walls and between the icons of a place of worship. 
She knows nothing of the outside world. 
	Father Michael’s voice is old. 
His back is bent just under the shoulders and a long gray beard hangs down to his belly. 
He wears the robes of a Greek priest, golden and silver inlays, white cloth with reds and purples. 
He stand in front of the alter, swaying an incenser, a trail of smoke billowing out from the finely crafted metel, with bells so it makes a shu-ksh sound everytime it comes forward. 
He has been a priest for some thirty-seven years, he lives down the road with his wife, a kind old woman that never ceases to smile in front of guests. 
Her hands have been baking all morning, nice breads and rolls for their house, a little something for the sisters. 
Her given name was Catherine, but she chose the name of Anna. 
She birthed two sons and a daughter. 
One of the sons was killed by a passing car while jogging. 
His picture stands on the mantle, with a fresh dandilion next to it every day. 
His given name was Johnathan and he kept it until the day he died. 
	The service is beginning with prayers and songs, slow hymns in greek with byzantine melodies. 
The choir is divided on both sides of the cross shaped church. 
An array of icons painted far across the atlantic, in the heart of Greece, line the walls, the alter, the domes. 
The virgin and chirst child stare out of unblinking eyes, following you around the room. 
There are no smiles in this room save one sister, stewing in memories. 
She’s remembering the rush of the first autumn breeze, the smell of pancakes with maple syrup and melted butter her father would make on Saturdays; Chimneys exhaling into mid season skies. 
She snaps back to attention and notices Mother looking at her, stern, concerned and a little exhausted. 
Her smile fades and her lips move in silent repetition. 
Her fingers feeling over the knots, pausing at the large one to recite the Our Father, the next large knot for a prayer to the Theotokos. 
Her head is bowed again, and she stares at the marble tiles until the grout blurs. 
Her given name was Emily, but here she is called Irini. 
She was fourteen when she arrived at this monestary, and that was five years ago. 
	The sisters not of song stand scattered on plush rugs of no religious significance. 
They stand in a state of half attention to the service and half to their own prayers. 
The oldest sister stands by the door in the back, mumbling quietly in greek. 
Her parents called her Sarah, but she was given the name Nona when she was initiated thirty-two years ago. 
It was her twentieth birthday, and her parents didn’t know what else to do with her. 
Nona has been to Greece. 
She has seen from an early age, icons that weep sweet perfumes. 
She has seen monks and holy fathers levitate while deep in prayer. 
She talked to a hermit that seemed to receive food from animals. 
She has venerated pieces of the cross of Christ, the Hand of Mary Magdelene, bones, pieces of cloth, all some part of a saint. 
She has taken all of this in, and she still has her doubts. 
Her face is sun wrinkled and tan from working outside most of her adult life. 
She tends the vegetables, and she weaves. 
	Father Michael begins reading the epistle for the day. 
Nina sneezes, twice in rapid succession. 
She covers her mouth with her hands, getting snot and mucas all over her prayer rope, she makes a noise and Mother Thekla clears her throat with an air of authority. 
Nina walks outside, looking for something to clean her rope off with. 
She knows she’s going to get some kind of task for the outburst of disgust. 
Something like animal refuse, or taking things to the compost heap. 
Nina has was initiated two years ago. 
She’s been something of a problem for Mother Thekla. 
Everything that girl touches… Just doesn’t work out. 
She must have arrived here at her wits end. 
Maybe at a monastery she wouldn’t destroy so much. 
Maybe here she will find some kind of peace. 
Her birth certificate states her name as Theresa and only her little brother still calls her that.
Making candles by hand requires patience. 
Dipping and spinning and dripping and dipping again. 
Layer after layer of beeswax
	She’s half asleep, curled fetal on the couch,  there’s a high chance that an old Peter Tosh record is playing on an antique phonograph, expertly restored and crystal clear. 
Her long oak and mahogany trim desk is littered with orange Zig-Zag papers, shake, books and records, both audio and accounting. 
There are two photographs, both in sepia stain, age worn. 
Frozen in time, there she is, whispering in her ear, Day of the Dead parade going on in the background. 
	Graciela…
	There’s a row of empty tequila bottles on the back window sill, dust coated, long since drained. 
 The Skeez herself is reclining, waiting, and mentally going over books in her head. 
There’s a book open on her lap, lists of names and amounts next to. 
 She’s half asleep on the couch, a half burned bowl in one hand. 
Julio knocks twice.
	Knock.
	Knock…
	“Sí?” It comes out muddled and sleepy. 
Croaking and cooing, just some throat vibrations. 
	“Señora, hay un señor en mesa veinte y tres …”
	Sí sí. 
She’ll be right out. 
Gracias Julio. 
Greeting tables, meeting the people, the restaurant people, just a front, really. 
She has a list of various associates. 
Drug people, restaurant people, spiritual people… She could go on. 
People come to the Skeez out of need. 
Be it hunger, money, addictions, she has them covered. 
She’s a matriarch in her own time, at only thirty-two years old. 
 Her hair, long and black hangs in dreadlocks tied together in the back. 
Her eyes, never shallow, dark, penetrating gaze clock-ward. 
First table of the night to play for. 
She saunters out, in robes of silk with Aztec patterns, says greetings and exchanges pleasantries. 
Nods, smiles, all with uncanny knack. 
 She’s a natural, really. 
She pleases; she leaves the guests still in awe, still pondering the mystery. 
She looks like she has something to hide, something really worth knowing about. 
She’s sitting back down on the couch when the phone rings.
	It’s Duck, again.
	“Señora Skeez…”
	“Hey Duck, what’s up?”
	“Oh you know, just lookin’”
	“I see, I see. 
Don’t worry I gotcha covered.”
	“Coo, be over in a minute?”
	“Sweet deal.”
	These hook ups are easy, even if the quantity is small. 
The real cash is in the artists, she figured. 
Cats that have that special something are always looking to get high. 
She likes artists; she’s a connoisseur of sorts. 
She pulls out a large zip lock from the freezer in the alcove. 
It’s the best you can get in town; she’ll put money on it. 
Duck would put money on it. 
He knows The Skeez would never dick around with herb. 
He knows because he’s listened to her expound on the herb, its many virtues and benefits. 
He knows because she feels the herb is sacred. 
That’s a bond he can trust. 
People with spiritual connections to drugs can be trusted. 
He knows how mortals deal with the unknown. 
	He genuinely likes The Skeez. 
He thinks she’s a pretty cool chick. 
She’s only twelve years his senor, and she makes him feel relaxed. 
Like he can tell her anything. 
And that’s how she likes it. 
Duck ain’t so bad, really. 
Just a bit neurotic. 
 But fuck man, who isn’t? She’s goes to the phonograph and puts on some Smokey Robinson. 
Duck will dig it when he gets here. 
She knows how music can sway a mood. 
And Duck was one of the moody ones. 
Lots of ups and downs. 
She didn’t mind really; but business is business. 
He knocks three times in slow succession, peaking his head in the door.
	I don’t like you. 
But I love you. 
	“’Sup Skeez,” It’s really not a question. 
	“Kickin’ it, as per usual, you know how we do.”
	“Rock on.” He picks up on You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me wafting over the dust and haze, now grinning. 
	“So do you have something special for me?”
	“Few things came in today, actually. 
Two strains, I’ve had the Kush before, pretty sure you bought one off me a few months back, good strain, good high, smokes like a dream. 
And then there’s this new one, doesn’t have a name yet, but look at it.”
	It looks glitter coated, sending off disco ball vibes under the light. 
There’s a coating of kief in the bottom of the bag. 
The room is invaded by the smell, like a skunk that’s been rolling around in pine. 
	“Damn…” 
	“Here, we’ll burn one to see if you like it. 
Tequila?”
	“On the rocks, sure.” 
	She sways to the alcove, picks up a dusty bottle and two tumblers. 
She drops five ice cubes in Duck’s glass one by one. 
And the tequila cascades over the top, cracking two of the cubes. 
She plops down next to him, and takes the spoon from the coffee table, smacking it flat on the palm of her hand to get the ashes out. 
They end up in an ashtray that’s shaped like a turtle. 
She packs a bowl, sprinkling a bit of the kief on top. 
	“Also, I got a few grams of hash in, real shit straight from India. 
Mushrooms tomorrow, maybe some acid next week; if you’re looking for some coke, it’s going to have to wait a while, my guy got held up for a bit in London.”
	“Maybe a gram or two of hash,” he receives the bowl in gratitude, sparks it and inhales deeply, right to the diaphragm. 
Passes it back, exhaling, watching the smoke drift to the ceiling fan, always on a slow cycle. 
It creeps up on him, a little more with each puff. 
It has a piney taste, with hints of lavender and lemon. 
It’s been a while since he’s had something this good.
	“Jesus…I’m sold,” He red eyes his surroundings, relaxes, lets the music come at him in waves; tapping his fingers in time with the Miracles. 
It’s a nice high, not too stony, just enough to get shit done and still be pleasantly fucked. 
“I’ll take one of each then, middling for a friend, you know how it is.” 
	“She cute?” She winks and smiles.
	“Yeah, you could say that,” Implications of severe understatements. 
	“You’ve got a bad habit, man. 
Always middling for a cute girl, it’s kinda funny really.”
	“You’d like this one…” grinning from ear to ear and blushing a bit. 
“She’s got a voice like you wouldn’t believe, hits you in the gut and gives you goose bumps. 
My god, she’s adorable, and her eyes…” The way he smiles says more than any words could convey. 
	“She’s just so… perfect…”
	“Awww Duck, you’re adorable.” Empathically she’s grinning right along with him.
	“So yeah, I’m pretty far gone.” He sips a little, letting it sooth the smoke torn throat. 
Red face more so now with alcohol involved. 
	“She got a name?”
	“Callia…Callia Sommer.” Just saying the name gives him a warm rush, tingling and radiating out from the heart. 
He marinades in it. 
“So what’s new with you? Let’s see, last I was here was about, two weeks ago?”
	“Damn, alright, uh,” The Skeez pauses, recollection churning away inside her head.
	“So I’m dating this girl that works down at The Republik, you know that new club off Seventh? She’s alright, you know? We get along pretty well, she’s great in bed; most amazing dark, red hair I’ve ever seen. 
Excellent taste in music”
	“Any drawbacks so far?” 
	“She’s a huge pothead,” Laughing about it now, the both of them.
	“Well shit, who isn’t around here?”
	“Don’t know, can’t associate with those types, really fucks me up, you know?” She’s weighing out the bags, licking the ends after rolling it up. 
	“Did you want to see the hash now, or save it for next time?” She doesn’t need to be a pushy pusher, not with Duck.
	“Let’s save it a bit, call you in a day or two, depending.”
	“That works. 
Whatcha up to for the rest of the day?”
	“First, this delivery, then I’ll be at the Afternoon for a while.”
	“Right on, tell Jolie I said hi.” 
	“As a kite!” They giggle. 
She hands him the double, and he places it with care inside his book bag, one in each pocket, the better stuff marked to prevent mix up. 
He gets up and stretches, says thanks for the tequila and such. 
They hug goodbye and he makes his way to the back door, past the alcove. 
	The air outside is warm, not so bad for early evening, summer weather definitely. 
Duck Augustine is dressed in an old, well worn pair of jeans, a beat up pair of Vans, and a zipped up black hooded sweater. 
He rolls up his sleeves and unzips the sweater. 
Bailamos is located just off Main, right around the corner of 4th, where the old pool hall used to be. 
The outside is simple, tasteful décor, the name painted on in large black letters on tan bricks. 
The remains of a mural, now weather worn, paint chipped, hang on that wall farther down. 
It’s a couple of couples, dancing to a mariachi band. 
There’s a few cars parked along the sidewalk, metered all day. 
The Skeez has one of them rigged so her spot always has an hour left. 
Duck takes all this in, still grinning like a stoned idiot. 
	He reaches into his left pocket, pulling out a cell phone and half a pack of Camel Lights. 
One handed, opens and props one up to his mouth. 
Puts the pack back gently, produces a green Bic from the other pocket and lights. 
Inhale, exhale, all over again. 
The nicotine hits a bit hard on the incredible mellow that’s been going on. 
Callia, Callia, indeed. 
And how she melts me when she smiles, turning all to warm mush on the inside; can’t wait for the next open mic. 
I’d sooner die than never see her again. 
God what a hold, and for only that one time. 
She’s got me in a spell, wrapped around her finger for sure. 
I don’t even want to escape this, this high, this rushing tumbling crazy feeling. 
Better by the second. 
And love really is just another four letter word, (thanks Bob), all void of genuine niceties, bitter implications really. 
And let’s see, three more blocks to The Afternoon. 
On foot, no less, need to get a car, somehow right? Somehow. 
This is how it starts. 
There’s a hangover, and not a nice one. 
It’s going to be a few bottles of wine, beer break, whiskey punctuated with five shots of vodka hangover. 
You’re going to need to take a mean shit before you shower. 
You’ll feel worse as you shit. 
The last liquids in your body will leave you and your head will pound and ache on all sides. 
The shower will steam up and in you go. 
The water will feel much better. 
You might want to drink some, still hot right from the shower head. 
You’ll stand in the water for minutes or hours waiting to feel normal again. 
You’ll scrub your body, wash out your ass, wash your hair, shave your balls and if you’re up to the task masturbate furiously. 
It’s a rough morning and everyone needs a good orgasm now and then. 
Then you towel off, dry up, put on some fresh clothes. 
You have a bus to catch in a few minutes. 
You don’t bother shaving your face. 
There’s no time for that. 
Maybe later. 
The bus leaves at 1:05 and you just make it. 
It costs four dollars for an hour long ride over the brown hills of California summer. 
Your job right now is to observe everything. 
Every sign, every person on that bus. 
Because this bus might crash today. 
Because you might never make it anywhere except the center divide. 
So take a look around right now and keep it up all the way to San Jose. 
At the train station you’ll check the schedule. 
The train will depart in 45 minutes, but you can’t wait that long. 
So you take the express bus which costs 3.50. 
It’s really 1.75 but they charge you 3.50. 
They’re terrible people. 
Bus drivers. 
Don’t worry about it. 
Sit in the back and put your feet up. 
There’s only two of you on this bus so relax, nothing terribly important is going to happen. 
Put your sunglasses on, and try to rest your head. 
The hangover should be receeding by now. 
All the bumps in the road are not going to help whatsoever. 
But don’t worry about it. 
Everything’s going to be fine. 
The brown grass, dead grass hillsides will there. 
The freeway will hum along. 
Just don’t give up your seats. 
You should be taking up three of them. 
One for your ass and two for your legs. 
You paid three fifty, use all of it. 
Otherwise you’re just a sucker. 
That’s not your goal today. 
Don’t be that guy.
Part I
Like most stories this begins in a bar. 
Not a night club, social club, bar and grill, or a pub. 
This is a bar. 
This is where you go to drink. 
When you’re thirsty. 
When sobriety doesn’t sound so pleasant anymore. 
This is a destination of those destined to be drunk. 
There is no food here, no dance floor. 
You’re only distraction is the jukebox. 
Or perhaps that girl sitting at the end of the bar, stirring her drink with her finger. 
She licks it clean and motions the bartender over. 
“It’s not strong enough, pour another shot in.”
She doesn’t need to be polite. 
She’s a very pretty girl. 
People will forgive her. 
She has no need for niceties, nuance, or subtleties. 
The subtle tease sucks vodka off her finger.
“Perfect.”
She takes a long, slow sip, closes her eyes tight and exhales slowly. 
Purpose. 
She aims for intoxication. 
She’s on a mission. 
She looks through her purse and comes up empty. 
Jesus, she’s looking at you. 
Stay calm; we’ve handled these kinds of situations before.
“Got an extra cigarette?” She asks. 
And her voice isn’t mentholated; it’s unfiltered and not light. 
She sounds like Lauren Bacall if Lauren Bacall were a Cuban cigar. 
You have to reply nonverbally, extending your pack, flicking the box open with your index and pushing one forward with your thumb. 
She takes it and you light it, like a perfect gentleman. 
She nods instead of saying thanks. 
You nod back like a sucker. 
She’s going to try and get you to buy the next drink. 
This is where you have to make a stand. 
This is where you put your foot down. 
But there’s a white flag in your pants. 
Your white flag says it’s worth a shot. 
He’s been wrong before.
But really, why not? What’s the worst that could happen? You won’t get laid and spend maybe forty dollars and have a stupid conversation. 
It’ll be a bummer night but at least you got to spend some time talking to a pretty girl. 
That’s not so bad. 
It sure as hell beats spending the night drinking by yourself. 
You finish your drink and order two vodka tonics. 
The bartender gives you this look. 
He gives you the look etched on the face of every bearer of bad news; it’s not his job to save you. 
You’re beyond redemption. 
You bought the girl a drink. 
The bartender sets the glass down in front of her. 
She takes a taste with her finger and motions the bartender back over, pointing at her drink. 
She smiles and bats her eyelashes. 
The bartender shakes his head, reaches for the vodka and pours another shot in.
“You’re such a sweetheart,” She coos, blowing smoke rings over each syllable.
The bartender sighs. 
She lifts her glass at you and smiles, tilting her head. 
You get a good look at the softness of her face, the delicate symmetry at work there. 
Her eyes like two glass marbles pretending to be twin suns going nova at the bottom of the ocean. 
You hope that’s just the out of focus effect of a little too much to drink. 
You say “Cheers,” with as little awkward inflection as possible. 
She moves a few stools closer and your palms sweat. 
You feel a little light headed. 
Now you have to step up. 
Say something, be funny. 
Pretty girls like to laugh. 
You’re charming. 
You’re witty. 
You can do this.
“What’s your name?” She jumps the gun.
You can leave any time. 
You could run, your gut is screaming obscenities at you. 
But you’re a cool guy. 
You play it cool. 
That’s what you do. 
So you give her your name and ask the same question. 
She tilts her head again and exhales three syllables in your ear. 
She taps out “Melinda” on the back of your hand. 
The hair on your neck stands up. 
Blood rushes down artery after artery, flushing your cheeks, swelling your cock a bit. 
Your damn palms are so wet that little pools have formed on the bar top. 
You order some shots and two more mixed drinks. 
Her toes play on your ankle. 
Her fingers dance on a highball glass, skating on the condensation. 
She doesn’t ask you for cigarettes anymore. 
She takes them and you let her. 
You still have to light them. 
Conversation tumbles along. 
Small talk, bar talk. 
Nothing either of you will remember. 
Nothing of consequence. 
You remember her name and two years of high school Spanish. 
Me Linda. 
I’m so pretty. 
Very honest, sincerity in her name. 
She asks you if you live around here but you’re just in town for business. 
The company has set you up with a hotel room. 
She asks you to call a cab and let’s get out of here. 
Everything she says sounds like a good idea. 
You get in the cab after her, cupping and squeezing the mathematically precise curvature of her ass with your eyes. 
In the alcohol fog you’ve forgotten something important. 
That was a company card that paid for those drinks. 
You might have to explain these expenditures to that waifish girl in accounting. 
What the hell did you do with that receipt?
You wake up the next day, early in the afternoon. 
Alone in a sea of once crisp hotel sheets. 
The receipt is on the night stand. 
Right next to your checkbook.
Part II
Bare feet on a clean hardwood floor. 
Comfy jeans and an oversized floppy sweater. 
A well worn, hand-me-down couch. 
Softly clad, sink in cushions; late afternoon television movies and one ashtray five butts deep on a small rectangle of coffee table. 
Mug stains aptly placed in rings along the surface. 
Melinda has earned a day of rest. 
The check cleared; cash in hand. 
Tax free rent money, food money, leisure money. 
Melinda isn’t her real name. 
And black isn’t her natural hair color. 
She runs her fingers through her hair; scratches her scalp. 
Scratches her itch and pulls a long drag from the cigarette between her middle and index fingers. 
Flicks the ash and takes a swig from the tall can of beer in her other hand. 
She won’t have to go out for a few nights now. 
Nice score. 
The month has been taken care of. 
Next month means another bar across town, blonde hair and her name is Bonnie. 
Next month means a short black skirt, Bing cherry red-purple lipstick and a manicure. 
She puts her cigarette out and washes her mouth out with beer. 
 Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre mince words on the TV screen. 
She should shower soon and get some breakfast. 
She should buy some groceries and do the laundry. 
Clean up the apartment. 
Tidy things up a little. 
A whole list of shoulds. 
A list of shoulds that can wait until tomorrow. 
Right now the couch is nice. 
Right now Mary Astor is inspiring her next night out. 
She’s going to finish this beer before anything else. 
She’s going to smoke again, before taking a shower. 
There’s a knock at the door. 
Nelly opens it to see her land lady.
“Hi Ms. 
McConnell.”
Ms. 
McConnell stands slightly over five feet tall. 
She wears tennis shoes, dirt stained, and a denim skirt all the way to the ankles. 
She has on a knit wool cardigan, which she may have made herself. 
Her rusty hair is naturally curly down just past her shoulders. 
For the most part unkempt and unadorned. 
She wears earrings made from sea shells and bracelets made from copper. 
 There’s a necklace there, underneath all that wool. 
Two bright green eyes, semi-wide, stare out from the barrage of her freckles. 
Her lips move without the aid of lipstick.
“Hello Nelly.” She pauses. 
“You know, I was passing by your room just now and I thought to myself, ‘that balcony on 210 could really use some flowers.’ Do you like flowers?”
“Sometimes. 
I don’t like forgiveness flowers, or wedding flowers, or funeral flowers.”
“What about daises? Daises are such happy flowers.”
“I like yellow roses most.”
“Yellow roses?”
“Mmm. 
The color and smell. 
They’re not over used or pretentious like other roses. 
No one sends roses to someone just for being friends anymore.”
“I bet boys send you flowers all the time.”
“No, not really.”
“Really? Not even your boyfriend?”
“I don’t have a boyfriend, Ms. 
McConnell. 
I guess I’m between boyfriends right now.” For some five years or so. 
Give or take.
“Between boyfriends? That’s strange. 
Although, now that I think about it, I never see you bring boys home. 
Your apartment always seems so vacant.”
“I don’t like to bring people over much. 
Peace and quiet, you know.”
“Yes, yes. 
I suppose. 
But it seems strange for a girl your age.” She pauses. 
“Don’t give up my dear. 
Love is out there.”  A true believer. 
A true believer that’s been divorced three times. 
Face to face with the atheist of love. 
The woman that murdered romance in cold blood. 
The voice of the Me Generation. 
Nelly tries not to laugh.
“I have my doubts.”
There’s an awkward pause. 
The eyes of both parties dart about at details, never lingering.
“Oh, yes. 
Nelly dear, it is the 8th…”
“It is?” Now it’s Nelly’s turn to pause for second, trying to conjure up the significance of the 8th. 
“Oh, right, right. 
Yeah. 
Hold on a sec.” She walks inside, rifles through her purse and produces a check.
“Last month and this? Thank you for catching up so soon.” Ms. 
McConnell looks the check over like she’s never seen one before.
“I try.”
“And do put some flowers on that balcony? It looks so lonesome.”
“I’ll see what I can do.”
The door closes and Nelly exhales through pouty, puckered lips. 
She readjusts her hair, pulling her pony tail back. 
She walks back to the coffee table, picks up her pack of cigarettes, extracts one and lights it. 
She sits back down on the couch. 
Part III
It took four outfits to get to this club. 
It took the approval of two of your girlfriends. 
The opinion of the third wasn’t terribly important. 
It took three hours of changing hair, shoes, belts and bracelets. 
Scrutinizing in front of the mirror. 
Hair up, hair down. 
Too much black, not enough. 
It took time, effort, and collective opinion to even get your size zero ass out the door. 
But here you are. 
And you can’t hear a goddamn thing unless it’s shouted two inches from your ear. 
Your friend with the sausage curls asks you to get some drinks. 
You don’t pay for drinks. 
Everyone else pays for your drinks. 
It’s your birthright. 
You were born gorgeous. 
Everyone is continually indebted to you for the privilege of gazing at you. 
Some guy approaches your group. 
He shouts,
“Oh my God!”
You turn and walk towards the bar, looking back every once in a while. 
Your friends are laughing. 
This guy must be hilarious. 
You get two drinks within five minutes. 
This guy at the bar said you have pretty eyes. 
He buys you and a friend all expense paid tickets to vodka and Redbull. 
 Friends three and four are left out. 
You go to the other end of the bar. 
You’re not a bitch; your ugly friends deserve drinks too. 
Not that they’re ugly in the conventional sense. 
It’s just that you’re prettier. 
The boys cat call you on the street. 
You’re beautiful and everyone reminds you of this all the time. 
 You see a guy three stools over from you, drinking alone. 
But his clothes are nice. 
You sit closer. 
You bat your eye lashes and he blushes.
Christ.
You move a stool closer. 
He looks down. 
You throw a general comment out at this guy and look at your friends. 
They’re laughing again. 
That guy must be really entertaining. 
Something interesting. 
Definitely not like the guy next to you.
“You have nice eyes,” He says in shy voice. 
Thank you so much. 
You had no idea.
He looks generous. 
He offers to buy you a drink. 
You say you need one for your friend as well. 
He obliges. 
What a tool. 
Two more vodka Redbulls. 
You say you have to use the restroom and never acknowledge his presence again. 
Your friends are still talking to that guy. 
Upon closer inspection he’s handsome, but not enough to make you nervous. 
His nose is a little wide, he hasn’t shaved today. 
His shirt is almost as loud as the music. 
But his shoes are nice. 
You say, interrupting him,
“What the hell is going on?” Just under screaming volume, distributing drinks to your friends. 
He turns slowly and looks at you
“Jesus Christ, you can wait to talk.” And he turns back to your friends, “Who the fuck is that girl? Are you really friends with her?”
Your friends giggle. 
Your friends are laughing at the attention you’re not getting. 
They’re laughing because Miss Popular just got cut down. 
Nobody tells you when to speak. 
Nobody tells you what to do. 
You have to set this guy straight. 
You take a big gulp of liquid courage, siphoned though a neon orange catch up stick. 
“How do you all know each other?” The man asks.
“Well, Kara and I met senior year,” your friend with the albino sausage curls starts, recounting the story of how your foursome came about. 
She’s rambling and giggling. 
She always rambles when she’s nervous. 
She’s always nervous around boys when you’re all together. 
You can see his eyes darting at you every once in a while, bored eyes searching for distraction. 
He’s trying to be polite. 
“Oh man, you guys are like vultures in this place. 
I bet you’re in here just to talk shit at all the stupid guys being pathetic, and the ugly girls with their pretentious faux chic shit. 
You guys must be so fucking rad.”
That’s all true, you think. 
This guy with the loud voice and the loud shirt has basically got you nailed. 
He can tell you know how to dress yourself. 
That no expense was spared on your appearance. 
That this outfit cost more than two months rent for a downtown loft. 
“And you!” He shouts, facing you and holding your arms. 
“I think I found the perfect guy for you.”
He takes you and pushes you around the club. 
You’re steered towards groups of guys standing around holding drinks up to their chests like shields made from ice and glass.
“No, not that one, he’s too clean. 
You need a bad boy, someone with tats and at least one missing tooth. 
The rest of his teeth should be yellow and cracked. 
And he must! Must! Smell like he bathed in PBR!”
You’re laughing and protesting, but not too much. 
Your head is spinning and you realize that you haven’t had this much fun at a club in ages. 
This guy just doesn’t care; he’s ready to throw you to some insane biker. 
He’ll throw you away like a jewel encrusted bone to a three legged junk yard dog. 
Fearless. 
Utterly offensive and fearless. 
 He steers you outside to a balcony. 
To a view of the city in lights. 
“Fucking finally. 
Fresh air.” He lights a cigarette.
“Got an extra one?” you ask.
“I don’t buy extras. 
I plan on smoking them all. 
Maybe you could earn one. 
Prove to me that you deserve a cigarette. 
Prove to me that you’re worth more than four cents.”
“I’m very pretty.” You say defensively.
“Boring! Beauty is common. 
If pretty girls are a dime a dozen, that makes your net worth less than a penny. 
Try harder.” He’s flaunting every smoky breath.
“I don’t have to try,” you say.
“So you’re a spoiled little princess? Go buy your own. 
I refuse to cater to whatever it is that you’re used to.” He smokes and looks out across the city. 
He’d rather look at the city. 
Something is very wrong. 
“I can play the oboe,” you offer.
“Oh? A musician are we? Well then, how long have you been playing?”
“Since I was ten.”
“Fantastic. 
What do you like to play?”
This is not a question you like to answer.
“I’ve been playing classical in college for the last few years…”
“But what do you like to play? What drives you? What about the oboe makes you want to play it?”
You stammer. 
Words start off your tongue but turn to mush before they leave your mouth.
“So your parents got you started.”
“Yeah,” you say.
He gives you a cigarette.
“For effort.” He says, handing you a book of matches. 
He looks at the city.
You strike a match and watch the flame, making sure the stick catches before lighting up. 
You’ve been neglecting your drink and this catches you by surprise. 
The straw is between your lips and you suck deeply.
“What the hell are you drinking anyway?”
“Vodka Redbull.”
“Jesus, that sounds awful. 
Like medicine. 
Ever drink cough syrup?” he asks.
“It’s not that bad! But I knew a guy in high school that drank cough syrup. 
He said he talked to space aliens and then he got kicked out of class.”
He turns and looks at you. 
Every movement of his eyes evaluates your existence.
“For some reason I thought I saw something in you. 
Something different and interesting. 
Why are you in college?”
“I, well, I’m studying for a degree in business.”
“Great, just what the world needs now.”
“There wasn’t a degree for Love, Sweet Love. 
Sorry to disappoint.”
“A great failure of the university system, to be sure.” He shakes his head and looks at the city.
“What the hell man! Who are you?”
“Some guy, does it really matter?”
“Yes! Yes it matters. 
Don’t you know?”
“Do you want a name? Is that what you need?”
“A name would help, yes.”
“Blake. 
Does that work for you?”
“Lindsey.” You shake his hand and he holds onto it. 
He looks you in the eyes and holds your hand firmly, with your fingers interlocked. 
“And who are you, Lindsey?” He smiles at you now, his eyes are soft and they shimmer.
“I’m a business major that plays a very mechanical sounding oboe.”
“That’s just what you do. 
Who, are, You?” He pokes you on the tip of your nose. 
His eyes dart from your left to your right eye and then your lips.
“I, I. 
I am...” His hand pulls you close from your waist. 
Your lips touch his and your head is spinning. 
The city lights, the breeze, the vodka and spinning. 
Then release. 
His merry-go-round mouth has sent you reeling. 
The next few hours pass quickly. 
Blake takes you out for a milkshake. 
You remember laughing and hanging onto his every word. 
You remember showing him your apartment, making a few drinks and putting a movie on. 
You don’t remember him leaving in the morning. 
You don’t remember him holding you and looking over your shoulder at the ATM. 
You don’t notice your card is missing until you try and pay for dinner later the next day.
Part IV
You’d be amazed how long someone can hit the snooze button. 
You’d be even more amazed how many times a guy can miss the same button he’s been slapping for ten years. 
Press button. 
Ten more minutes. 
Ten more minutes is just enough to drift off to half sleep with heavy eyes until the noise starts again. 
Rinse, lather repeat. 
For hours. 
The window is blocked by a blanket; the sheets are more like a nest. 
There are some five pillows lying about unused. 
Empty cans of Olympia litter the floor. 
Magazines and newspapers, personal ads. 
Weeklies. 
Ashtrays.
Blake’s hand moves under covers, scratching his testicles. 
He yawns and turns over, peeling his scrotum off his leg. 
Blake isn’t his real name, neither is Byron. 
One foot on the ground, another foot on the ground and he’s at least sitting up now. 
He yawns again and thinks about brewing some coffee. 
The thought is enough to get him out of the room.
The living room is a couch and a TV. 
A coffee table and a roommate that only moves his thumbs. 
He says “Hey dude.”
He says, “Hey dude.”
In the kitchenette he rinses out the pot, fills a filter with grounds and presses the button. 
The sounds of water heating, then dripping, then turning blacker by the drop into the pot and the smell that says good morning. 
He could sit and wait until he has a cup ready. 
A shit, shower and shave would get him half way to awake. 
The water takes about ten minutes to heat up, just enough time to shit therapeutically. 
He doesn’t bother to whip his ass; the shower can take care of that without the thought of rubbing shit all over the place before it comes off on the paper. 
He pushes a lever and everything goes away.
Ten minutes later Drake is clean from the bottom up. 
Drake is the name his mother gave him, and sometimes it’s a good enough name to use. 
He combs his hair, brushes his teeth and rinses out his mouth. 
A bath robe goes on, a cigarette in his mouth and he returns to the kitchen. 
The coffee pot is already half empty. 
The roommate moves his thumbs. 
There is no coffee mug in front of him. 
The wrinkles in his clothes have collected dust. 
The roommate’s beard is always the same length. 
His face only changes expression from mild, detached apathy, to partial vexation.
“Hey dude,” the roommate says, “Hey dude, have you ever, well, when’s the last time you shat on your own balls?”
“Huh wha?”
“You know like, maybe you’ve been drinking, and maybe your shit’s a bit on the watery to loose side of things, and maybe your sack just hangs a little lower that morning slash maybe afternoon, or maybe you wiped a little overzealously. 
Or maybe you shat your pants and couldn’t deal immediately. 
And while you were walking, running, whatever to deal with your problem, some shit got on your balls. 
Or you know maybe you weren’t exactly shitting sitting down. 
Maybe you were lying on your stomach and you shat yourself.”
“Dude, on a scale of one to ten, that’s fucked up.”
“I’m fucking serious.” The roommate presses pause to emphasize his point.
“Since when were you ever serious?”
“On a scale of one to ten, I’m about seven point five on the serious scale. 
Seven point five out of ten points of seriousness.”
“Wow, you’ve never been that serious.”
“Whatever, dude. 
I’m always at least a four and then some. 
I was a four and then some with your mom for like two months. 
Then there was that one time when the power went out. 
I was definitely off the serious scale then.”
“Ok, point.”
“No, no point dude; tell me about shitting on your balls.”
“Why all this shit balls talk?”
“No whys right now, just tell me about the last time you shat on your own balls.”
“This is highly ridiculous.”
“On a scale of one to ten, shitty balls could be the most important thing to ever happen to you. 
We’re talking life changing experience here.”
“You shat on your balls when you were a kid, didn’t you?”
“Often. 
Doing so saved me from doing some very unpleasant things.”
“There are things less pleasant than shitting on your balls?”
“Tons of things,” The roommate elaborates. 
“So you’re six years old,”
“No, you’re six years old. 
I didn’t shit on my balls until I was at least twelve.”
“Aha! Now we’re getting somewhere. 
So I was six years old and my grandparents are over. 
Grandma smells like Listerine and Marlboro Lights, Granddad has a lazy eye and Mom is cooking dinner. 
I’m only six so all I ever do is sit in the living room with my hands in my lap wishing I were outside. 
It’s awkward, I’m restless, and they’re talking and talking and talking. 
I couldn’t take it anymore, so I sat there and shat myself.”
“How did that solve anything?”
“I’m not finished. 
Jump ahead two years. 
I’m sitting in class and I’m a runt. 
I have no friends. 
I have yet to discover the joys of my penis and we’re supposed to divide ourselves into groups for some stupid project that only eight years olds do. 
I wanted no part of the matter, so I shat my pants and squirmed in my seat, oozing shit all over my balls, the chair, it’s seeping through my pants, a girl screams and I’m off the hook.”
“Dude…”
“I’m still not finished. 
There’s more.”
“Dude, on a scale of one to fucked up, this is really fucking twisted.”
The roommate scratches his beard. 
Particles fall into the crevices of his clothes.
“The point of all of this, the point of this whole thing, is that shitting myself became an outlet for escape. 
Whenever I needed to get out of a bad situation, I knew I could just crap my pants and squirm. 
The trouble really began when I grew pubes. 
Cleaning shit out of your pubes is a whole new aspect to the shitballs dilemma. 
I like to think of the cleaning part is akin to the rebirth aspect of the Phoenix cycle. 
Like how a phoenix dies in fire, and is reborn from the ashes. 
I die in shit and am reborn in moist towellets.”
“Your logic never cease to confuse and sicken me, dude.”
“Dude, you just need to embrace shitballs logic.”
“I’m not going to shit on my balls every time I might have to do something slightly unpleasant. 
That’s so unnecessary. 
I can deal. 
I can hang. 
I can accept my fate.”
“You’re just mistaking tolerance for acceptance. 
You can affect change and avoid nonsense. 
Just relax your bowels and give a little push. 
Give birth to the brown baby of selective action as opposed to passive fatalism.”
“You’ve been thinking about this for a long time, haven’t you?”
“Years, dude. 
Years.” The roommate reflects on the ceiling, lost in memory.
“Something else you should know about shitballs. 
This came to me during Sunday school. 
My parents were in Mass, and I’m sitting on a rug looking at big, dead Jesus, loin-clothed and just hanging around. 
My older brother had informed me the previous night about how when someone dies, the last thing their body does is release the bowls. 
Giving up the ghost, so to speak.”
“Oh Christ…”
“Exactly. 
So there I am in Sunday school, and father is droning on about sin and death and wages and Jesus. 
I’m still thinking about shitting myself when I die, and then it occurs to me. 
Jesus died naked, with his ass against a cross. 
When Jesus Christ shat on his cross, the shit had to push out around his ass; it had nowhere else to go. 
Logically, it escaped between his legs, right onto his balls. 
So you see, I’m not the only one that escapes things by shitting on my balls.
“You didn’t. 
You really did not just compare yourself to Jesus. 
That is by far the most roundabout, logic stretching, rambling diatribe you’ve ever subjected me to. 
Seriously. 
Just fucking seriously I can’t believe anything I just heard.”
“Dude, if you didn’t want to listen, all you had to do was shit your pants.”
Part V
Like most stories, this ends in a bar. 
 The wooden bar top stretches along, doing what bar tops do. 
The barflies drink expectedly. 
The bartenders pour vodka drinks. 
They pour beer, whiskey, gin, rum, and the occasional glass of wine. 
They do all of this and grumble at meager tips. 
It’s not like they’re making minimum wage. 
The poor bastards. 
The poor bitches. 
The pitcher soaked patrons and everyone in between. 
Tomorrow night they’ll all be here again. 
Some with familiar faces. 
 Some fresh ones. 
Fresh isn’t really the right word for this kind of bar. 
This is a bar after all. 
There are no surprises here. 
Especially not the blond in a tight black dress. 
You should have know she was going to be here the minute you opened the door.
She looks around her and seems frustrated. 
She looks at you once or twice but always goes back to her drink. 
Staring at the bottom of her glass with her head in a hand, with an elbow on the bar top. 
She looks at you like she’s really annoyed. 
Her well manicured eyebrows angle in disgust. 
Her lips tighten and curl into a fingerless fuck you. 
The thing is, you haven’t done anything. 
You just felt like a drink after a long day. 
Just a little night cap. 
Or an after work muscle relaxer. 
A little something for the road. 
She’s not your problem and you’re not anyone’s problem. 
You’re just there. 
That is entirely your fault.
The door down stairs opens and closes. 
A face comes up a flight, accentuated by aviator sunglasses and pomade. 
It’s just after midnight. 
What a clown. 
He’s dressed too well for this bar. 
He looks around like he’s meeting someone here. 
The blond has perked up. 
 Her back straightens, she tidies her hair up a little. 
The new arrival glances in her direction and takes a seat on the other end of the bar. 
He orders old scotch and lights an imported cigarette. 
He tips entirely too much and the bartender has already claimed the real estate closer to him. 
Finally, a reason to have gone to work tonight.
The blond gets up from her stool, takes her purse and coat and walks right behind him. 
She lets her coat brush against his back but makes no other acknowledgement of his existence. 
She goes to use the ladies’ room. 
She returns ten minutes later and the stranger hasn’t taken more than two sips. 
She sits two stools away. 
“A cigarette for a lady?” she asks.
“No.”
“No? What does that mean?”
“It means you have been denied.”
“You don’t have a spare?” 
He laughs at her. 
“And I suppose you want me to buy you drink too?”
The girl looks confused. 
She doesn’t understand. 
Tonight is not her night.
“Look, I’m sorry. 
Maybe I got started on the wrong foot.”
“You were wrong well before you started walking over here. 
Both times.”
“Fuck man, what’s your problem?”
“You left half a drink where you were sitting before, grab and come back over. 
Then we can talk about my problem like civilized human beings.”
“Oh jesus…”
“Yeah, I’d say subtlety isn’t exactly your strong point.”
The man waits a while while the girl fetches her beverage. 
He sips his scotch slowly and inhales in between. 
Fire water and fiery air. 
Earthy tobacco on fire and now nothing but smoke. 
She sits down again with a drink in hand. 
A drink to lips and down the hatch and now nothing but an empty glass.
“So about that drink you were going to buy me…” But he just laughs at her again. 
Not a loud laugh, or really, even a mirthful one. 
Just a little chuckle that reminds her that he’s no fool. 
She can try and trick him, but he’s not going to fall for it. 
And if he’s even a little nice to her, it will be on his own terms. 
She calls the bartender over.
“Three wise men on the rocks. 
And another straight up.”
“Are you trying to get me drunk?” he asks.
“Yes.” She says, “Yes I am.”
“Fair enough, honesty appreciated and all that. 
But what brings you here? Why this bar on this night?”
“Thought I was meeting someone. 
Thought it was going to be a good night. 
Haven’t met anyone but a handful of losers and stereotypes so far. 
This bar may be a joke. 
I haven’t decided yet. 
The jukebox is decent enough.”
“The jukebox hasn’t been changed in twenty years. 
Neither have the patrons.”
“You really don’t expect me to believe you’ve been going to this bar for twenty years, you’re what? Twenty seven?
“Twenty five. 
Give or take.”
“So you’ve been going to this bar for four years at most? Maybe a few more if you’re clever.”
“Actually, this is my first time. 
Expecting a larger turn out. 
How disappointing.”
“Thanks.”
“Well, I don’t know about you yet. 
You’re just another face as of right now. 
Give me something to go on.”
“Like what? ‘Oh hello sir, I’m a lost little girl in the big city with all my hopes and dreams in a row… Just hoping to meet some new friends…’” She shifts her pitch up an octave to emphasize innocence.
“Trite. 
Trite but effective. 
No, you can’t get to know someone in a sentence. 
Let’s begin with introductions,  ames and all that.” He extends a hand and waits. 
She hesitates, looking at him a long time. 
Then her hand meets his and they both wait for the other to start.
“…Nelly…” She says, drawing every bit out.
“…Drake…” he says, feeling no need for the first time in a while to hide behind a moniker. 
The way they say their own names as if they are strangers shaking hands with the image in a mirror. 
Uncomfortable with the syllables that emcompass inherited labels. 
For a while they both frown at something off to the side. 
Then remembering that, hey I was about to start a conversation with a stranger…
“So… Nelly… who was this dude you were so set on metting?  Boyfriend? Husband? Business?”
“Um, business.” She answers skittishly. 
“What about you? You stand out at this place like a clean shave at a ZZ Top concert. 
What the hell brought you here? To drink old scotch and smoke expensive cigarettes?”
“I was, uh, supposed to meet up, with a friend… She must be running late.”
“Uh huh. 
Isn’t she always?”
“No sense of time. 
Bitch needs a watch.”
“Oh, a bitch is she? When do I get to meet her? We might have something in common.”
“Maybe later. 
Maybe if she’s not going to be a flake tonight.”
“Waiting on a flake? That sounds like a perfect night. 
How’d you meet her?”
“Personal ads. 
Single White Female seeks scotch drinking deviant for evening of folly. 
Something like that.”
“And you responded? You actually took her up on that?”
“Well sure, I mean, why not? I can drink scotch.”
“Slowly, but obviously.”
“Besides, she’s Irish.”
“How do you know that? You haven’t met her yet.”
“Because she’s late.” He says taking a longer sip than usual.
	The outside of The Afternoon is all tables and umbrellas, café seating for about fifteen. 
White furniture; whicker chairs and glass tables. 
There’s a neon open sign, on until midnight, down and to the left of a hand-painted welcome sign; and The Afternoon painted in letters made from clouds. 
There’s a stage in the corner, and a small shelf of books on the wall. 
Notebooks and pens, some basic art supplies can be purchased in a tiny shop, opposite corner of the stage. 
The bar stretches along the opposite wall from the door, heavy oak top, well polished and worn from use. 
Stools, floor bolted in a row of seven sit with enough room for your feet to dangle. 
 No two of the tables on the floor is the same, or any chair with a twin. 
Most of it was salvaged, lots of here and there stuff. 
Jolie restored some of them and let the others proudly show their age.
	Jolie Praddle rebuilt this place damn near from the ground up. 
Used to be an antique shop, all dust and neglect; grandfather clocks and rocking chairs. 
Jolie wanted a scene; neurotics and genius intermingle within her walls. 
She wanted talent to surround her, a mother hen to the few consumed by creative drive. 
She has the apartment upstairs, which is more of a warehouse. 
Or a museum. 
She has her instruments, the flute and cello, and a Steinway against the wall. 
There are paintings, framed and stacked, a few are hung up. 
She’ll rotate them later this month. 
She has her first composition hung next to her BA in music theory. 
On the floor and a few shelves are stacks of LPs, all kinds of stuff. 
A turntable, neatly cleaned and dusted, cared for and frequently used rests on a small table; there’s a Joan Baez record on there now.
	The place smells like tea, toast and butter. 
She usually keeps a kettle on the stove. 
She picks loose-leaf teas expertly and has them all in glass jars on the shelf above the range. 
Labeled, with notes about each flavor. 
And a little strainer filters them. 
She sits in front of the coffee table, thumbing through a book of water color landscapes. 
She’s looking for something spring time, something new and wet and bursting. 
Her kettle sings again and she sets the book down, marking her place with a note pad. 
	The kettle is removed from the heat, lid open to let a bit of steam out. 
The strainer is set with a few cups worth of an orange mint tea, floral with a citrus finish. 
She lets is steep for a few minutes, bobbing the tea up and down in the rapidly coloring water. 
The shade grows deeper with every dip, until it’s just right. 
The cup is left on the counter until it’s cool enough to touch. 
Jolie gets her slippers and a robe, walking down the steps into the back room of The Afternoon. 
She flicks on the lights and sets the thermostat. 
The small kitchen hums to life. 
She turns the brewers and the grinders on, the ovens, but not the sign just yet. 
She unlocks the front door and picks up the newspapers, turns and relocks the door. 
She sets a stack in a stand for anyone that needs something to read. 
She takes one back with her up the stairs and fetches her tea cup. 
	She sips after blowing over the surface sending steam clouds rolling upward, taking in slow the hot tea. 
Feeling warmer in the morning cool with every bit more. 
She scans the headlines, the weather, the comics. 
An old habit to check the obituaries, just in case. 
She reads her horoscope but doesn’t believe it. 
It’s a slow news day and she takes a shower. 
She stands in front of the mirror, now clean, brushing her dark, red hair and studying her naked form. 
Never satisfied and always drawn to flaws. 
Her face wrinkles and frowns, eyes meeting eyes in the mirror and crossed now, she sticks out her tongue giggling. 
“You’re not so bad, really,” she tells her reflection. 
	In the closet Jolie finds a blouse and a pair of jeans, she pulls underwear and a bra from the chest of drawers adjacent. 
She puts everything on, slow and tired and careful. 
She pulls her long red hair into a pony tail, gives one last check in the mirror, straightening the edges of her shirt. 
She heads back down the stairs, stepping lightly on each of the twenty-four steps and hears the back door open.
	“Mornin’ Jolie.” It’s Iris.
	“Hey kid, how’s it going?” Yawning big mouthed, steady and holding her tea cup.
	“Ah man, it’s so cold this morning, woke up with Leviathan still one-twenty deep and my glasses crooked again. 
I’m never going to finish Hobbes, he’s so dry.” Iris Celestiene has been spending the last few of her sixteen years going over major works in western philosophy. 
Her book shelves at home are lined with paperbacks, spines all bent to hell, pages creased in the corners marking previous pausing points, making everything a little thicker. 
This is her thing. 
She collects ideas. 
During the days when she’s not finishing school work she bakes and works the register. 
	“Hobbes is pretty thick reading,” Jolie says. 
Having spent college wrapped up in music theory, she still managed to take enough philosophy to pretend she can follow the conversation. 
“So before you get started, we’re going to need a batch of cinnamon rolls and croissants, maybe some raspberry scones, just to be safe.” As she wakes up, caffeine hitting in all the right places, her voice carries a slight sing-song rhythm. 
	“’Kay, I’ll get on it.” Iris is thumbing through a book of CDs, looking for The Violent Femmes. 
She checks the oven temperatures; pulls the ball of puff pastry dough from the cooler and sets it on the three by four hardwood board resting on an island in the middle of the room. 
Surrounded by stainless steel reflections, distortions from dents set by previous owners; She mixes the frostings, the blend of sugar and cinnamon, chocolate and chili. 
She rolls the dough out for the buns and scones, rolls the puff pastry into sheets which she brushes with melted butter. 
Her brush works up down, up down; she can smell the butter, and she’s humming American Music. 
She cuts off a square, folds it into a crescent and places it with care into the fiery furnace. 
We cannot readily stress the importance of careful quality control, these things are very important. 
Without these rigorous tests, without checking everything with strong discretion, without calculated and careful consumption of all these delicious doughy delicacies. 
Well, without all that the whole thing wouldn’t be worth a shit now would it? She knows with no small degree of certainty that the croissants will be fine. 
However, hunger dictates that a little fresh pastry never hurt anyone. 
Most important meal of the day and all that. 
Hard to beat fresh baked anything at this hour. 
	Jolie calls back, “Oh! And we’re going to need couple of quiche. 
There’s some fresh chives and lardons in the cooler.” Quiche makes everything better. 
Still she’s got quite a list before opening and inhales the remainder of the croissant, trying to savor what she can of the sweet, flakey pastry. 
All buttery and consistent light crunch, crunch to dissolve on the tongue. 
She switches out the CD for some Social Distortion, picking up the pace and folding croissants with mad, feverish fingers. 
Sheet pans hit racks to cool, the whole place smells of fresh breads and sweets. 
She prepares lemon custard, whisking the yolks and sugar, lemon juice, honey and cream. 
She steams a cup of milk and honey, sipping sporadically with dough crusted fingers and all-purpose flour speckled face. 
Her short mocha colored, slightly curly hair is hidden under a blue and black bandana. 
She sings to herself, “…She never seemed to notice that this silly, school boy crush, wasn’t just pretend.” Voice dropping to comically low levels for the background vocals. 
	The timer on the wall begins beeping rapidly, meaning the cinnamon rolls are ready to cool. 
She pulls them and puts the pan on a cooling rack, where they will wait until optimal temperatures for the spreading of sweet cream frostings. 
She double checks the sweetness, making sure all the flavors are there. 
She drops cookie dough with a two ounce scoop onto a greased pan, watching them bake and rise. 
	Jolie turns on the sound system in the front and checks all the tables and chairs. 
There’s a head poking around out front, silhouetted by the now risen sun.
	“Fifteen minutes, and we’ve got a head out front!” 
	She curses people with watches set fast and gives the place a quick double check, makes sure the brewers are full, plenty of cups and mugs. 
She walks to the front, flicks on the sign and unlocks the door. 
The man that was hanging about the front door enters and the bell rings. 
He says good morning and walks up to the counter. 
Jolie’s seen him a few times before, one of those early risers. 
He’s married by the ring on his finger and has a picture of two children in his wallet. 
He orders a large vanilla latte and a sesame seed bagel with cream cheese, toasted, please. 
He’s dressed in well worn blue jeans and sandals. 
His blue shirt marks the anniversary of some blues festival. 
He’s balding like a fryer; he wears a thick brown-black moustache with salt and pepper overtones. 
He drives a green Subaru, parked a block away. 
As Jolie takes the cash she notes his hands. 
Scars and black-blue thumb nails, hammer struck a few days previous. 
	Jolie steams the milk, pours in a double shot of espresso and a shot of vanilla syrup. 
She leaves the lid off and places the cup on the counter. 
The bagel halves slide off the toaster oven and she picks them up. 
Plain cream cheese spatula spread, thick and rich. 
She presses the halves together and slides it into a paper sleeve. 
	“Thanks again,” Jolie says handing it to him.
	“Have a nice day,” the man says, looking into her green eyes and taking a big sip, leaving foam traces between the hairs on his lip. 
He licks them off and walks to the door. 
“Who was that?” Iris yells over two songs simultaneously from deep in the heart of the kitchen. 
	“Moustache guy,” Jolie replies over Even in Blackouts and Simon and Garfunkel. 
	It starts soon afterward, the mad rush of slow, soon to be woken citizens looking for a little warm something. 
Perhaps a light breakfast. 
Something sweet maybe. 
Iris is cranking up the radio now, breaking a sweat- now bobbing and kneading with reckless abandon. 
She’s making muffins to the sounds of Minus the Bear. 
Her fingers working in the flour furiously. 
She pushes her glasses up her nose, leaving white finger prints. 
She pulls sheet pans of gooey hot cookies from the ovens pitching them on cooling racks; Pulls no bake cookies from the cooler, placing them with care into a basket and running them up to the front display case. 
Switching out the old one and munching on the broken bits still left at the bottom. 
She throws the linen liner into another basket, later to be laundered. 
There’s a lull for fifteen minutes and Jolie steps out back for a smoke, leaving Iris register bound.
	Behind the Afternoon is all dumpster and recycling bins. 
There’s a couch and a butt can placed there for the same purpose to which Jolie has now occupied herself. 
Inside the phone will ring in about ten minutes. 
Right now she’s inhaling slowly, pulling at the spark on the tip of tabacco. 
Watching the paper burn and turn into carbon and smoke. 
She feels it fall into her lungs, closes her eyes and lets it escape out of the mouth and nostrils. 
She flicks the ash carelessly and sighs. 
She could use a sandwich in a minute, something warm. 
Maybe toasted foccacia bread with sun dried tomatoes, red onions and swiss cheese. 
Maybe roast beef, maybe roasted turkey. 
It’s a lot of maybes today. 
She flicks off the end, sending a finger crushed butt can-ward. 
	Iris is settling the syrups in the cabinet, keeping things in order. 
	“I was thinking about getting some sandwiches from down the street, want anything?” 
	“Hell yeah! I could totally go for a reuben right about now, yeah, thanks.” Iris pushes her glasses up and brushes her bangs out of her face. 
	“’Kay, be back in a few.” The bell on the door rings.
	Iris watches her leave and wrinkles her nose. 
She takes the opportunity to change out the classic rock for something a little more modern. 
She finds a burned copy of Bloc Party’s debut album and sets it on the CD tray. 
The first track comes on in a cascade of squeeling guitars; drums, pounding and thumping and crashing all around. 
She hits on the rhythm and restocks for the slow few minutes. 
Sets more napkins in the dispenser, wipes down the counter, brings more cups from the back, and satisfying the occasional customer. 
Jolie returns with a brown paper bag; within the sandwiches. 
She has a local weekly tucked under one arm. 
The sandwiches come out of the bag and on to the counter top along with the paper. 
She sorts out whose is whose and they drink a chai tea together. 
	“Dad called while you were out,” says Iris between mouthfuls. 
	“Oh? And what was he up to?” says Jolie in half chewed words.
	“Wants to know if you want to meet up at that Greek place downtown to discuss the new gallery show.” Iris clenses her palette and rinses bread crumbs from between her teeth with the warm tea. 
	“Awesome, now I get two lunches.” Wonder where I’m going to put it all.
	“Well, then I’m taking a break while I can. 
Got a smoke I can bum?” Iris is trying to sound mature enough to convince her. 
	“You know where they are,” She raises an eyebrow. 
	Iris gives her a look like, thanks for the guilt trip mom. 
I may not be legally entitled to this pleasure, but it’s not unfamiliar; it’s a comfort thing, it’s a mature thing. 
Duck never guilts her for bumming smokes, even buys her a pack from time to time. 
Duck also can’t say no to pretty girls, regardless of blood ties. 
He’d probably be by later; he almost always stops in, if only for a minute. 
She grabs Leviathan on her way out back, bookmark unshifted from her previous attempts to gain a few pages the night before. 
She flops on the couch, and sparks the bright green bic always in her pocket, bringing the flame towards her face and sucks the heat into the delicate white cylinder. 
She cracks open the book and traces her free finger to her last paragraph, blowing smoke down between the pages. 
	Through the front door in walks a leg followed by another, jean clad and moving with all the grace of a dedicated pedestrian. 
The bottoms of his shoes are well worn from constant concrete caresses. 
The shoes themselves used to be a light brown, but weather and elements have taken their toll, making things a few shades dark with dirt. 
He wears a black hooded sweater, ripped slightly at the neck, cord removed soon after purchase, rips in the cuffs soon afterward, mostly by accident. 
The zipper is half way down to his stomach and he wears a simple red t-shirt. 
His face is clean shaven, his dark brown hair clean and short. 
His large brown eyes a little blurry and scanning the room for familiar faces. 
He spies Jolie at the register who looks up at him as the bells clang against the door. 
	“Hey Duck, right on time.” She’s warm and this is very routine. 
	“Hey beautiful, how’s business?” He’s all smiles, eyes and all. 
	“Usual weekday nonsense, what are you up to? Chronic lay-about that you are,” She says in slight rib jabbing tones. 
Sympathetic to the lazy artist. 
All the creativity and only half the drive. 
	“Gathering inspiration, admiring my muses.” Meaning he’s stoned and checking out chicks. 
Red eyes revealing everything in between the words. 
	“How’s Liz doing?” Not the most eager of subjects, but these things must be discussed. 
	“I dunno man, she’s getting all distant on me. 
I don’t get it, she’d just rather sit around the house, doped up and watching Dr. 
Phil and Oprah.”
	“Is she still living with her parents? How old is she?”
	He sighs, “Twenty-two by birth, about fifteen by action.” He’s already painted a negative picture, facing an unpleasant inevitability. 
He makes a face. 
	“So, my uncle said something about a gallery show later this month, have you seen what he’s been working on?” Change the subject, let’s not dwell on the unpleasentries.
	“First I heard of it was this morning, Iris said he called earlier, speaking of, need to call him back, do me a favor and fetch Iris out back, could you two mind the place for a while?” Duck isn’t technically employed, but he knows the place. 
	“I can do that, I’ll bring her up.” He walks through the kitchen, eyeing the stereo that’s run out of CD to play. 
He pushes open the back door and gives it a shave and a hair cut. 
	“’Sup Cous?” He says it to sedate after the startling knock that snapped her out of a literary trance. 
	“Duck!” She leaps up and gives him a hug. 
“How’s yourself?”
	“Oh, you know, waking up, kinda. 
Jolie needs us to get inside and watch things while she goes out with your dad. 
Scandalous behavior, I expect nothing less from those two.”
	“Please, Dad’s not like that, you think everyone’s fucking on the side.” She’s trying to give him a look.
	“Well, they should be.” Pausing between, “I’m kidding, you know I don’t think that, and besides, I love your mom way too much to wish that upon her.”
	“You love everyone’s mom, you dirty little whore.” She punches him in the arm.
	“I get around.” But not really.
	He holds the door open for her and closes it softly behind them. 
He watches her move across the kitchen floor, almost bouncy. 
He goes to the radio and finds something to put on. 
The case is well worn and has seen a bit of travel. 
He leafs over everything once and works his way backwords. 
An idea occurs to him and he reaches into the bookbag at his side, purducing a CD case of his own. 
He opens it to the back and pulls a freshly burned mix of Beatles songs. 
The disc spins to life and the first pluckings of Blackbird dirft and reflect off the ovens and tables and utensils and make their way out to the register.
	“Oh, do bring that up here, let’s put it on the main system.”
	Jolie nods at the idea and gathers her keys and purse. 
	“Call Cyril if you need anything. 
And Duck, help yourself to a scone or something. 
Just don’t burn the place down.”
	“I think we can manage,” Iris says.
	They watch her leave. 
Duck pours himself a cup of coffee and looks at the pastries. 
All the golden brown, the rich chocolates and creams. 
	“I’ll find something in the back,” He says and walks over to the island.
	A customer walks in and puts his backpack on a couch. 
He pushes sandy blonde bangs from his forehead, exhailing, eyeing the menu, uncertain. 
His weight moves from foot to foor, still undecided. 
A look of impatience crosses Iris’s face, she instigates,
	“Can I help you?” she says.
	“I hope so,” he says. 
“I can’t have dairy or nuts, do you have anything to eat that won’t kill me?”
	“We have vegan brownies and muffins, but they’re no where near as good as the real thing. 
Also the ginger cookies and lemon drops should be alright.”
	“Soy or rice milk?” he inquires.
	“For coffee? Either or.” Picky picky, I doubt it would kill him anyways.
	“Soy latte then, easy on the foam.” I expect nothing less.
	“Sure thing, it’ll be a minute.”
	Duck is puttering around the kitchen looking for odds and ends and loose bits to make some semblance of a meal out of. 
He hears the conversation at the counter and shakes his head. 
These people, he thinks. 
These people are going to be the death of decent eating. 
He hears a rap at the back door and sees a week past shaven head poke in, hand still knocking on the wood.
	“Motherfucker.” Duck says, shaking his head.
	“Duck man, sup? You stuck here?” He let’s himself in a few more feet and slaps palms against Duck’s, tapping knuckles white in fist form on the follow up.
	“Yeah for a few, Jolie had to step out and lunch with my uncle. 
Dunno when she’s getting back, could take a while.” This won’t do at all.
	“That’s no good man, you should run with me to Gypsy’s place for a minute. 
You think Iris can handle things for fifteen?” This is Shea Digit. 
He is before all things a buisness man. 
He is, directly after that, completely out of touch with the notion of time and scheduale. 
He is after all, a drug dealer. 
And that’s life on the hustle. 
	“I dunno man, lemme check. 
I don’t think it’ll be a problem.” 
	The main stretch of town is mostly restaurants, banks, cafes, small window shops, a salon or two. 
A clock on the side of the First National reads three-thirty and a scrolling banner reads seventy two degrees. 
You could say it’s mostly cloudy. 
Inside one of these banks a teller is handing over a loan form on yellow paper. 
She slides it through the window with a blue plastic pen with the banks name printed on it. 
She says to come back when this is filled out and the lady at desk to the right will take care of it. 
She gives a quick nod to the next person in line, signaling that it’s their turn now, and off you go ma’m, have a nice day but please don’t stay because I’m really close to my lunch break, but I need to deal with the last two people in this line and yes, someone else can assist you with that if you have any questions. 
Her name tag says Trisha and her hair is straight, strawberries and cream blonde. 
The woman she was assisting takes a seat in this black leather lounge chair with wooden legs, stained a deep red brick brown. 
Now seated, she crosses her thin legs, idly tapping her shoes together. 
The shoes are brown, but more like auburn brown. 
She had her solid chestnut hair cut recently for the weather, shoulder length, bouncy, easy to manage. 
She’s dressed in jeans and a short sleeve t-shirt she found at a thrift store. 
The shirt advertises a freight company that went out of business when she was seven. 
She finds a book to set the paper on in her lap, so the pen doesn’t poke through, forcing her to deal with that bitchy girl at the counter. 
She almost wants to get back in line, but really she has better things to do. 
The money from this loan is going to pay for a new exhaust hood. 
She brushes the hair out of her face and exhales loudly, like a sigh, but more breathy. 
She frowns at the teller, wrinkles her nose and starts at the top of the page. 
The basic information goes down quickly, name address, account numbers, amount needed. 
She stares at the words Rachael Vox and thinks hey that’s me. 
She looks over the address and everything is in order. 
She double checks the numbers, gives it one final look and walks to the lady at the loan desk, handing her the sheet all caution tape yellow in hue.
	The immediate firsts are her bitch face. 
Her glasses on a chain being pushed to her sharp bitch nose, her make-up caked face, the mole on her chin with a stray hair poking out. 
Her hideous mauve and orange circa nineteen seventies power suit coat and an equally hideous lime green blouse. 
She’s probably around forty-five, but her makeup adds ten years. 
Her name tag reads Hilda, but it’s short for Hildegard. 
Rachael extends an arm lead by a hand in a gesture of greeting; with airs of we are here to discuss business matters, specifically my desperate financial situation. 
Rachael can feel the soft pack of Luckies burning a hole in her pocket and she fiddles with the pen nervously. 
She says, “Hi, I’m Rachael and I need a loan.”
	Hilda, short for Hildegard says, I can read that, thanks, have a seat but you’re already sitting. 
Completely ignoring the extended hand. 
She glances over the paper, sees St. 
Helena’s Soup Kitchen, and raises an eyebrow. 
She coughs and taps a pen on the desk, lots of hmmms and I sees. 
Rachael reads one of her business cards for the fifth time, trying not to read Hilda’s bitch face, trying not to exude loathing. 
And Hilda, short for Hildegard looks up at the pretty girl in front of her, with her still skinny legs well clad in those jeans, her thin frame and pert conservative bust. 
Her hips that haven’t passed a child. 
She follows up to her pleasant face, lacking in age lines, and save for a few wrinkles on her brow. 
She follows her bright green eyes and freshly trimmed brunette hair, her cute as a button nose. 
Her ringless fingers. 
Her twenty dollar department store wrist watch. 
Her skepticism from the canary yellow document has changed to envy of her looks and glaring disapproval of her unmarried twenty-five year old finger. 
She readjusts her glasses, then removes them. 
Sighs looking downward and face still down looks straight ahead at the now hussy in front of her. 
This young woman, this young woman that needs a loan for an exhaust hood so she can cook soup for vagrants and bums. 
This pretty little tart that doesn’t have a man to take care of her, this dirty trampslutbitch that doesn’t live her life properly. 
This unstructured harlot, looking for a loan she can no doubt not pay back any time soon. 
This uppity self righteous whore that leeches off the charity of others. 
And Hilda short for Hildegard excuses herself for a minute, she needs to check on something with her supervisor. 
And Rachael knows what this means. 
She jumps up and across the desk, laying her hands around her fat neck, over the gaudy necklaces and gripping the thick bull fat neck of the bitch in front of her. 
The skin envelopes her fingers, folding over her hands. 
She wrings her like a gym towel screaming and shouting, watching her flail about, the undulating waves of cellulite start from the swinging mass of her underarms. 
Her green eyes flash fire, she breathes brimstone and smoldering seventh circle smoke exits her nose
	STUPID FAT FUCKING BITCH FUCK YOU (gargling noises) FUCK YOU FUCK YOU ITS ONLY MONEY ITS FOR A MISSON HOUSE (her veiny blue face stares ahead with the underside whites of her eyes) I HAVE PEOPLE THAT NEED ME I HAVE PEOPLE THAT RELY ON ME JUST (Rachael takes a hand off and slaps her hard across the face) BECAUSE (slap) YOU (slap) HATE (slap) POOR PEOPLE (her pudgy pepper pot body shudders violently) FUCK YOU.
And Hilda (short for Hildegard) returns and says, sorry but we can’t process this at the moment, I’m afraid without the proper collateral or some kind of guarantee of payments
	And Rachael has already pushed open the glass swinging doors with her fists clenched and reached for her cigarettes. 
Under her breath she exhales “That fucking bitch-ass cunt motherfucker.” Guilt sets in as the syllables form off her lips and tongue. 
She mutters more curses and inhales the nicotine to the bottom of her lungs. 
The smoke absorbs into her tissues, her blood stream, hits her central nervous system, her body sighs in relief and she curses again. 
She looks at her phone and selects the Skeez’s number, not dialing yet. 
She’s thinking it’s time for a cup of coffee before she resumes her hunt for funds. 
She’s thinking a cup of coffee and half this pack of smokes sounds really good right now. 
The sky is overcast and it’s about fifty-six degrees, give or take. 
Her twenty dollar department store wrist watch reads four in the afternoon.
	She flicks ash off the cherry and starts walking down the sidewalk. 
One way traffic passes her by, a city bus, two mini-vans, a station wagon and a Chrysler truck lifted several inches. 
A maroon sedan with a dent in the bumper waits at the corner, turning signal blinking in anticipation of an opening. 
In the spaces between buildings light creeps over and through cracks, steel and concrete canyons, brick and mortar monoliths. 
Their shadows pale from the homogenous spread of sunlight over cloud cover. 
A breeze picks up and Rachael shivers, cursing her sweater neglected in the closet, her lack of foresight; a newspaper on the desk containing forecasts predicting recent weather changes. 
But she hasn’t grasped that yet. 
She ducks in an alley, shielded from the wind, rising steadily to gusts. 
 She looks down at her chest self consciously and god damnit. 
The hairs on her neck and arms stand up; a chill runs down her spine. 
She switches her cigarette hand, warming the previous one back up under her arm. 
Waits for it, and heads back to the sidewalk, arms across her chest, half a cigarette hanging out of the corner of her mouth. 
She watches her feet move forward, starts counting the steps. 
The Afternoon sits a few blocks ahead, brick and mortar; two stories tall, right on the corner. 
The open sign glows iridescent behind the glass of the door. 
And two hundred sixty-five, two hundred sixty-six… The door swings open and out, pushed by these two guys rough around the edges, with shallow, paranoid sunken eyes, unkempt and weary looking. 
Rachael pauses to flick the butt into the street and waits for these guys to move away from the door. 
	The inside lights hit her blinking; retinal adjustments. 
The sound system sends vibrations that bounce off ear drums sending a signal, firing synapses to tell you that this is Here Comes The Sun by The Beatles. 
An aroma of roasted beans floats over the tables, the chairs, and half a dozen bodies, seated or browsing, reading and writing, typing on laptops and just sitting quietly. 
Iris sits on a stool behind the counter looking up as a bell on the door rings. 
She puts down her book entitled Sophie’s World, inserting a bookmark made from an old time slip. 
Brushes the hair out of her face and takes off her reading glasses. 
Unshielded bright hazel-green eyes with reading tired lids.
	“Wow, looks like it’s getting cold out there,” and rain starts pelting the windows. 
“The hell happened to the weather today? Just when it was looking really nice. 
What can I get for you? Something warm I’m guessing.” And she’s trying to do something about the look of disappointment on this girl’s face, this girl reeking of nicotine and trying to brush off her cold shakes. 
	“Coffee, black, big cup.” She holds herself tight, rubbing her arms for friction heat. 
The girl in front of her, behind the counter, has plain dirty blonde hair, knee length khaki shorts, knee high green striped socks and black Converse All-Stars. 
The blue hooded sweater has the sleeves rolled up and the zipper half way down. 
On the right breast is what looks like a gray smattering of ink drops. 
She has simple gold studs in her ears, and three small rings going up the crest of the lobe. 
The shirt under the sweater is grey. 
Rachael sizes her up as a small B cup. 
	Iris: (humming along to her Beatles mix which has just started Blackbird)
	Her hands move the cup under the industrial brewer and she pulls the spout, sending a cascade of coffee cup-ward, splashing on the bottom only to wave up the sides and still contained within it’s papery prison. 
She slides that caution coffee is hot hand protection slip around the diameter and a plastic lid on top, perforated on both ends to allow the proper flow of liquid during the tipping and drinking phase of consumption. 
	She hands it to the young woman across from her with her Turkish tobacco breath and slowly warming up so her arms fall off her chest revealing the ending scene of her once cold hardened nipples. 
And it’s something they can both be embarrassed about, they can pretend they’re not there, and neither of them really noticed because heaven forbid we talk about things we can’t really prevent. 
Because we can’t always be in control. 
And thunder tumble rumbles off a cloud in the distance, it would have been a twenty-seven second count if either of them saw the lightening. 
And Iris looks up from the register to hand the lady her change but she’s already seated, looking out around the café. 
Rachael doesn’t come here often at all, being usually locked up at the mission, finding volunteers from churches and youth groups, looking for funding, and all the while trying to feed a bunch of people that can’t afford it. 
She looks at the paintings and portraits on the wall, the charcoals, the watercolors, relief’s, sketches, prints and she’s thinking, damn that’s a lot of decent looking art. 
The portrait of an artist as a young man draws her attention. 
The charcoal lines and shadows, the delicate shading and broody mood of the piece.
	Rachael Vox holds a cup of coffee and hands over one dollar and sixty-five cents, she hands it over reluctantly because she’s poor. 
Because this cup of coffee will warm me up, because I’m cold, because I forgot my sweater at home like a dumbass. 
Because I need something to calm my nerves after that hideous beast of a woman at the bank. 
Because I needed to get out of the cold for a minute. 
And here I am at a table looking around at the coffee shop people, one with a laptop and headphones, one with a book, and a couple holding a hand on the surface of a table and looking into each other’s eyes, talking quietly. 
And some dude is thumbing through the notebooks standing there with his hands leafing through the pages trying to find something lined or unlined, what kind of paper and my pen might bleed through this one, and hmmm paper’s too rough, maybe just a simple college ruled and this is for notes and writings and stuff right, not sketching seriously and maybe I should just get a new pen to go with it I mean why not, ok and yes something black and slick and smooth writing something that won’t scratch the paper and rip and tear and hurt my notebook we can’t have that no no no, not at all that would be very bad, no scars for the ink to bleed no wounds except in words and no, let’s see what kind of money we’re talking about here because I really like this pen and to settle for something less could prove disaster we can’t settle we must be satisfied and that’s what matters.
	So here I am in this coffee shop, no eyes on me, I blend in, soaking up the anomnity, revealing in it, and wallowing. 
I don’t have a book or a notebook or anything but my cup and here I am, just drinking it. 
It’s still hot enough to scald my taste buds and scorch the throat on the way down, the plastic lid comes off in a bouquet of steam and scent. 
I watch the rain flick and prick and smack the windows, and tap tap tap it hits the glass and I stare at it, avoiding eye contact with anyone that wants a conversation and honestly I don’t really desire attention like that right now, just quiet in the coffee shop and I don’t want to worry, but then the door opens. 
It’s ring ding ding with the small metal bell, and the belle entering has a boy behind her holding the door open and she says “Thanks.” And she means it. 
And he smiles because he likes doing nice things for pretty girls. 
The jacket she wears and the sweater enveloping his torso are scatter splattered with drops and wet pock marks, they both wear blue jeans and sneakers. 
He wears a knit cap and a clean shaven face and she has her short, raven-black hair in pig tails. 
Her opal eyes flash on sight of the citizens and fixtures of the place, eyes the stage and looks Rachael right in the eyes and her heart skips a beat like a split second stab. 
The rings and studs in her ears, the ring in her eyebrow and what looks like a tattoo peeking out from under the left sleeve of her cream colored jacket. 
They unzip and the boy rubs his hands together blowing into them to try and make temperature adjustments, and he looks at her and says,
	“Whatcha want?” Smiling every time he looks at her.
	“Mmm, tea, green, chai tea. 
Hell yeah.” And he scratches at her back and walks to the counter while she takes a seat at the corner table. 
The girl at the counter with the stripped socks jumps off her chair and greets him excitedly and he smiles and says hello and they both look at the girl and she grins at him and he loves it. 
He places the order and I hear, “is Jolie around?” and the girl says something like “…out for a bit… try back… won’t be that long… maybe.” And he says, “cool.” And goes to sit down with the girl. 
Out of the corner of my eye, I see them lean close and talk excitedly; they play the name dropping game over musicians, especially guitar players. 
They laugh and mock each other’s tastes and find common ground and smile at each other a lot and honestly I’m jealous. 
And here I am eavesdropping in a café. 
The window takes interest again and it looks like the rain let up for a bit and hey look there’s sunlight and that means it’s my cue to get back to business. 
So I take one last look around and the boy looks at me like he knows me from somewhere but can’t quite remember and quickly gets back to the task at hand. 
	And she leaves the building wrapping her arms back around but not before extracting a cigarette and a lighter. 
She flicks a Bic and flames the end of another nail in the coffin, breathing deeply. 
Exhaling in shudders and shivers, she puts her head down and marches on down the street, on and past the cars parked and passing, the four wheeled parade of sedans and station wagons and sport utility vehicles, the meters and meter maids, parking lots and more banks and fuck that bitch, and she flicks the ash and marches on. 
There’s a trail of a tail of smoke wafting and curling around her head and she puffs away with a furrowed brow. 
And finally there’s Bailamos, which is Spanish for we dance, and she sees the mural and the side door to the office and she walks to the front double doors with heavy wood and spiraled brass handles pulling it open on the hinges, entering and she shivers in the new warmth.
	She’s standing in front of a desk of dark stained wood behind which stands a young girl of Mexican descent, her dark straight black hair and light brown skin with dark eyes, and she’s wearing a white pleated skirt and a white cardigan. 
Rachael hears her say, “table for one?” in perfect west coast English and raises an eye brow at her white Adidas sneakers. 
And Rachael says,
	“I need to speak with Maestra.”
	“Un momento senorita.” Flawless Mexico City Spanish.
	Rachael sits down crossing her legs and barely has enough time to sink into the chair when the girl previously behind the desk intones,
	“Maestra will see you now, Julio will take you.” She bows her head, sending her off through the kitchen, behind the walk-in freezer and refrigerator, past the pantry and the larder, to a simple green door and Julio knocks twice in slow succession.
	Knock.
	Knock.
	“Entre,” she says in Mexican accented French. 
Julio takes his leave, bowing out and walking backwards. 
Rachael pushes open one more door; The Skeez is in cut off shorts of denim, wearing no shoes and a sunset red-orange knit sweater from the marketplace in Rosarito. 
Reclined on a couch and smoking a joint, her dreads pulled back and tucked under a wool cap in Grateful Dead colors. 
She looks up at Rachael and
	“There you are,” and she says it dripping with affection, like a mother to a child that’s late for dinner but still so glad she’s safe. 
	“And here I am.” She sits down on the couch and sighs heavy. 
She sighs again, and “Look, so my loan was rejected today, for the exhaust hood.”
	“Really? Even with all the collateral you have to offer?” The Skeez smirks lovingly. 
She’s really getting a kick out of this.
	“That’s not funny,” she looks a bit hurt, like today hasn’t been going so well and please not right now because I hate to be a bother and I hate owing anyone anything and I still just want to strangle that bitch at the bank but here I am on your couch, again; don’t look at me like that please, not right now, and seriously this isn’t going to end well not with those eyes and I can’t I just can’t and you know that.
	“You know I’m only doing this so I can write it off as a tax deduction.” Winking still prodding because it’s ok, I’m right here and you don’t need to worry because I’ll take care of you and just seeing you makes me happy, and you know that no matter what I’ll be right here when you need me, and I mean shit man, it’s only money.
	The Skeez walks over to the safe and twirls the knobs, happy little clicks as pulls the latch sending a network of gears and mechanics into play. 
And cold steel opens to all kinds of private treasures. 
She stuffs an envelope full of money, tucks the flap in, unsealed and closes the heavy door to the safe, with all the clicks and kerchunks and everything settles. 
She reaches over to the wine rack in the alcove and finds the right vintage, that label with nothing but the year and the word Muscat. 
She hands the envelope to Rachael and tells her not to look so guilty, it’s ok. 
Rachael tells her she’ll pay her back someday, but they both know she’s lying.
	“You look pale and hungry, I’ll have the kitchen make you a little something warm, also we should drink this wine before it’s past peak.” Fetching some balloon glasses and a corkscrew. 
Thanks but really you shouldn’t, I mean there’s only so much hospitality a girl can take and these feelings of guilt even though I really could use something to eat and something to drink and this money is more than enough, but The Skeez is in the kitchen talking to Juanito who runs the food.
	Her knit cap held high she walks back in and finds a jacket to lend the poor girl for the walk home, but in her mind she wants to delay that moment as long as possible. 
A little food, a little wine and do take shelter from the cold, the rain, the dreary mission house with it’s cold rooms and that awful office with the chain smoker teeth yellow walls, with the coffee and god knows what else stained, ragged carpet. 
Can’t we just stay here for a while, forever maybe and your face is so pretty but worried and sad and what can I do, what can I do.
	“Don’t worry dear, don’t worry, I’ll take care of you for now, for a while, as long as you need me. 
I’m right here and will be.”
	She says, “Thank you,” she says “thank you so much.” And her head falls into her hands on her knees, crying, sobbing and choking on the tears. 
	“Oh dear, dear,” looking for a box of tissues or a handkerchief or something to blow her nose on and oh dear oh dear. 
There they are, she hands one over,
	“Thank you,” She looks up from her tear streaked face, bites her lip and again with “Thank you.”
	The Skeez sighs and looks on her with compassion, with tenderness, with warmth and with love. 
If she could make everything better somehow, in a moment despite the cost. 
They both look up when they hear
	Knock.
	Knock.
	The Skeez gets up, saunters to the door and takes the plate in with some silver and a napkin of deep wine red cotton. 
She lays it all on the table, right in front of her, plate’s hot, watch your fingers. 
It steams steady carrying scents and memories, cumin and cinnamon, slow braised pork, corn butter and beans, and rice. 
Overtones of lime and cilantro. 
Rachael looks at it, the smells drifting into her nostrils, setting off signals of salivation. 
It’s been a good long time since she’s had a meal that didn’t come straight from the can. 
Into and out of the goddamn microwave. 
The glasses are placed on the table with care, a corkscrew inserted into the cork, it squeaks when she twists it. 
That sound of a cork popping, that uncorking sound of release, it’s just been in place for all these years waiting for this moment. 
The wine is poured into glasses side by side to equal volumes, the color; the fruit and smell are much too complex for their smoker palettes. 
Had they been pure of tongue and trained in this delicate art of distinguishing tastes then hints of tobacco, strawberry, maple, with light floral notes and a finish that sends it all home. 
It was a damn good bottle of wine, there’s no such thing as wasting it, especially when it’s about company and sharing with someone you love. 
	Rachael picks up a fork and starts into the food in front of her while The Skeez changes the record, leafing through the vinyl library on the shelving in the alcove. 
She finds exactly what she’s looking for and she gently sets the needle into the groove. 
That thunderous guitar like bah bah bah bah bada duh then Janis starts in with her unmistakable raspy then clear and straight from the gut voice. 
The tune is Cry Baby and Rachael looks up at her with a mouthful of food like honestly, you’ve got to be kidding me; it’s not that she doesn’t love this song, it’s just timing. 
The timing is just so inappropriate. 
The Skeez is laughing and laughing herself silly, sorry I just couldn’t resist, it seemed so fitting. 
Her laughing makes Rachael crack a smile, her smile making The Skeez smile too. 
And she sits back down on the black leather couch, lifting the glass of wine to her lips and sipping it down feeling the alcohol warmth as it travels down the throat into the belly, sitting and resting until it’s digested and pissed out.
	The food is nearly all gone by now, just sauce and stray rice, the odd bean or two. 
Rachael’s stomach is full and satisfied, she leans back holding the wine glass by the stem and taking the occasional sip, feeling a bit flushed in the cheeks. 
The face of The Skeez is blushed against the natural brown of her cheeks. 
The record has long since been spinning on grooveless label, thump and scratch. 
Rachael looks at her twenty dollar department store wrist watch, noting the time and wondering if the rain has cleared up by now it must be getting late and she has a bus to catch. 
She says “Thanks,” one more time and “Thank you, so much, for everything.”
	“Don’t mention it,” waving her hand away like it’s really nothing. 
But it’s something; it’s such a wonderful something.
	“It’s about that time, I hate to say it, but yeah, I’ve got a bus to catch.”
	“Don’t worry about the bus, I’ll have Julio take you, and I won’t hear a no thanks about it, I insist, it’s ok, stop worrying so goddamn much, you’ll start going gray. 
We can’t have that happen to your pretty little head now can we.”
	“I’ll be alright.” And she’s hoping it’s true, but she doesn’t really know for certain and how could she, really.
	The Skeez brushes her hair away from her face and kisses her forehead. 
Rachael blushes a little deeper than wine alone can allow and stands up. 
Not such a bad night after all. 
The Skeez watches her walk out of her office, watches her all the way through the door until she can’t see her anymore, until the door closes and clicks into place. 
She downs the rest of the wine, pulling it right off the bottle and curls her legs to her chin on the couch, closing her eyes and hugging her knees thinking all the while stupid stupid stupid…
There is nothing terribly interesting about being a nurse. 
Nothing glamorous. 
I read somewhere or other that women typically go through a nursing phase and playing doctor and all that. 
Mostly it’s just an outlet for what the psychologists call maternal instinct. 
The drive in the mind of a woman to care for, heal, nurture and deal with people that can’t do much for themselves. 
I have noticed in my last few years, having had the time and curiosity to study the femmes around me in a way that borderlines between pure science and drunken theorizing, that many of the beautiful women I’ve encountered are going to nursing school. 
This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, and quite frankly, there’s nothing shocking about this in the least. 
The part that doesn’t make sense is this. 
This is where everything falls apart. 
In all my time in the offices of doctors, in hospitals, dentists offices, veterinarian clinics, in a million waiting rooms with uncomfortable chairs and the same selection of last year’s parenting magazines, I have not once in my life come across the beautiful nurse. 
She seems an elusive creature, hiding, lurking, possibility hibernating in the many rooms that average, uninjured people are not allowed into at hospitals. 
 I wouldn’t know. 
They never let me go through those doors. 
There’s always a chance of ending up somewhere gruesome and horrific if you wander around the hospital anyway. 
And that would be achieving the opposite of my goal. 
Worth noting is the fact that last year all the nursing students were art majors. 
Then they realized or were led to believe that there was no money to be made in the art world. 
That making a successful career in the art world involved more than starving in your romantic rat hole of an apartment, drinking cheap wine from a gallon jug and yelling at a blank canvass about the rationality of color and the complexities of crossbreeding combinations from the three primaries. 
As seems to be the case for all but the true believers, everyone drops out and ends up at nursing school or waiting tables. 
Waiting tables seems to be much like being a nurse. 
Granted that I have no experience being one or the other. 
I have on numerous occasions been on the receiving end and the treatment is quite similar. 
I should add that those lucky waitresses that make the jump up to bartender enjoy a much closer link to the role of the nurse in the lives of not quite there yet invalids. 
 A promotion measured in clear financial increase and a separate set of romantic notions. 
The trouble with all of these professions and the attitudes behind them should be fairly clear. 
In each case the nurse is not there to diagnose, to prescribe medication, to elaborate on various methods for treatment. 
The nurse is there to bring food to the patient, to administer the drug, and to clean the shit out from under the beds. 
 The nurse is not there to help aside from cleaning, feeding, and being an extra set of hands to do what the doctors tell them. 
Being a nurse means becoming intimate with every possible type of body fluid. 
Being a nurse means being jaded about the trivialities of everyday problems. 
Being a nurse means dealing with humanity on a level that is typically only shared between a mother and an infant. 
 Just as the good bartender with put her customers to sleep, just as a good waitress will see that her table orders dessert and always has something to sip on. 
Being a nurse means changing the sheets and spooning creamed nonsense into the sagging maw of some halfwit half brained charity case with vacant smoke stained eyes and scabs unscratched because the muscles just don’t move like that anymore. 
 With smiles that remain fixed on a television in the corner because the box emits light and sounds and flashes with color and excitement. 
 Sometimes they scream, sometimes they cry. 
Most times they drool and other times they piss with ruthless enthusiasm. 
Sometimes the patients smile because there’s a nurse cleaning up their excrement.
“Just like mom used to wipe my ass.”
He laughs to himself and looks back at the television. 
There are reruns on most of the networks these days. 
That’s not a matter of real concern. 
 His roommate hasn’t said a word in two weeks. 
Just about as long as they’ve been together. 
Mac was lucky, he has the window bed. 
Mac also has movement of his neck and back and most of his face is still intact and he can talk a country mile from sun up to sun down and so help you god if you try and stop his god given right to free speech and so help you god if you try to poison his food like the last nurse and so help you god if you so much as dream of switching the channel on the television because that was my show Goddamnit.
Mac leans up against an elevated bed. 
He looks down the lower half of his torso and thinks as little as possible about prostate cancer. 
 He looks at the lump under the blankets and frowns at it like a paper boy at a flat tire.
“Useless piece of shit. 
At least I’m old. 
At least this didn’t happen say, twenty years ago. 
Hey, Charlie! What was you doin’ say, twenty years ago?”
The other man in the room lies flat in his bed. 
His face has been hung over for the last few years. 
Eyelids just past half way to closed, slack jawed yellow skin neck fat jowls flabby with gravity towards the center of the earth. 
Making a path for lazy mouth moisture to accumulate and drip into an accepting pillow. 
Charlie isn’t technically in a coma. 
That doctor with the Polish name, ends with an i or something along those lines. 
He said it wasn’t technically a coma, but all the symptoms were there. 
Whatever that means. 
Not technically. 
Some doctor. 
All he does all day is wander into rooms with a clipboard, ask the nurse some question and then disappear. 
 How many years of schooling and thousands of dollars for a top notch education, to land a job as clipboard courier. 
 All he has to offer Charlie is a place to sleep if you could call it that. 
All he has to offer are morphine shots and a few meals a day. 
Hydration and synthetic sustenance.
“Twenty years ago, hell. 
Give me back the eighties. 
Give me back the functional decadence of two decades ago. 
That was a time. 
Hoo boy. 
The women with all that hair! All that hair! Came out of their heads like hedges and down to legs in miniskirts and high heels. 
There was a time me and Mark Suthers were in this place ‘round North Beach. 
Been up all night and day doing glorious lines of coke in the back of Mark’s Fiat. 
Ended up in this dive with a few good taps and godawful juke box. 
Always sounded like some kind of faggot dance music bullshit. 
But this doll walks in. 
And believe me, she would have broken your neck from whiplash. 
She walked into that place like Cleopatra descending on Rome. 
All cackling bracelets and long legs that you could climb to heaven on. 
Had a face like a frozen pond on a moonless night. 
Breathtaking. 
Absolutely. 
Mark gets it into his head to make a pass and he’s all fumblefuck for words. 
She gives him a long looking over and laughs at him like good mother when her child displays a drawing that could be a bear or a dog or a dinosaur. 
He slumps back over to the bar and me and the barkeep and takes his beer, near full beer in one of those nice glasses, and throws the fucker clear to the other side of the room. 
Had to drag his ass out of there find us a quite place to get a cup of coffee right quick. 
He was shit for driving at that point and I was catching up to him. 
 I got him to the diner and get some coffee under his nose for a change and he looks right up at me and says,
‘Now Mac, why you gotta ruin a good night like that?’
“Well, I damn near shit myself. 
I explained the situation to him a thousand times and he insisted she was about to come home with him. 
I asked if he got her name or number or anything and he just looks at me and says,
‘Why you gotta ruin a good night like that?’
“Twenty years ago, hell.” Mac looks out the window, watching the wheel chaired patients getting pushed around by apathetic nurses and slightly less enthusiastic relatives. 
A young girl in a white coat enters the room and says something like,
“Good afternoon Mister Daltry. 
How is everything today?”
“How the fuck do you think everything is? I’m still here ain’t I?”
“Indeed you are Mister Daltry. 
Indeed you are.” The girl in the coat checks the clipboards at the foot of each bed. 
She writes a few new words in. 
She looks over the two men and notes their present condition. 
“Is there anything I can do for you while I’m here?” She asks.
“Would you be so kind as to fetch me some cold beer and a pack of cigarettes? Maybe a nice roast beef sandwich and also, if it’s not too much trouble, suck my cock? I don’t want to be a burden or anything.”
“I see your sense of humor is still intact Mister Daltry. 
That’s excellent news. 
I’ll ask the doctor if there’s anything he’d be willing to provide for you. 
In the meantime, I suggest getting plenty of rest.”
“Right. 
Rest up. 
Big day tomorrow. 
All that bullshit. 
What has rest ever given me, really? What do I need to recharge for? Get all energetic and healthy so I can die on my feet?”
“Now, now Mister Daltry, let’s not get too excited. 
How has Mister Finn been? Any changes?”
“Charlie? Nope. 
Charlie just lies there, drooling at me. 
Same as yesterday. 
Same as tomorrow. 
Same as next week and next month and next year if he makes it that long. 
Charlie ain’t moved nor said nothing as long as I been here. 
Makes a great listener though.”
“That’s nice Mister Daltry. 
I’ll send someone up with a meal in a little while.” The nurse leaves the room and leaves behind two beds with two old men and a longwinded one sided conversation.
“Hoo-fucking-ray for meal time.” Mac looks out the window. 
The people in the wheel chairs don’t seem to be reacting much to being outside. 
As if the whole idea of being wheeled around the garden for a while is for the benefit of the nurses. 
Give them time to smell the roses. 
Let them get out of the stagnant stale breadbox hospital rooms, the long hallways with acoustics built for sharp sounding shoes marching towards inevitable disappointment.
“God, if I ever end up in one of those damn chairs I hope someone has the common courtesy to push me down a flight of stairs.”
Mac returns his attention to the television and refuses to change the channel. 
The remote has been lost all week and he will never admit this to anyone.
The nurse closes the door and takes a heavy intake of breath. 
She holds the air in for a second or two and lets her lungs empty slowly. 
She lets her shoulders sag and slumps her back and releases a stale hospital sigh, drained of the vital molecules, back to the air ducts for another round against the filters and conditioners.
She pads along the corridor in simple black flats, made for spending eight hours on your feet, made cheap and disposable in case they are doused with some leaking bag, be it a body or bacteria. 
The nurse walks along with the clipboard held close to her chest and looking not quite down, but not straight ahead. 
The air smells like sanitizer and stray coughs that wandered out of the mouths of children, slowing dying of emphysema due to a few years living above a busy street
Behind the reception desk is the gateway to the break room. 
There’s a coffee pot and a water cooler. 
A small refrigerator for staff to keep food in. 
A table that discourages lingering and chairs to match. 
Despite the chairs, or in spite of, the receptionist has been on extended lunch break. 
The phone jockey twirls cold spaghetti in a plastic container meant for leftovers and the transportation of lunch. 
The noodles spin on a fork absentmindedly. 
“Big day for breeders.” The receptionist says.
“Excuse me?” The nurse replies.
“The maternity ward? It’s poppin’ in there. 
Must have been twenty kids in the last twelve hours. 
I’d bet there was a power outage nine months ago. 
Goddamn blackout babies.” The receptionist receives a mouth full of noodles and lets her teeth do all the work.
“Yeah, well. 
This is a hospital.” The nurse pours herself a cup of coffee into a white ceramic mug. 
She takes a sip and the bitterness of burnt beans—overly roasted coffee—overwhelms. 
She shivers taking in a petite sip of still too hot to drink, still too burnt to enjoy coffee. 
She holds the mug in her hands, letting the coldness of her fingers thaw, wrapped around the mug in temperature contrast.
“Damn right this is a hospital. 
Can’t really forget this is a hospital. 
The smell, the sounds, the phones, the phones, the phones. 
Everyone rushing around from room to room, delaying death and making everyone sign forms about it. 
God. 
Hospital, indeed. 
I should have got a job at a massage parlor.” The receptionist takes another bite, lazily flicking noodles around her mouth, masticating starchy strips of boiled flour and egg.
“You’re still young. 
You could get a job anywhere answering phones. 
Not like you spent the last three years going to school for it.”
“Yeah, I guess. 
But I’m so settled here. 
It took me days to learn everyone’s names. 
I don’t want to go through with that all over again just yet. 
Besides… Benefits and whatnot.”
“Mmm…hmm.” The nurse tries again at the coffee, hoping to get something more for her efforts, hoping that waiting will pay off. 
The temperate has dropped to acceptable levels, but the bitterness lingers.
“Say, tell me. 
What made you want to get into nursing anyway? You’re pretty enough to get a job somewhere else. 
Hell, with a body like yours you could have been a dancer or something.”
“Dancing? Seriously? Oh, no. 
No, no. 
I can’t dance for shit. 
Let alone money. 
No. 
But, well, the nursing thing just kind of happened. 
I was at college for whatever, undergrad stuff, fluff classes. 
Just killing time and lost in the drift of now what. 
The nursing program caught my eye. 
Year and a half more of classes, and viola, I have a career. 
Almost guaranteed. 
Right out of school. 
Everyone needs nurses, I guess.”
“So it was kinda a fool proof path to getting your loans paid off?”
“Well, yeah. 
Loans and bills and rent and you know, benefits…”
“Yeah, benefits.” The receptionist stabs at the noodles, propping her head up with and arm resting on the table.
“I always seem to get the old men.”
“No shortage of those right now.”
“Tell me about it. 
Always the same. 
Vulgar comments and stares. 
Can’t stand it. 
They give me the chills.”
“What would you prefer? Dealing with babies or burn victims?”
“God. 
I don’t know. 
I think I’d take the ER over watching a bunch of dirty old men dying slowly. 
At least there’s something always going on in the ER. 
I wouldn’t have time to think so much.”
“Thinking’s a bitch. 
Never gets you anywhere.”
“Tell me about it.” The nurse finishes her burnt coffee and leaves the mug in the sink, the last few drops evaporating into a brown ring at the bottom.
“Well, back to the rounds. 
Don’t work too hard.” And she’s gone.
“Mmm.” The receptionist pokes at stray, broken noodles. 
Too short to twirl, too long to throw away. 
Not just yet.
The narrator invites you to a small community park. 
The kind with picnic benches and a swing set. 
The kind of park with a basketball hoop and concrete in all the right places. 
The kind of place where you expect to find children playing tag, or running around being children. 
There’s a river nearby. 
The kind of river that is dammed in the summer in order to allow the kids a deep enough place to swim. 
On the basketball court are a young boy and a young girl. 
They have been playing a game. 
The boy is providing running commentary. 
“Dermit takes control of the ball; he makes a line drive for the hoop, takes the open shot!” The boy throws the ball and watches as it bounces off the backboard and on to the concrete.
“Oh! So Close! The score remains four to two, Dermit leading by two in the third quarter.” The boy stands on one end of the court, waiting. 
“Possession of the ball goes to Russie. 
Russie eyes the defense and seems to be planning an attack.” The girl dribbles the ball in place and eyes the boy crossly.
“Do you really have to announce everything I’m doing?” She shifts her nose and mouth in opposite directions and furrows her brow.
“C’mon Russie, the clock’s ticking we have to be home before it gets dark.” He spits with acquired machismo on the concrete court.
The girl continues bouncing the ball back and forth between her hands. 
She pulls forward and dashes straight at the boy. 
She lunges at him with enough speed to stall the commentary. 
A moment before contact she spins around him in a dance move suggesting her own elusiveness. 
She hurls the ball up and out and into the net.
“Three points for Russie! The score is now five to four, Russie leading and only ten minutes left!” The girl gives her account of the game as the boy stands rooted in disbelief, jaw slack then tight in an air of stubborn renewal.
“Dermit has the ball.” He says to himself, standing under the net. 
He bounces the ball three times in a personal ritual of determination. 
He looks up to see the girl standing with arms and legs at the ready, awaiting the moment to block his shot. 
He starts off at a slow pace, marching in a weave trying to weaken her powers of anticipation. 
 Her eyes follow his movements and her body bounces along with the ball from side to side. 
She makes a charge, fakes to the left, hands to the right and snatches the ball mid bounce from the boy’s control. 
She breaks away and takes a clean shot off the rebound and into the net.
“Another for Russie! She now leads by three. 
Seven minutes left on the clock and the ball goes back to Dermit.” She smiles her way back to the other end of the court, taking it at a brisk jog. 
A breeze picks up and the evening is perched on a branch above, waiting to swoop down and swallow the sun when the day comes up to the surface to have dinner. 
 She shivers slightly and brushes her hair out of her face.
“We don’t have all day Dermit! Clock’s ticking!” She laughs at him and his frustration.
“Dermit has the ball.” He reassures himself. 
He makes three bounces in rhythmic fashion. 
The springs of his legs burst forward, propelling him half the length of the court. 
He stops at the center and lunges, ejecting the ball towards the hoop with the full force of his body. 
The only sound is cloth on rubber; the delicate penetration of three points passing right through the net. 
He lets out a small cry of victory. 
“What a play! Dermit ties the game with only five minutes left! The level of excitement is almost overwhelming. 
The crowd is going crazy!” The boy runs a victory lap around the court making all the sounds so his audience doesn’t have to.
The girl takes the ball and walks back underneath the hoop. 
She bounces the ball in place with one hand and looks at the opposite side of the court. 
The boy is grinning now, victory seemingly within his grasp. 
The sun hits the horizon and seems to speed up time. 
The permeating dimness of dusk; the sudden chill brought on by the blocked rays of heat. 
And then the sun sinks out of sight.
“Aww man! We can’t end with a tie game. 
Hurry up and play, we still have enough time for one more.”
The girl doesn’t answer. 
She stares at the other end of the court. 
She stares ahead and right through the boy. 
“If I make this shot,” she thinks, “then I win. 
If I miss, then he’ll get the rebound and he’ll win.” She stands in place, bouncing the ball in the same spot, devoid of expression. 
“If I make this shot, then I win…” She bounces the ball again.
“C’mon Russie! If you don’t hurry then my mom will get mad at me again!”
She doesn’t hear anything except the breeze as it gains courage and strength, enough to rustle the leaves and wave a few flags. 
 “What happens if I win?” She continues thinking, barely feeling as the ball glides from her hand to the ground and back again. 
“What do I win, exactly? Is there a prize of some kind? Would victory really mean anything?”
“The ball’s in your court, Russie! What are you going to do with it? It’s either win or lose right now! The ball’s in your court, time’s running out! You better make a move!” The boy tries to goad her on. 
He stands at the other end of the court with his hands on his knees and his eyes on the ball.
“The ball’s in my court… What happens if I don’t make a move? Will the game be suspended on account of inactivity? Will victory go nowhere? The ball’s in my court. 
Win or lose. 
Make a move.” She continues bouncing the ball and watching the leaves being unbuttoned from the trees as the breeze blows them apart. 
She bites her lower lip and looks at the ground. 
“Come on! I have to go home soon! I can’t wait all night for you to do something! Mom is going to kill me if I’m late for dinner again.” He kicks at a leaf lying dead on the concrete.
“What happens if I lose? Will I be doomed to live in shame? Will I be forever cursed? Will I be a loser? Am I establishing patterns that will only repeat themselves as I grow older and the consequences become more critical? Will he lord his victory over me and think of me as some kind of conquered goal? Would beating me in a game of basketball give him the right to think less of me? To condescend to me? Would I have proven myself inadequate to the world at large? What does it really mean to lose? What have I lost, really?” The ball stops bouncing. 
She holds it in both hands and presses it to her chest. 
“The ball’s in my court. 
My turn to make a move. 
Win or lose. 
Can’t we just stay tied? Can’t we just be equals and go home happy? Does it always have to end up like this? What’s the point if one of us always ends up losing? Isn’t there enough loss already? Do we really need to act it out in a game? But, the ball’s in my court…” She trails off in her thoughts and looks up at the sky growing dark and breeze becoming a wind, knocking the soft hairs of her arms into attention atop goose pimple hills where they wave like little flags.
“Hey! Russie! Ruuussie! Hey! You still there? We have to get back, it’s getting too dark. 
My mom’s probably already mad at me.” He gives her a stern look and notices that her eyes have welled up. 
He notices her cheeks are wet and she’s shivering in the wind and her eyes are far away from the park. 
“Hey… Russie, c’mon. 
Let’s go home. 
It was a good game.”
The boy puts a hand on her shoulder. 
The touch snaps her back to the present. 
She drops the ball and watches as it bounces lower each time and rolls away from her. 
Her eyes follow the ball until it stops moving. 
The boy leaves his hand on her shoulder. 
“Hey, let’s go home, alright?”
She nods. 
The boy walks over to a bench and picks up their coats, putting his on as he walks back to the girl with hers in his hand. 
She puts on her coat and buttons it all the way up the neck. 
She’s still shivering. 
The boy picks up the ball and looks for a second at the net. 
He tucks the ball under his arm and the two of them walk home.
The wind softens to a breeze again and the last bit of sunlight turns into street lamps and neon signs. 
Into headlights and stop lights and the into the kind of light bulbs people use for illuminating the dining room in order that the mothers of young children can wait for them to get home while the food slowly becomes cool in a softly lit place.
There’s something to be said about dining alone. 
The art and science of it. 
Especially in a big city with the world at your feet and options everywhere. 
Selection is the first crucial step. 
If you happen to own a car like the bourgeoisie asshole that you are, abandon the heap as soon as possible, maybe with a free to a good home sign on the windshield and the keys sitting on the front seat. 
Now that you’re a little alleviated, pick a street and start walking. 
Walk until you come to an intersection with as many options as possible. 
Pick a direction that looks laden with restaurants. 
When the mattress stores and furniture outlets pan out and the mechanics have faded into the background of the urban mishmash the glow of neon signs will bloom over the gateways to fine cuisine. 
If you have any preference about ethnicity or cultural settings for your dining experience, now is the time to keep that in mind. 
You will be distracted by convenience, proximity and attractive front window displays. 
Don’t be deceived. 
Keep the original intent in mind. 
This is important for dining alone properly.
My problem was of a calendar nature. 
It was a Sunday after Christmas. 
I had been walking for the better part of an hour with hunger welling up to my neck and the coffee and cigarettes throughout the day beginning to take their toll on me. 
I had had it in my head since waking that I wanted to eat some Chinese for the first time in months. 
Chinese food sounded so exotic and in contrast to my usual diet of work scraps and dollar store noodles with canned tomato sauce or three days boiling chicken soup. 
The appeal was over whelming. 
I was forced into action.
Around the job there was talk of a fantastic Chinese place up in Albany called China Village. 
But Albany is at least a Bart ride away. 
I had around sixty cent left on my last rail card and figured that now was not the time for a little northbound trek only for the sake of a meal. 
That’s a bit much for the budget. 
Oddly, the only person in the kitchen with no comment on China Village was the young, recently married, Chinese girl that worked next to me. 
She was the pastry chef and seemed to have something to say about everything else. 
She looked at me yesterday and said,
“Nick, you’re like the Eeyore of the kitchen. 
Poor sad and lonely Nick. 
You’re so fucking depressing.”
Was I really that depressing? I mean, I never had much to say and lived for the most part in my head at work. 
But I never thought of myself as being depressing or a depressed kind of person. 
Thinking always about other things, day dreaming, stuck with a song or focused on cutting some vegetable or other. 
But depressed? Really? The comment came out of her mouth like child that’s been let out of the orthodontists, brace-less and facing the world with a set of shiny incisors for the first time since the forced exit from the chute between her mother’s legs. 
I mulled that incident over again in my head for the twentieth time that evening. 
I mean, introspective is certainly applicable. 
Quiet, sure. 
Her words left me self-centered and conflicted. 
A little hurt. 
And that may have made me depressed. 
I’d prefer tragic. 
I think I told her I was never alone as long as there was whiskey involved. 
I dig my own holes, I guess. 
And instead of climbing out, I’ll break the shovel and keep on until there’s dirt caked underneath my nails and soil stains on my hands and clothing.
Before leaving to find a place of refreshment, I did a little research to find a restaurant that would be suitable and close enough to walk to. 
The computer read off a list that centered on University and Shattuck—generally a failsafe destination for the famished—and I got moving. 
From Telegraph there are numerous options for a footpath to the food court on the strip mall section of upper Shattuck. 
The path is generally a kind of North West route that can either be colorful with all the signs of commerce or promises of higher education or mostly quiet suburban blocks with quaint sidewalks and street lights in front of clusters of housing units commonly known as neighborhoods. 
It was a decent night for the more urban of routes, main streets with not exactly heavy traffic, but not what you might call dead. 
The asphalt arteries carried enough sedans and sport utility cells to keep the beast breathing. 
 It was a three cigarette meander down the road. 
That’s about how long it took.
I was looking for a place called King Dong. 
I confess that the name did catch my attention. 
If there’s any reason I love the Chinese dialects I’d have to say that the lost in translation misinterpretation of the symbols tends to come up with more than a few words that could be construed as innuendo to my overly sexually stimulated mind. 
The name King Dong conjured up sun kings, sun gods, fertility worship, a million people prostrate in front of a phallus of royal proportions. 
If someone told me to eat a dick, I’d go straight to King Dong for a few bites of egg rolls. 
Unfortunately, I didn’t remember more than the street name. 
Details like actually address failed me. 
Shattuck stretches on for miles in a few directions. 
I could end up in Oakland one way or Albany in the other. 
I decided to leave fate to go fuck it’s self and went in the opposite direction of home. 
I’d settle on the first decent looking Chinese place I laid eyes on. 
It took a few blocks and a few side streets. 
One place was too crowded, another too large and empty. 
But there was a street with two Chinese places on opposite sides of the street. 
I figured competition would be high between them and quality would increase. 
I felt safe here. 
I walk up a place called May Flower, wondering what the hell a ship of fools had to do with Chinese food. 
No matter. 
 The place was small and silent. 
I was the only one in the building aside from a cook and a man I could only assume was the owner. 
This seemed like one of those family affairs.
He looks up as the door makes a racket behind me, cutting off the December chill that tried to follow me in. 
He’s in no hurry to seat me. 
And I stand in expectation in the middle of the restaurant dining room. 
Your move old man. 
Should I seat myself, or would you like the honor of directing my ass to a chair of your preference? I would just like to sit down, take off my coat and hat and get my hands around a hot cup of tea
A note about Chinese restaurants. 
I’ve always had an aversion to the places that set table without chopsticks. 
There’s an inherent barbarous quality to western silverware, the need to cut and stab at the food before eating. 
 I’m pretty sure that Confucius had something to say about that. 
It might have something to do with the reason behind using chopsticks either as a genesis or an afterthought. 
I can’t remember these things. 
Too many details. 
But, the point is, the places that don’t set table with chopsticks are either pandering to the fumble fingers of the western hand or they seem to doubt their own authenticity, or perhaps it’s a gesture of condescending nature. 
 As if anyone that walks in would be able to wield the chopsticks. 
And either way, something about that disturbs me.
This was not a restaurant with chopsticks at the table. 
Just a napkin and a fork. 
Just a place mat concealing the placemat underneath the glass on the table top with a print of the Chinese zodiac on it. 
I read that I was born in the year of the rat. 
The rest of the description is lost on me. 
As far as the Chinese are concerned, I’m a rat. 
I can never win with them. 
At least with the western zodiac I’m a goat. 
Either way, according to the stars, I belong with the trash. 
But I guess we have a saying about trash and treasure so all is not lost. 
I find that it’s important to carry at least one book with me always. 
When dining alone, the necessity is most certainly there. 
The idea is to give the appearance of not being alone because that was your only option tonight, but rather you needed some space between all your engagements to grab a bite to eat and relax with a good book. 
After what seems a good five minutes of me looking the menu over and the man behind the counter polishing glasses or counting something, he comes back around and to take my order. 
 I could use some spring rolls and pot stickers and tea to start and some house special pork. 
There is no further description. 
There’s pork in it and that’s enough for me. 
He asks me if I’d like some rice in a way that makes me think I’d be a fool not to. 
I agree to the rice and continue reading.
In the book, a young Italian sheepherder is having dinner with some aristocratic family for the first and only time during his employ. 
The story is told from the perspective of the youngest boy in the family, being fairly close to the age of the sheepherder. 
He describes the details of his awkward family and the class differences separating them and how the whole show is painfully awkward and ritualistic. 
The story makes me glad that I am alone in a Chinese restaurant that doesn’t offer me chopsticks upon arrival with a book about eating with someone else’s family in a country I have never been to.
The egg rolls arrive almost too hot to eat and tea that has yet to steep properly. 
I take an eggroll and dip into a sauce of an almost absurdly red nature, a kind of too bright to be natural, goopy, slime of a sauce that coats the eggrolls like a layer of ruby silicone gel. 
I’m too hungry to care about aesthetics and care only for getting some kind of sustenance into my empty since noon belly. 
After the first one is down the hatch I turn my attention back to the book and read while absentmindedly eating the rest of fried to a golden brown cylinders stuffed with something that only the cook knows about. 
A couple walks in. 
When I say a couple your mind might jump to images of a man and woman. 
You might have ideas about how old they are before I can lay the details on you. 
I couldn’t tell if the pair was composed of two men or a man and a very ugly woman. 
One sounded slightly feminine, but not enough to persuade me to a definite conclusion. 
I’d peg their ages around early fifties to late forties. 
They walk straight up to the counter and make a to-go order without looking at the menu. 
They then sat in semi-silence while waiting for a bag full of boxes to be bestowed upon them. 
I ate and read. 
Then the pot stickers showed up.
The old man put down the plate on the table and walked away. 
I said thank you and pushed the plate into position, waiting until the eggrolls were consumed before moving on. 
The pot stickers held a hard sear on one side. 
They were plump pockets of dough stuffed once again, with something indistinguishable. 
The sauce was a kind of translucent black goo this time. 
Not as sweet as the last one, more salty, maybe soy based with hints of something or other. 
I continued eating and reading. 
By this time, the tea has steeped properly and the color was getting darker by the pour. 
I was up to three cups and the last one finished bitterly. 
Around this time a woman walked in from somewhere in the back. 
After a few minutes her relationship to the restaurant was obvious. 
She was the owner’s wife. 
 She bickers at the man behind the counter; at least I assume it was bickering. 
 She was speaking a language I’m not at all familiar with, but the bickering pattern is one I know well enough. 
She talked a lot and quickly, he responded sparsely with one or two word replies. 
The old man brought me the pork and I never saw him again.
The woman fixed a smile on her face when she saw me and immediately made sure my water glass never came close to empty. 
She checked my tea and rice to see if I needed more. 
She put music on the stereo and began straightening tables that no one had sat at for weeks. 
She was either counting something behind the counter, or adjusting napkins, aligning the forks and napkins, or putting the tea cups in their place. 
She must be a mother, I thought. 
She even offered me a pair of chopsticks.
She refilled everything before I could get in a word about how much more intake I could deal with. 
I made the universal gesture for being full—rubbing my hand on my stomach and exhaling through pursed lips. 
She asked if I would like a box to the remains in and I said yes, thank you. 
 What was left of my meal appears much smaller when condensed to a traveling container. 
She says thank you, good night at least twice. 
She may have been sad to see me go. 
I was the only customer that sat down to eat all night. 
She may have needed someone to dote on while her husband was condemned to the back room to deal with the paper work. 
  
I received two fortune cookies along with my bill. 
One told me of the onset of a new romantic interlude. 
On the back were instructions for learning simple Chinese words. 
On the back of this fortune was the Chinese word for ‘No’. 
Outside again and with a full belly that will benefit greatly from the long walk home and a mind that has been grateful for an evening out, dining alone. 
The cioppino was a mistake. 
You’d think in a small, port town with a name like Port Townsend, the seafood would be nothing short of transcendent. 
If transcendence can be found in a motel room full of stomach cramps, bloating, and the rank toiling trouble burbling down below my belt, I must have missed it. 
I’ve only seen my father cry twice. 
Both times at funerals. 
This time --number three-- he was on the phone to my Aunt Karen, who was also crying. 
The death of my uncle was expected. 
We knew about it. 
He was supposed to have another month or two. 
The service is tomorrow and my father has to read psalm 23 at mass. 
At Our Lady of the Sea. 
At a church in Port Townsend, Washington on the 22nd of October, 2009. 
A Thursday.
My guts hate me right now. 
My guts have filed no less than three written complaints, all notarized and signed in triplicate. 
All this sitting around in the car. 
I should have walked to Washington. 
My parents are sleeping in the same motel room. 
It’s their 31st wedding anniversary. 
Their anniversary will be marked, from now on, by the absence of my uncle. 
Mother is watching a documentary on the queen of England. 
Father’s reading the bible from the drawer where they keep bibles in motel rooms. 
I don’t know why he’s reading it. 
I don’t think he knows either.
Uncle Larry was a big man with a big laugh and a moustache that he must have been born with. 
His ashes are to be scattered on the trails he blazed in the Pacific Northwest. 
 He forged the Olympic trails with the Sierra Club crew. 
He picked up trash on the highways around Port Ludlow where he lived for the last few years. 
Someone gave him an orange vest, like the community service workers. 
Something to spare him from the winding road traffic in small town Washington.
This is the last night with my folks up here in the eternal fog of northwestern edge of the United States. 
I’m not counting Alaska for practical reasons. 
I wouldn’t count Alaska as more than a defense post just in case Russia ever tries to make a comeback. 
My folks have passed out in the bed next to mine. 
A long day for them and a curfew of ten o’clock. 
I have a little reading light to write by. 
I have a few more pages of notebook to get whatever I can down before I can sleep.
The church is high up on the hill in Port Townsend. 
Up a few roads, past the lighthouse that doesn’t have a light anymore, past the fire station which would have more trouble trying to start a fire in this ever present dampness. 
We’re a half hour early, which is normal for my folks; abnormal for me. 
There’s a preacher and an altar boy, they read some things. 
I just look up at big dead statue Jesus on the cross. 
Big statue Jesus with his hands frozen in blessing. 
Big statuesque Mary holding statue baby Jesus. 
Frozen in infanthood.
I can see the ferry pulling up to the dock in Bremerton. 
I have a complimentary cup of coffee thanks to a Keurig promotional event at the dock. 
This is a coffee place. 
The weather is all about coffee. 
Strong, hot black coffee. 
Anything to keep warm. 
Anything to stay dry.
There was a piper at the wake. 
If not for the piper, I wouldn’t have felt much of anything. 
My uncle is all ashes in a can. 
Could even be one of those cans that nice Scotches come in. 
My aunt is wearing a tartan shawl, hugging and holding everyone in sight. 
My father gets up to read psalm 23, each verse punctuated by a response from the crowd. 
The people are mostly old folks, his sisters from Indiana. 
My aunt’s brother Don, his two daughters. 
Representatives from the Scottish American Military are here in their kilts, sporrans and hats.
My father and I drink single malt in honor of my uncle. 
We’re at a place called Sirens. 
A siren, aside from the blaring ruckus emanating from emergency vehicles, is a vocalist that lures wayward sailors to their deaths. 
Typically by dashing their ships against the rocks. 
Usually a death by bludgeoning followed by drowning. 
We drink it neat. 
We avoid the rocks. 
Tepid Scotch on a chilly day. 
There was something like rain on the walk over here. 
Enough to soak our hats and jackets. 
Our spirits are being nourished by other spirits. 
There’s a fireplace in the corner. 
The fire just far enough away that it’s only good for the flame. 
The warmth long since dissipated before stretching long fiery fingers in our direction.
The piper plays Amazing Grace. 
Mother dabs her eyes with a tissue and passes it to my father. 
Fred Willard guest stars as the priest. 
Sounds like him, looks like him. 
The priest won’t shut up about how my uncle was at peace because of god. 
That because of god, my uncle had no regrets, no enemies, no wants or desires. 
The priest says the word god at least sixty times in his eulogy. 
I’d rather hear about how he’d sit his grandson, Gio, on his lap, tell him stories until he slept like the toddler he is. 
How my uncle cussed out some guy on a rafting trip down the Colorado River once. 
How my uncle would have rather been outside today. 
Up on a hill somewhere, looking down at the Puget Sound. 
The ashes are to be scattered along the Olympic trail in the spring. 
A large Scotsman, thick as an accent, eyebrows big enough to hang a Sunday hat on, sings The Flowers of Scotland. 
Another man steps up to the mic, harmonica in hand, plays You Take the High Road, can’t even make it through the song. 
His voice cracks, my aunt sobs and shakes and wipes her eyes. 
Another of the Scottish American Military steps up and tells how my uncle did him a favor once. 
Stood as color guard when his father died. 
Lent him his sporran. 
My uncle would give up the skin on his back if you were cold. 
I am on a boat. 
A ferry, really. 
Upper deck, back right. 
Same place I’d sit if this were a bus. 
The captain sounds much too chipper. 
For some reason that worries me. 
I don’t expect anyone to be chipper at 9am. 
Even on a Friday. 
I have an hour on the boat before hitting ground again. 
2 hours to myself right after landing. 
Might go busking. 
Might do something. 
Nowhere to smoke. 
Washington is not a smoke friendly place. 
Here is something I can’t understand. 
Rain and fog and cloudy weather are the most delightful and rewarding conditions to smoke in.
My uncle died of cancer. 
Starting in his lungs. 
Which is par for the course, I suppose. 
All my grandparents died the same way. 
Even though my uncle wasn’t blood, it just seems like the way my family did, and will die. 
My cousins are here, we haven’t seen each other in years. 
Tony is in a sober living home until February or so. 
Rose is a dispatch operator for the police. 
Her eyes are too far apart on her face. 
She must have amazing peripheral vision. 
Like a fish. 
Tony is built like he’s half Italian, half Scottish. 
Like a bulldog. 
He’s wearing long sleeves to hide his tattoos. 
He’s been doing hard time for most of my adult life. 
Something about meth. 
His son is the youngest member of the family.
It smells like popcorn on the ferry. 
I’m full of eggs and potatoes from breakfast with my god brother. 
He’s in the navy and his name is David. 
Billy Joel wrote a line about him in the song that ruined his career. 
I haven’t seen David since his wedding two years ago. 
I was one of those people opposed to him joining the service. 
At least he’s just pushing paper instead of pulling triggers. 
His wife is young and in college. 
They get to see each other for a few hours a day on good days. 
Then he ships out and lives on a submarine for a while. 
Cruising underwater around the pacific, doing things he’s not allowed to talk about. 
This makes conversation a cobweb of small talk with little dead flies of anecdotes every once in a while. 
He’s not terribly interested in anything I’ve been up to. 
We went in opposite directions after high school. 
Puget Sound is beautiful. 
The autumnal assault of colored trees mixing with the evergreens on the hillsides. 
Always rain coming down. 
The sea breeze blowing and the ferry chugs along.
After the wake, when all the friends have gone, the family goes out to dinner. 
Some place called the Port Ludlow Resort. 
Some place called The Fireside. 
There are ten of us. 
Aunt Karen, father, mother, Rose, Tony, the sisters Anne, Theresa, Catherine and Beth. 
Oh, I’m here too. 
I have little to say right now. 
My father and I are drinking single malt again. 
The rest are telling stories about Larry as a boy, Larry as a young man, Larry as a father and husband. 
The man was a doer. 
He did. 
If a thing was out of place, he’d right it. 
If something didn’t belong, he removed it. 
He fixed, polished, cleaned, and organized. 
He was a smiling moustache, a laughter that filled time and space. 
A man now gone. 
I always remember him smiling. 
Always with a story. 
If you told him that everything had already been done before, he’d say “then let’s do it again!” He believed in adventure. 
In getting outside. 
Moving, always. 
Outdoors as often as possible. 
He loved life and was on a mission to get the most out of it. 
There never was a kinder, gentler man. 
A man more at peace. 
A man full to bursting with love and good nature.
The ferry landed with a thud and a shudder. 
Everyone filed out of the boat and walked out into the rain and cold wind. 
I flick ashes on the dock in Seattle. 
I inhale and absorb my surroundings. 
The skyscrapers, the low clouds, the smell of fish and salt water. 
A row of gift shops all selling shot glasses and shirts with Seattle written all over them. 
I wrap a scarf around my neck; pull my hat on tight, button all my buttons and take a long slow drag at my second to last cigarette. 
A few months from now, my uncle will be in the soil. 
The soil with sprout a bush or a flower, a shrub or a tree. 
Bits of my uncle will turn green and become leaves, roots, stems, stalks and petals. 
I can’t imagine him wanting anything else. 
To be earth. 
To be ash. 
To fuel the cycle. 
To keep things going. 
 His moustache mingling with the pollen and the pine nettles up on a mountain somewhere in Washington. 
A laugh can’t be incinerated. 
His was the kind that wouldn’t fit in the chamber anyway. 
Instead it’s going to blow around the Olympic trail riding on the cold winds of northern Washington. 
His laugh is going to dance with the fog horns and fishing boats, mingle with the hikers and bikers and trailblazers that pick up where he left off. 
His laugh will fill the sails and push the leaves, lingering on everything he left behind. 
Leaving everything a little lighter in his wake.
Sandcastles
I vividly remember the day her handwriting changed. 
By coincidence it was the same day I'd grown tired of listening to the upstairs neighbors fucking. 
Typically I'd home and they'd be at it. 
I'd be tired and drunk and lie in bed. 
Listening to the squeaks groans from upstairs. 
This happened twice a day. 
The only times that I was ever home. 
Namely before I slept and after I woke up.
I woke on this particular morning to rain but not the sound. 
Not the pleasant ambiance. 
But the harsh reality of a broken umbrella and the down pour waiting outside the front door. 
It had been a sickly morning. 
Starting around seven when I started coughing and ending around one when I was scheduled to rise and go to work. 
I went to lock the door and found most my key still inside the door knob. 
Broken off the night before.
I called on the landlord who always seemed to be around anyway. 
He seemed the lazy son of a well to do family. 
No goals, no ambitions. 
So his family--who I imagine had some money--set him up with an apartment building. 
All he had to do was live there and fix broken keys and make sure everyone paid rent.
I knocked on his door and he answered slightly unsure of whom I was and reluctant because he knew which apartment I lived in. 
He motioned for his handyman to help me and they talked out of earshot in a language I didn’t know. 
Forty-five minutes later the handy man came over to look at my door and pry the broken half of the key out. 
It was then I decided to check the mail. 
As I hoped, she had sent a letter. 
The return address was the same as always. 
But the writing was different. 
I figured maybe she had to dictate it or maybe she had injured herself. 
I had written her faithfully for sometime and it had been a few months since she responded. 
I had been checking the mail in hopes of a letter from her for a long time. 
Even on Sundays when I know the mail was not delivered. 
But perhaps the letter carrier had odd hours and I missed the Saturday delivery.
The tone of her letter was also odd. 
Seemingly familiar but altogether different. 
But her name was still signed at the bottom. 
The opening sentences in the same apologetic manner as always.
“Sorry I haven’t written in so long…” etc.
“Life has been kinda crazy lately…” etc
“Please forgive my delay…” etc
I sat on the front step and smoked, reading her letter over a few times. 
Typical response of little substance and shortly stated. 
A response of two pages, single spaced, hand written to my last correspondence of eight pages edited three times and neatly hand printed with care.
I placed her letter in my coat pocket and the handy man extracted my key. 
Just soon enough for me to be late for work.
She was one of those childhood friends that grew up and moved away only to return later. 
Her return was dawn breaking. 
Her second coming was fireworks. 
She came back a butterfly.
There was a time as children. 
We were at the beach as children may. 
Our mothers within sight sunning themselves and talking as mothers do.
We had been making sandcastles, in a sense, I suppose, competitively. 
She had hers and I had mine. 
After the initial spree of building, of going as tall and grand as can be, we stopped to admire our architectural achievements. 
Then she concluded that we were not complete. 
She decided that our castles should meet and would be better as a single castle of magnificent scale.
I remember mine would fall apart at times. 
A tower here, sliding back into the beach. 
A rampart there, dissolving into grainy lumps. 
Each of these was carefully restored. 
She giving strength; I adding artful touch.
Then the tide came in.
In our creative efforts we hardly noticed until the waves rolled up to our ankles. 
We hurried to build a moat in order to control the water. 
We built walls around our palace to protect our project from the slow flow of time.
The moon majestically pulling apart everything we built.
That was a long time ago. 
Before her handwriting changed. 
Before she came back and we started writing letters instead of building sandcastles.
There was something unsettling about the letter. 
The weight of it in my coat pocket was off. 
The feel of the paper was foreign. 
The ink a kind of sinister imposter. 
The more I thought about it, the less it seemed real. 
Like when a dream is vivid just after waking and the details fade into the day as the light replaces night and the rain keeps coming down erasing footprints and putting puddles in their place. 
This was just after I had to leave for my own reasons. 
The time seemed right and altogether a complete mistake, but I needed change and I needed new and I didn’t really know anything. 
It seemed like a time to start knowing. 
And that could only happen by leaving in hopes of building my own cocoon from which to emerge at some kind of culmination. 
In hopes of receiving some kind of growth or whatever it is that triggers change from what will be into what is now.
The point is, she came back and then I left and we wrote letters to each other. 
And one day her handwriting changed.
…
A new address always takes time for me to get used to. 
For some reason I always have trouble remembering zip codes. 
This new apartment is really only new to me. 
Whoever was here before left little to no personal impression. 
My room feels like a hotel room. 
Like I’m only staying for a few nights and then the maid will come by in the morning with fresh towels and clean sheets and my brief history here will be erased by laundry detergent and bleach.
The only traces I have of a previous occupant are the letters that come once a week.
At first I thought they should be forwarded to her. 
The letters were all addressed to a woman. 
But the landlady said she left no information. 
That she couldn’t be traced. 
I waited two months for a solution before I started opening envelopes. 
Each one seemed crafted, created with great care. 
The words and sentences all lined up like neatly polished objects in a store window. 
Each letter was signed with love. 
Each one was dated and told stories from a life that seemed distant and tragic. 
Confused and consistently chaotic. 
There was a kind of sadness in them. 
Sincere and honest and lacking. 
There was always a sense that something was missing. 
That something important was left out. 
Only because it could not be included. 
For whatever reason.
I decided to write back after the letters continued coming. 
I don’t know why, but I pretended that I was the girl being written to. 
In retrospect that was one of those decisions that usually ends badly. 
I had to do something. 
And I couldn’t bear to tell him that the woman he’d been writing had disappeared. 
So I wrote back. 
Just like I had been writing him all along. 
At first it felt very unnatural. 
I’m not much of a letter writer myself. 
After the first few, the process was easier. 
After a while, it was something I did on weekends just as casually as making pancakes on Sunday.
His letters were just so nice. 
And he seemed to take such care in them. 
Like a child making a house out of cards. 
A house he will always take down and put back in the deck. 
Cards that everyone else uses to gamble or play games. 
Cards he sees great potential in. 
Even if only through the eyes of a child that creates temporal things when left alone. 
Lacking in a partner that would rather make him go fish. 
Or go to war.
There was a week when the letter didn’t come. 
I checked the mailbox several times and it never came. 
I took out a flashlight, thinking that maybe I had missed the feel of the envelope with my fingers and perhaps the paper had caught on some fold of metal.
That weekend I couldn’t sleep. 
I stayed awake in bed feeling tired and anxious. 
Exhausted and restless. 
That feeling that something far away had happened. 
And the repercussions, the ripple from some stray raindrop would roll to shore as a wave strong enough to crush an entire kingdom.
In the morning my consciousness finally faded out and I dreamed one of those dreams.
I was in my parent’s house and the man who wrote the letters was there too, except he was not with me. 
There was another woman by his side and I could never see their faces. 
My parents doted on them, cooked them dinner, insisted they stay the night— in my old room. 
I was to sleep in the guest room. 
My mother remarked on nice they were. 
How they seemed like peas in a pod. 
Like peas and carrots. 
She never acknowledged my presence.
We had run out of food and my pen pal was still hungry. 
The faceless woman found old bread—stale and decrepit. 
Crusted with mold. 
She drowned the bread in butter and threw it in the microwave.
“This is terrible.” I thought to myself.
I got a bowl and some flour, water, yeast, salt. 
And as I was mixing the dough I looked down at my hands and woke up feeling like someone had been wringing out my stomach and tenderizing my chest with a mallet.
I woke and got out of bed. 
Only an hour had passed since I had slept. 
I read the paper but only saw words on cheap newsprint. 
I turned on the television and none of it made sense to me. 
I opened the door and looked outside. 
The parking lot was still there. 
Everything was in its place and nothing seemed to belong where it was. 
I walked out to my mailbox and opened it. 
I felt eyes on me and across the street there was a figure watching.
He looked weary, maybe homeless. 
Disheveled hair and beard long neglected. 
His eyes sunk into his face like stones dropped in a river made of skin. 
His eyes watched my hands pull a letter from the mailbox. 
I looked again and he sat down on the curb. 
He pulled a bag of tobacco from his coat. 
He rolled a cigarette with shaking fingers.
I walked back to my apartment looking over my shoulder. 
He lit his cigarette and stared at the road. 
At nothing. 
At a rock long ago thrown into frozen water. 
He got to his feet and walked away.
Inside my apartment again I open a letter not addressed to me. 
There is a single sentence on a single page.
That was the last letter he wrote.
That was the day his handwriting changed.
The bus to San Jose will cost four dollars. 
It will cost four dollars and take forty-five minutes of your life away. 
 If you get the timing right, the sunset will come over the summit. 
 The musky, moldy orange glow will grow darker. 
Shades of violet will creep into the blue-orange-crushed velvet purple-getting darker-black. 
The colors will cha-cha like two paint cloud partners becoming one with the music. 
The bus will roar madcap down, down into the trees, leaning into every curve. 
If you look out the window now there will be a blur of green branches. 
If you look out the other side you will see a guard rail stained with carelessness. 
 If you look ahead you will see a yellow broken yang line stretching and twisting down, down. 
 Then the trees will thin out. 
A reservoir will be spread out before you. 
A dry beach, growing weeds awaiting winter rains will come and go on the left and right sides. 
 And then all that will be left is freeway. 
Nothing but concrete and steel. 
This is a good time to read. 
 The sneaking suspicion that this bus was not going to make it around all of those curves is gone. 
 You can officially relax.
The next time you look up there’s a dancing pig in neon lights. 
 Pure Pork Sausage. 
 This is when you know you’ve reached the station. 
 The train station is always a train station. 
 There are pews like a church in neat little rows. 
There’s an alter, behind which stands the dispenser of train tickets and information. 
In the back are restrooms and a small gift shop. 
If you need change the time is now. 
 If you need refreshment, now is the time. 
If you have needs, make sure they are met and do it quickly. 
 The bus you need will leave, just like Bono sang, with or without you. 
 The bus you need is the 180 Express to Fremont. 
It will take longer than the train, but the train doesn’t run for at least thirty more minutes. 
It is officially dusk now. 
The sun is completely gone and only a highlighted after thought on the horizon remains. 
 Now it’s the city’s turn to brighten up. 
The street lights, the bar signs, the headlights, the billboards all come to attention. 
 They all shine brighter; the Earth turns her back on the Sun, twisting into darkness. 
You can lean your head against the window. 
You always sit at the back corner, right side preferred, giving you a seat for your feet and some head space.	The silent city seen through a bus window passing you by; the hum and blur of broken buildings, broken homes, and shattered dreams. 
All of it just outside your window. 
When you arrive in Fremont at the Bart station, you will have to make a few serious decisions. 
There is a restroom here, a drinking fountain, and a hot dog vendor. 
 This may be a tricky operation. 
It will take careful consideration and clever timing to make everything go smoothly. 
 Impulsively you buy a hot dog. 
 The menu offers hot dogs, super hot dogs and polish sausage. 
Everything will cost three-fifty. 
 German engineering and Polish sensibilities. 
 All nestled in a steamed bun. 
Life is short and time is precious. 
You only live once. 
You make sure he puts everything on it. 
You did almost die on the bus ride over. 
It’s only fair to yourself. 
It’s three-fifty well spent. 
It’s three dollars and fifty cents closer to nirvana then you will ever be for the rest of your life. 
Savor that sausage. 
Pure pork sausage, probably. 
You can smoke or toke or stretch for a minute. 
Use the restroom, drink from the fountain. 
The hard part is over. 
 On the platform there is one train. 
This is the end of the line. 
There’s only turning back for these trains. 
Retrace your tracks. 
Go back from whence ye came. 
The life of a train is nothing but constant rejection. 
No one ever wants you to hang around. 
Some people will come and see you, but they always leave. 
You will always spend the night alone if you are a train. 
 The only friends a train will ever have are an assortment of familiar strangers.
You enter the doors for Richmond bound train. 
It is Sunday, and all the trains from this station will go to Richmond. 
This is good. 
Your chances of fucking this up are slim to none. 
All you have to do is get off at the right time. 
It’s just a matter of waiting, watching, and waving goodbye. 
 All you have to do now is wait until you hear, “Next stop, Ashby. 
Ashby station.” Please stand clear of the doors. 
The doors are closing. 
Please stand clear of the doors. 
It is inevitable that at some point along this line, at some station on this map, a very fat woman will sit down in your car. 
This will always be a mystery to you. 
Every train, every time. 
The fat woman will find you. 
And she will read her supermarket bought, paperback book. 
Checkout aisle fiction. 
She will have glasses on the edge of her nose. 
The kind of glasses with straps, so as not to fall from her head. 
She will eye you indifferently. 
She will read again.
The train is smooth enough to allow you to write. 
A ballpoint, a notebook and a seat to yourself. 
The only thing missing, that would make this ideal, is a beverage service. 
At the very least allowance to drink on the train. 
If only, maybe someday, maybe later. 
You sit facing the end of the train, watching everything fade away from you. 
Outside the sprawl becomes denser. 
The freeways and highways and streets mingle with factories, warehouses and low income housing. 
There is no wrong side to the tracks. 
They are equal in their depravity. 
If there were still sunlight you could see a maze of paint running along the fences and sides of buildings. 
Hundreds of names and slogans. 
Along the roads and off ramps, the glow of a thousand lights, the buzz and hum of a million voices all come together at the horizon. 
All that noise crosses the bridges; the major arteries and veins, pumping people in and out of city you left your heart in. 
 You will hear the words, “Next stop, Lake Merritt. 
 Lake Merritt station.” When you hear those words the view and the city and the sky will be replaced by your own reflection. 
This is when you will smile at yourself and remember that you should be writing something.
You are almost home. 
Ashby is right after MacArthur. 
Ashby is the next underground after the MacArthur breath of air station. 
The train dives back into the earth and you emerge moments later. 
The air will be crisp as autumn air should be. 
It will not be cold or warm; it will be the temperature of transition. 
Your baggage will be heavy and painful on your shoulders. 
Ten minutes. 
Ten more minutes of walking and you will be home. 
You take Ashby down to Sacramento. 
You will pass the Malcolm X Elementary School. 
This means you went in the right direction on Ashby. 
Congratulate yourself; you don’t have to turn around. 
You will make a right on Sacramento. 
From here you will walk past Julia Street. 
Then you will see Russell and that’s where you turn in. 
The lock on the gate will be broken, which is useful since you will not have a key. 
You will walk up to the door of apartment 15 and it will open for you. 
Inside the apartment, the roommate will talk to a moth that only mumbles, ruminating over a small pile of resin. 
You are home now, and you can finally relax.
It might have been day three, or week three or year three. 
The point is that I stumbled home and in the door and no one was there. 
Especially after I walked in.
It had been, it will be, it continues on as one of those stretches of time marked by nothing in particular. 
By nothing of significance. 
By not a goddamn bit of anything of any importance whatsoever. 
Especially not to anyone worth mentioning. 
I found myself lying face down in the bed, in between a stain of dubious origin and bit of stray ashes from an unknown time period. 
The ashes were probably from a cigarette. 
I might have smoked it before saluting consciousness in a mock gesture of farewell. 
As if I may never see it again. 
Like we were both going separate ways. 
That we may never meet afterward. 
 Should I be so lucky. 
That is not to say that I was planning on dying, in any real sense of the word. 
At least, not any time soon. 
More so that I felt disenfranchised from life and that these things happened around me regardless of any effort on my part whatsoever. 
That the bed would continue collecting stains, from me or the ceiling, or maybe even the floor should there be a flooding, or some other misfortune inflicted in the general direction of the mattress I claimed as home. 
The days would continue to pass with not so much as a recognizable sound bite that couldn’t be salvage later when a similar event transpired. 
With or without me. 
Everything will and would continue just as it had before me. 
Just as it will when I’m gone. 
There is a feeling, a sense of, I suppose, abandonment. 
 I liken it to being trapped in a well. 
Although I have never had the pleasure of such an experience firsthand. 
I imagine it to be cold and dark and damp. 
I imagine that light is only manifest as a pin prick of dim flecks of the sun that pass overhead. 
That everyone and thing passes overhead like a far away event. 
As if watching a movie without sound through a pair of out of focus binoculars centered on a drive-in theater in the distance. 
That’s about where i was. 
Face down in the mattress of a movie that was five miles away.
This story isn’t about me, but I’m going to see what I can do to make it about me.
I heard the front door open and close. 
The sound had to walk across the street and up the steps before reaching my ears. 
He was my roommate. 
He had a tendency to keep his distance from the noises he made. 
He flung my door open, increasing the doorknob indentation in the wall just a little more. 
In his right hand was half a pint of plastic bottle whiskey. 
In his left hand was bent cigarette.
“I was going to save this for a special occasion. 
Like waking up tomorrow.” He said. 
He tossed the bottle at my head and went to piss in the bathroom. 
The bottle made a kind of klud noise with a slush at the end. 
He left the door open, talking in between the stream.
“You know…” he paused for effect, letting the downpour echo into the toilet.
“Not really,” I mumbled.
“You know what you are?” He shook his member, draining the last drizzle of digested liquid into the bowl.
“I haven’t the faintest idea.” I turned my head, almost accepting this conversation.
“You’re the epitome of pity me. 
And that’s kind of pathetic.” He flushed and didn’t bother to wash his hands. 
He claimed that his penis was the cleanest part of his body. 
“Thanks,” I said, turning my head to examine the other wall.
“That’s not a compliment. 
Drink up, you’ll feel less shitty for a little while.” He was leaning in my doorway. 
I propped myself up on my elbows and groped around for the bottle in the darkness of late afternoon with all the blinds drawn. 
I found it and put it to my lips until it was light and empty. 
 I threw the bottle back at him and coughed for a minute. 
He caught it and chuckled, throwing the bottle at the wall near the trashcan. 
He missed by a good foot but that wasn’t a problem. 
He walked to the living room and flopped on a couch.
“The day is still young, let’s do some damage.” He was rolling another cigarette on his stomach.
His name was Bernard but he went by Bern. 
I met him the third time I went to college. 
We started living together after everyone else we knew proved unreasonable in domestic situations. 
 We maintained a friendship that was based mostly on our abilities to remain completely indifferent in times when most people panicked or became prone to acts of drama. 
I wouldn’t consider either of us to be sane or rational. 
We could say ‘fuck it’ to damn near anything. 
“There’s a mariachi band in the shower. 
Only when the water’s running though. 
I keep hearing horns.” I mumbled through the aftermath of cheap whiskey on the way down.
“You fascinate me. 
Put some fucking shoes on. 
Let’s get out of here. 
I can’t sit in the house for more than an hour. 
Let’s get sneaky petes and climb the hill to catch the sunset over the bay.” He smoked in such a way that half a cloud would escape; seem to regret the action and retreat back into his mouth for another go.
“Fine. 
Roll me a smoke. 
I require motivation before motivating.” I sat up and put my feet on the ground. 
The hard wood was cold on my soles. 
I reached around for socks. 
I found shoes and a jacket. 
I closed the door and he tossed the cigarette at me. 
He threw the lighter and I lit up and tossed it back.
“Liquor store on Shattuck is cheaper for some reason, let’s get.” The front door was already open and his sunglasses were already on. 
He was a few steps ahead of me. 
He was always a few steps ahead of me.
We locked the door and checked the mailbox and started walking north-west. 
Up and out of the ghetto.
Part 2
The guy at the liquor store checked both of our IDs. 
He didn’t like our looks. 
Said I didn’t look like the guy in the picture. 
He said the guy in the picture had a beard. 
I didn’t have a beard. 
I had shaved a few days before. 
He started a relationship with me based on resentment. 
We took a liter of Coke and a pint of Jack. 
Paper bagging up the suburban streets lined with trees doing that thing that trees do in spring. 
 Blooming, they call it. 
We took turns drinking the Coke until it was half empty. 
Bern thinned it out with the whiskey and we passed it around again.
The suburbs were lined with cars that cost more the further up we went. 
Two increases converging simultaneously on streets. 
A duel incline. 
Something like that. 
We didn’t talk much. 
There wasn’t much need to. 
There was enough going on with spring and dusk creeping around the corner. 
Long shadows and a deadline to get up before the sun went down on the ocean like a luminous head bobbing for apples in a vast liquid emerald bucket. 
The inclined increased and the contents of the coke bottle decreased and we, the both of us, made a transition from mutual apathy to comforting numbness. 
The feeling of not feeling. 
We took turns rolling cigarettes. 
Bern told me about a girl he kept running into, but they were both too chicken-shit to do anything reasonable about it. 
Something like say, “Hi.” At the very least. 
He said every time she came around he was too surprised or too occupied with something else to deal with it. 
“It’s a sign, dude.” I said. 
“You’re going to have to talk to her sometime or she’ll never go away. 
Or she’ll go away too soon and you’ll be regretting not saying anything. 
If you recognize her by now, she probably recognizes you.” I coughed and spat on the sidewalk.
“Yeah, you’re probably right. 
But I have the worst timing. 
It’s unbelievable. 
I’m always a few minutes too late or too early. 
This has been a consistent problem all my conscious life.” He drew in smoke and let it go for a half second before sucking it back in.
We walked with long strides up the hill in a zigzag pattern. 
We passed Telegraph and Bancroft. 
The bottle was getting dangerously low. 
Whiskey can fake a smile. 
In all my years of amateur film criticism, in all the countless hours I’ve spent analyzing theater, infomercials, and my mother, I’ve seen some beautiful smiles forced on Broadway caliber faces. 
Whiskey could nail it. 
Give me half a bottle and there will be a grin waiting for me at the bottom. 
 I blame it on the contented absence of feeling. 
When the whiskey is gone, all you can do is hope whatever was triggering the shit inside is receding like a hairline mimicking the career of a door to door salesman. 
Like an obviously outnumbered army with half a brain seeing the coalescence of forces on the other side. 
Retreating, they call it.
“You know that saying, ‘the lights are on but no one is home’? I feel like I’m home but the power is out and I keep running in to the furniture.” Bern pulled the empty bottle from his pocket and threw it at a tree with gusto. 
The sound of breaking glass made the finality of whiskey a tangible reality.
We passed by the football stadium. 
“Dude, you’re quiet today. 
Hell, you’ve been quiet for like a month now. 
What’s up?” Bern rolled another cigarette as he spoke, packing the tobacco in with his fingers.
“I dunno man, remember that one girl? The bookworm that could talk and talk and talk? I’m still trying to get over her. 
I’m getting older, I can’t keep this up, you know? And I feel like I’m playing out this pattern. 
It’s the same every time. 
Meet a girl, girl has boyfriend, girl leads me on, then she fades away without a word. 
I’m fucking sick of it.” I took a drag of the cigarette and spat on the concrete. 
We walked up the hill and through the parking lot to the forest to the trail that leads to the lookout spot. 
“At least it wasn’t tragic this time. 
I don’t think I could deal with another girl calling me from the hospital on suicide watch.”
“Yeah…” Bern started up a trail through the woods to a log that was just right for perching on when the sun was setting. 
Neither of us was much for relationship advice or relationships in general. 
It was problematic in a sense that we made a problem of it. 
There were problems of a more immediate nature. 
Like money and finding work and keeping food around. 
But women. 
Women were always of more concern for some reason. 
I guess that’s life in your twenties for guys that were raised backwards from a social perspective. 
Don’t talk to strangers. 
Don’t have sex before you’re married. 
Stay in school. 
Graduate and you’ll get a better job. 
Don’t drink or do drugs. 
Smoking will kill you. 
Strangers will kill you. 
Be scared, be quiet, stay out of trouble.
But trouble turned out to be fun. 
Smoking became a form of solace. 
Drinking helped us talk to strangers and meet girls. 
School was like taking the A train to Debt. 
Drugs could open the mind and tilt perspective and open the flood gates to all kinds of crazy experiences. 
The economy went belly up again and the only jobs available were trade jobs. 
Construction, food service, manual labor. 
Always necessary, but still taking a hit. 
Everyone I knew that actually graduated decided to lay low in grad school until things got better. 
Everything we knew was wrong. 
Everything we were taught was horrendously out of date. 
The world was changing, life was changing, and society was constantly evolving. 
So we drank and swapped ideas for getting out of the poverty line. 
We walked up hills and caught a view to put everything in perspective. 
We moved on from one dead end job to the next and it never made a dick of difference. 
We hit the log just in time. 
The clouds over the city were drifting down to the ocean and the sun was making a dive for it. 
The color of the sky shifted from orange and pink to purple blue and darker blue until near black. 
Then the stars would pop into view on the opposite side of the sky. 
We rolled cigarettes and sucked the last drop of Jack and Coke from the bottle, tossing it onto the forest floor. 
Bern would open his mouth to start a syllable that would start a sentence then rethink the thought and take another drag of his cigarette, catching the smoke with his breath and taking it into the folds of his mouth for one last hurrah. 
We smoked dusk into ashes and flicked the butts into the half assed darkness. 
It will be another one of those nights. 
 It will be more like another one of those mornings. 
The ceiling will be as dark as ever. 
Outside your window, the street lights will glow pale jack-o-lantern orange. 
The clocks and your watch all tell you the same thing. 
It’s around five thirty. 
Your body aches and stretches and refuses to find comfort. 
Your mind and your body will be at war. 
The brain struggling to stop a minute and rest up. 
The body in complete agreement, feeling all pins and pin cushion. 
Neither one will know how to cope with this. 
Both will have their ideas and methods. 
None of them will work. 
They will seem to be trying opposing tactics. 
Your body will twist like a frozen ballerina gone horizontal. 
Your head will try and rest a cheek on the pillow despite the direction of your neck. 
You will adjust blankets, flip things around. 
Rearrange. 
Feng shui yourself so many times that eventually the hopelessness of your situation will be all you have left. 
This is when you get up. 
Stretch your legs like something meaningful happened to them over the last few hours. 
 Realize that you didn’t even register a decent nap. 
Your stomach will be the first to complain. 
It will be sour and empty, bloated and bemoaning. 
You will walk to the bathroom, and turn on the faucet. 
Water will wash over your hands, and you will use that water to splash at your face. 
The mirror is not your friend right now. 
It’s only telling you things you don’t want to hear. 
You try the shower. 
You wait. 
Nothing but cold. 
Not even a hint of temperature change. 
The hot water heater is all fucked up. 
This is how your morning starts.
You have two dollars and sixty cents on a left over Bart card. 
There’s eight dollars and twenty five cents in the change receptacle. 
Maybe. 
Just maybe. 
Clothes are changed to maintain the illusion of freshness. 
A light bag is packed with just the essentials for a few days. 
Shoes are tied, a hat is found. 
All of this without making a sound. 
Don’t want to wake the roommate. 
He does sleep in the living room after all. 
There’s no need to be an inconsiderate asshole. 
 Just because you can’t sleep doesn’t mean other people need to suffer. 
Also don’t forget the mints on the desk. 
Those will be your only source of nourishment for the duration of the trip.
In your possession are one book bag, contents being: one large notebook for writing, one notebook computer, one novel with dog eared pages, one small  otebook for note keeping, a CalTrain schedule, a checkbook, an old menu, and one condom. 
You were a boy scout once. 
Be prepared and all that. 
You also carry a nearly empty duffel bag. 
The duffel bag is mostly for the return trip. 
 For carrying some leftover possessions from friend’s houses. 
Random debris from living in between homes. 
This is a light trip and there’s going to be some foot work involved. 
You don’t want to strain yourself. 
That would be completely unnecessary.
You are bundled in triple layers with thick, wool socks. 
It’s only just before six. 
It’s still as dark as you remember. 
 The walk down Sacramento will be brief and uneventful. 
Your eyes will peel the ground for loose change, hopefully a stray dollar bill. 
Anything that might be of use right now. 
Legs move at a steady march. 
Left foot right foot up Ashby. 
Right side of the road. 
That’s where the station is. 
Right across the chain link fence. 
The construction is finally done, no need for a detour. 
The early risers set up for a flea market. 
 Could have sworn that was a Sunday operation, but no matter. 
Old people with their pickup trucks unpack wares on to folding tables. 
They don’t seem groggy. 
They are not fazed by the hour and the darkness. 
This is puzzling to your mind. 
How do they do it? What’s the secret? Where were you when they handed out the brochures on how to maintain at six in the morning on a Saturday…? You must have been sleeping. 
That would be a reasonable assumption. 
That would be perfectly understandable given your history of Saturdays. 
But no matter. 
The train awaits.
The station is quiet. 
There are a total of three other people here. 
No one says anything. 
Everyone just stares with vacant eyes at nothing in particular. 
A pigeon mingles around. 
He’s the life of the party. 
He walks up to you. 
He looks at you, bobbing his head to a silent beat. 
You like the guy. 
He’s got moxie. 
He doesn’t think much of you and he moves on. 
The sting of rejection comes in waves. 
It echoes every time you hear, “Fremont train in six minutes.” “Fremont train in four minutes.” Reassurance. 
Moving on. 
Soon there will be a seat. 
Soon you can sit down again in a moving box racing along a track at the speed of light through predawn darkness. 
There’s a light at the beginning of the tunnel. 
The guttural roar of several tons of steel pushing air through a subterranean tube. 
The wind pipe of the world projectile vomiting mass transit right in front of you.
Fremont bound train. 
This is a Fremont bound train. 
The doors are closing. 
Please stand clear of the doors. 
This will be your mantra for an hour. 
Commit it to memory. 
Repeat it softly to yourself like a prayer. 
Hail Bart Train full of sleepy eyed end of shift civilians. 
I am with thee. 
Take comfort in this. 
These are your people. 
The mailman rests in the seat across from you. 
The off duty security guard reading a romance novel. 
The couple behind you, keeping conversation in order to avoid nodding off. 
Outside the window lies the void. 
Beyond the window a vast field of ink. 
 The train emerges into the Oakland streets running alongside MLK. 
Rows of streetlights cut through the ink giving the outline of roads and sleepy urban shops. 
Along the hillside little dots of oranges and yellows like pinpricks in a giant rolling hump of blackness. 
If you tilt your head uncomfortably you can see the beginning of dawn coming up. 
The band of morning tuning up their instruments in the pit before the stage of the world. 
Despite the discomfort in straining your neck to see, you feel it’s vital to keep a close eye on the proceedings. 
Not often enough are the chances to see a sunrise from the train. 
What amazes right now is how unlike a sunset this is. 
If the earth is a big spinning ball, rotating in a vacuum with other spheres of gravitational influence, then should a sunrise and sunset look the same? But the light changes when it comes and goes. 
The clouds will alter the course of things. 
Everything affects everything else.
You can hear the strings start softly on the horizon. 
The cellos and violas weaving a tapestry of light in iridescent oranges with purple hues. 
 The first violin begins to lead in flames. 
A fire dance of seven veils rising from the east. 
All of this seems to move slowly. 
Agonizing tension building up behind the hills, waiting to ejaculate in a crescendo of full symphonic sunlight. 
And this is all background noise.
The foreground hubbub is MacArthur station. 
Last chance transfer point. 
The train runs parallel with another, coming into the station chasing a reflection. 
The people hurry in and out. 
Split second dodging to make it through the doors in time. 
Everyone with their baggage. 
Suitcases, book bags, briefcases, backpacks. 
Everyone with a place to be and things to do. 
The doors are closing. 
Please stand clear of the doors.
Again, again through the sprawl. 
Along a rail floating over the city. 
District to district, station to station. 
The streets are lit with a pale tease, the sun being fashionably late and always right on time. 
Parking lots and warehouse mingle with the suburbs. 
Barber shops and nail salons. 
And all those liquor stores. 
Lake Merritt to Fruitvale. 
The Coliseum to San Leandro. 
Bay Fair transfer point. 
Hayward to South Hayward and Union City. 
Then Fremont with dead fields and dead ends.
While the city speeds by underneath you the sky turns bright as a light bulb in the belly of a suffocated baby blue. 
The sun peaks over the hill. 
The old bastard moves slowly for the first few minutes. 
Stretching his arms while getting the chariot ready. 
Good old grandfather Sun. 
Always apollonic in his race across the heavens. 
You will hear “Fremont, Fremont station. 
End of the line.” Check everything. 
 A Bart train is a terrible place to lose something. 
If you linger any longer you will once more hear “The doors are closing. 
Please stand clear of the doors.” And out you go into the rapidly warming morning. 
It’s still cold enough to warrant three layers, and now you could use those sunglasses. 
 You walk down the stairs and slip your card into the slot on the turnstile. 
It will blink at you in red letters and reject your card. 
You do not have enough money to make it through. 
The thought of passing right behind someone, or under the mechanical gates crosses your mind. 
The guard might look away long enough. 
You’ve done this before.
For some reason this seems like a bad idea right now. 
Reluctantly you extract the bag full of coins that was supposed to be bus fare. 
You need one dollar and forty cents to make the turnstile happy. 
You figure this is a good chance to use up the nickels. 
Trying to count out nickels in the line for the bus would be a pain in everyone’s ass. 
But here there is no line and no driver. 
Just a machine for taking your money and turning it into an exit visa.
Being outside the station will be refreshing. 
The air will be crisp and cool. 
The sun is making great leaps in the sky. 
He’s well off the horizon when you look again. 
Time to sit down again and count your change. 
Separate into two places for each bus. 
Three fifty for the San Jose bound bus. 
Four dollars for the seventeen express. 
Why it’s called an express bus will be a mystery. 
There is no non-express seventeen bus. 
It seems an unnecessary extension. 
And any bus that takes forty minutes never feels quite like an express trip. 
Who names and numbers the buses? How do you get that job? What kind of qualifications would you list on a resume for such a thing?
You are seventy-five cents short. 
There is no other coinage at your disposal. 
There is another way. 
By the entrance to the station there’s a man selling hot dogs. 
He’s setting up shop now. 
A reminder of just how early it really is. 
He’s filling chests full of ice and beverages. 
Future passengers mingle, smoke, sit, meander in circles. 
This is why you brought the hat. 
The hat hits the concrete by the steps of the station. 
You pull out a C harp from your coat pocket and start warming up. 
You play up and down, checking all the notes for clarity. 
Making sure no lint is stuck in the reeds. 
Everything sounds about right. 
The draw for the three hole is a little too tight, but no matter. 
Just bend the shit out of it and hope for the best.
You start with a basic blues riff. 
Add a little rhythm and start improvising. 
Play off an idea; throw in hints of other songs. 
Speed it up a little. 
Slow it down. 
Blow soft high notes and put some soul into it. 
Take it to train noises. 
A chugging beat and a whistle blow. 
Wail on that harp like you really need seventy-five cents. 
Let your breath and your lips sing a sad song and take it back to melody that could begin with the words, I woke up this morning. 
Run a few lazy circles around the notes and always take it back home. 
Toy with concepts. 
Sprinkle some familiar themes in. 
Use your tongue to block one hole while sucking a mean shuddering bend from the two on either side. 
Someone will start paying attention if you do this right.
Ten minutes of this have gone by. 
There’s a man in purple shirt, reading a paper. 
He walks over and drops a folded one dollar bill into your hat. 
Mission accomplished. 
Fare has been taken care of. 
You decide to keep playing for a while. 
The bus won’t be here for another twenty minutes. 
You might as well try and make a little extra. 
You switch to an old G harp with a cracked comb. 
The sound is deeper and resonates at a lower frequency. 
 The song escaping into morning air is just a traveling song, always in transition. 
Rambling along right by your side. 
The one eighty express pulls up to the station. 
 A small crowd has gathered around in waiting. 
When did they get here? Who invited so many people to your party? The man that funded your exodus is here too. 
He’s ok. 
He’s on the list. 
But the children. 
Why the hell are there so many kids going to San Jose on a Saturday morning?  They’re all wearing black shirts with the same design on them. 
Could be a youth group or some kind of school thing. 
Nonviolent gang members, maybe. 
Point is, they are going to take up a lot of space and prattle and rattle on like school children do. 
The calm peace of the morning will dissipate into madness of mindless chatter.
You have to make sure you get a seat. 
Sitting down on this bus is going to be vital. 
You adjust your place so you can easily work towards the front of the crowd when the door opens. 
 You might be able to slip in just after all the old people. 
If your timing is right and your foot work is agile. 
You’ll be seated in no time. 
You might even be able to doze off to the white noise of so much blah blah blah.
The first people on all have weary faces. 
They will sit up front and say nothing. 
That’s perfectly acceptable. 
You don’t feel like talking at this hour. 
If you tried to talk right now it would be a disaster. 
You’re tired enough to ramble to complete strangers. 
This is why you take a book when you travel. 
So you don’t just stare at people on a full bus when you can’t look out the window. 
Your seat will be in the front. 
One of the seats that faces more seats on the opposite side. 
You will not be able to look ahead. 
A girl will sit directly across from you. 
Don’t panic. 
She just wanted a seat and took the first one she saw. 
And no, she doesn’t keep looking at you. 
You’re imagining things. 
Read your book. 
Everything is going to be fine. 
Just keep your goddamn head down and read. 
But you check once more and catch her in the act. 
She will think she’s catching you. 
But you know better. 
You’re just trying to read your book.
The bus will roll along and bump and lurch down the freeway. 
The standing children will sway back and forth bending to the will of inertia. 
 The ebb and flow of traffic goes by behind you. 
After a while the bus will stop and all the children will eject themselves onto the sidewalk. 
The bus breathes a sigh of relief. 
Everyone readjusts. 
Shifts in their seats to maximum comfort. 
Just keep reading. 
Relax a little, but keep to your book. 
No matter that you’ve been re-reading the same paragraph for ten minutes. 
You could really use a nap about now. 
Sleep sounds like the best of all possible options to occupy your time. 
The bus hits a bump, jarring you and keeping you conscious. 
Oh well. 
Maybe you can just rest your eyes for a while.
Diridon station will stand as stations do. 
The sun will start to feel hot now. 
When you get off the bus the coat will not seem as necessary as it did earlier. 
There is a drinking fountain in the station. 
Have a mint and drink some water. 
You have one more bus to catch and it won’t be here for while. 
You have time to spare. 
You could throw the hat down again. 
Maybe make a few extra bucks. 
A little something for a cup of coffee. 
Instead you get out the laptop and do some writing. 
The time will go by quickly if your write. 
Forty more minutes of waiting will not go to waste if you can create something. 
 This is how you started writing this morning down. 
The seventeen express will arrive on time. 
You will put everything away and get out the bag of change. 
You will be left with twenty seven cents. 
That will be of no use to you. 
There is  othing you can buy anywhere for twenty seven cents anymore. 
 You climb aboard and put your life savings into coin slot for a bus. 
This one is not so crowded. 
You take a seat at the back by the window. 
Remove your coat and long sleeve shirt. 
Good thing that duffel bag is mostly empty. 
Lean your head on something and close your eyes. 
The extent of your exhaustion is becoming readily apparent. 
Outside the morning has turned into a day. 
Those with weekend jobs commute in their cars along the many lanes of highways. 
Trucks make their deliveries. 
Beach bound surfers drive hatchbacks and old Volvos over the mountain everyone calls a hill. 
The bus takes a break from all this concrete and urban atmosphere. 
The trees become thicker with every turn. 
When you reach the summit you have a few seconds to glance at the green valley below. 
 Every leaf bathed in light. 
Every urge in you trying to get some rest. 
There’s not much time. 
You think, maybe when you get off the bus, find a quiet place and lay down for a while. 
But that’s just not going to happen. 
So much to do and so little time. 
You rest your eyes when you can.
The bus will take to an incline, tilting ever so slightly into Scotts Valley. 
The people around you will make small talk. 
It will all sound like mumbles and jabbering. 
The three girls that look like they’re on the way home from a party. 
The business man that claims to be a dance choreographer, making conversation when he can. 
The travelers all making their way into Santa Cruz for the weekend. 
Scotts Valley transit center will be the only punctuation until the full stop at the metro. 
You can try to wake up a little more now. 
The rest of the bus ride will be brief. 
Gather your things and get ready to exit on Ocean Street.
On the curb by the gas station you get off with a small handful of other people. 
You cut across Water St. 
and walk past the court house. 
If you’re lucky, right now your phone will ring. 
The only person that knows you’re in town will call. 
You will pick up the phone and listen and be happy to hear the voice on the other end of the line. 
You will be distracted by that voice until you make it to the back yard of a friend’s apartment. 
Here you will sit, talking for as long as possible. 
Your friend will mill about the house, looking at you in surprise and asking you for cigarettes you don’t have. 
That’s the same thing he asked you last time you saw him. 
It’s the same question he will ask you every time you see him all weekend. 
Instead of hello, or hey man, or how’s it going? Instead he will say, smoke? Got a cigarette?
You ask to use the shower to wash away all that traveling. 
Not to mention last night’s work. 
 It’s going to be a long day and now you have all the time in the world to do as you please. 
 Shower quickly and diligently. 
Let the hot water give you a fourth or fifth wind. 
Shave, comb your hair, look respectable. 
It’s time to find some people and figure out how to eat something today. 
 Everything else just happens as it will. 
After priorities, the rest is only details. 
You’re going to be fine. 
You’re going to make it.
He fidgets nervously, trying not to keep his eyes too long in one spot. 
Hands tapping on the knees, smoothing out creases in his pant legs.
“I’m kinda stuck,” she says while pouring hot water through a tea strainer, loose leaves bleeding richer in color at the bottom of a cup.
“Stuck?” he asks, “stuck how?”
“Stuck here, in this place, this city, this job, these debts.”
“Tell me about it.”
“No, seriously. 
I can’t get my mind off it for a minute.”
“This too shall pass,” he says in tones of quotable dignity.
“Who said that?”
“You did, about a month ago.”
“Well here’s to my unwavering genius,” She hands him a hot mug.
“Cheers,”
They blow over the surface making waves.
“Is this it?” She inquires, not yet drinking.
“Is what it?” After a sip.
“Is this life? In and out of debt, job to shitty job, all too short lapses, tea and smoke breaks.”
“Well, what do you want out of life?” Yes, let’s make a list.
“What do I want?” she sits down next to him and rests her head back on the couch, starring at the ceiling with seldom blinking eyes.
“Fuck if I know, man. 
Hand me my smokes, in my purse.”
He extracts a pack from her handbag, produces one long white cylinder, and hands it to her filter first.
“Lighter?” She mimes flicking one.
He pulls a book of matches from his pocket, strikes and holds it up, flame touching the end starting the cherry.
“Thanks,” she says smiling, exhaling a lazy puff of white smoke.
He sets a small glass pipe on the coffee table and goes to the kitchen for a spice jar and a lighter. 
He unscrews the lid, breaks up a bud on the cover of The Paris Review and packs a bowl.
“Tea and more tea, how thoughtful you are,” She says with wrinkles at the corners of her eyes.
“Balance my dear. 
Life is all balance.”
“Balance between what? The madness of survival, of going nowhere and routine, between struggle and suffering?”
“Hardly.” He sparks the green on one side, leaving a courtesy patch for the girl. 
He holds it in a few seconds and coughs a little, sending smoke signals.
“The balance between good and hard times. 
Between lonely nights and social days. 
Bitter tea and honey sweetened with a touch of milk. 
Sobriety here, debauchery there, you know.”
“Mmm.” Agreement to a degree. 
She takes her hit, cigarette between the ring and pinky knuckle. 
She takes a sip after exhale and a drag after that.
“I want an adventure,” She declares, breaking the smoky silence.
“An adventure? You want to stumble on a map and look for long lost treasures, sail the high seas?”
“Absurd, you and your sensible realism.” She hands the pipe back.
“No, nothing so past romantic, but I do want to travel. 
Get the hell out of the States at least. 
See the world, run into some fantastic people with foreign accents, wander Paris streets at dusk, have tea in London, smoke weed in Amsterdam, you know.”
“Drink deep from the well of life and all that.”
“Yes, and all that.”
He pulls a long harsh throat searing hit and coughs hard.
“Easy there,” She flicks the ash from her cigarette into a cold, stone ashtray.
“It’s so frustrating right? At our age.” He says finally after a long slug of tea.
“Mmm,” she agrees again. 
“Getting out and getting started. 
Always so broke. 
God, I hate this.” She pushes smoke out hard between pursed lips, grimacing.
“There’s always plan b.” He grins.
“And what’s that? Win the lottery? There’s a sure bet.”
“No, no. 
Marry a rich doctor, bleed him dry and run away.”
“Always with the realistic suggestions. 
No, fuck that. 
I’m not the marrying type, not even for purely selfish reasons.”
“What? I’m sure you could pull that off, if you could bare a little creepy doctor sex.”
“Ugh, never. 
I could see him now, inserting his dick with surgical precision, leaving on his socks and stethoscope.” She laughs a little, shakes her head and takes the pipe extended in her direction. 
She sparks it and pulls deep to her diaphragm. 
Coughing a little after holding it.
“So you didn’t grow up collecting cut outs from bridal magazines, meticulously planning your wedding day?”
“How vulgar. 
Never. 
Ever. 
I’m no sacrifice to the great god routine. 
I’m not breeding material, not a mother by any means. 
Couldn’t stand it. 
I’m so over the whole idea.”
“How about you?” she asks.
“How about me?”
“Marriage, kids, white picket fences, a nine to five and meatloaf once a week?”
“A model 1950’s atomic cold war family.” He digs around in his pockets for cigarettes and comes up empty.
“Be a doll and lend me one?”
“Promise to return the favor?” she asks.
“I don’t make promises. 
Ruins my reputation. 
But to answer your question, no. 
I fall in love too often. 
Too fickle. 
I’d make a terrible husband and a flakey father. 
I need to able change scenes at a moment’s notice. 
It’s not that I fear commitment, it’s just not for me.”
And you’ve been here how long?”
“20 years.”
“Swell job you’re doing on this crazy life plan.”
“Give it time, I’m still young.” He lights up, blowing two successful smoke rings and a few failures.
“Never could do that.”
“It’s all in the lips.” He winks.
“Well, what do you want out of life?”
“Me? A few funny stories, a few close friends. 
A witty inscription on my tombstone. 
A lot of good laughs.”
“How’s that coming along?”
“So far, pretty damn well. 
Maybe someday I’ll turn the whole mess into a book.”
“Do it. 
I’d love to read it.”
“Then I could honestly say that my life is an open book. 
Or a neglected work of genius on the dusty shelves of the used book stores of America.”
“In the laps of a million hipsters, coffee stained and ashed on pages. 
You, the antihero of a generation.” She laughs at this.
“Hey, it could happen.
“Hopeless romantic, you.”
“Muse and inspiration, you.”
“Serious?”
“Deathly so.”
“You’re sweet,” she says.
“Thanks, I try. 
Someone needs to compliment your overbearing bitter pessimism. 
“
“Pfft, fuck you.”
“Should you be so lucky.”
“God! You’re terrible.”
“Everyone needs a hobby.” They sit a minute.
“How’s that bowl doing?” She inquires.
“Ass. 
Ashes. 
Gone and forgotten.”
“Tragic. 
I won’t forget you little bowl. 
And your precious cargo.”
She salutes the ashtray and he smirks at her.
“You’re terribly silly.” He observes.
“Defensive reflex, purely. 
A serious life is not one worth living. 
Seriousness is reserved for taxes and funerals.”
“That’s a good way of looking at it. 
That’s balance.”
“I balance on the tight rope of life, precariously cautions of the safety net below, tip toeing towards the infinite abyss of the other side.” She radiates.
“What’s that from?”
“My very stoned, warped little mind.” She takes in the last of her tea.
“I’m drained, how’re you?”
“Running on empty.”
“Another cup?”
“Wanna go for a walk? Lovely night for it.”
“Sure. 
Got a coat you can lend me?”
“Should be a few in the closet. 
I should pick up a pack too.”
“Then we’re on a mission.”
“A mission for cigarettes?”
“Start small. 
Maybe we’ll get swept up into something crazy.”
“Locals start world conquest at corner store. 
More at eleven.”
“There’s always hope.”
“Even for the likes of us?”
“Especially.”
She waits at the landing while he locks the door; lights another cigarette.
“Lighter thief!” he declares.
“Forethought.” She corrects him.
“Bum a drag?”
“Want a whole one?”
“I suppose. 
How habitual of me.” And after lighting, “thanks.”
They stand a minute, still stoned, red dry eyed. 
Puffing slow drags into the night air. 
A chill breeze blows it all away, wispy and fading into the moonlit clouds. 
They descend, lady first, down the steps and on to the sidewalk.
It’s three city blocks to the corner store. 
It’s four dollars and fifty-eight cents for a pack of cigarettes. 
He taps the cellophane wrapped box on the inside of his wrist, three times hard and fast. 
Peels off the plastic and hands her two.
“A perfect gentleman.” She smiles thanks instead of intoning it.
“Always, without regret.” Then, after lighting a fresh one, “but it never gets me laid.”
“A pity, really. 
No sex appeal for gentlemen,”
“So it is. 
futile exercises in human sexuality. 
I’m no alpha male, and I despise meat-headed cavemen.”
“Also a pity. 
Every girl likes her hair pulled.” She adds, “of course there’s a time and place.”
“In the backseats and bedrooms of the world…”
“In the restrooms and counter tops, the couches and beach blankets…”
“Don’t forget hot tubs.”
“Mmm, hot tub sex. 
It’s been a while.”
“Do spare me.”
“You don’t want details for once?”
“You’ve expounded on your sexual exploits to me on numerous occasions. 
I really don’t need any reminders that you’re way more experienced than me.”
“Sorry, I didn’t mean…”
“You never do. 
But still…” he sighs.
“Where should we go? Objective completed and all.”
“Through the park? Mayhaps around the block?”
“Let’s wander and end up at the river.”
“That’s a good plan.”
“Not a plan, don’t make plans. 
Plans get broken.”
“Then what is it?” he asks.
“It’s a goal, a new objective, to be reached by any means necessary.”
He digests this for a minute, smoking between the index and middle fingers.
“Plans are too specific,” she adds, “much too much for me.”
“What are your other goals?”
“My other goals…Hmm short or long term?”
“Short then long.”
“Short term, this week, find a new job that I can stand. 
Pay the electric, do some laundry and call my mom.”
“Fairly standard to do list. 
What about long term?”
They walk at a slow matched pace and she mulls over the answer.
“Get the hell out of town. 
Leave some kind of mark on the world.”
“I scrawl my mark on the stalls of the world in black marker, for a good time call…”
“Very funny.”
“I try.” He runs his fingers over the gaps of a chain link fence, sending vibrations everywhere.
“Let’s rest a minute on this convenient bus bench.”
“Alright.”
She sits down, her legs flopping exaggeratedly in the air, over doing the momentum.
“What did you dream about doing when you were a kid?” She asks him resting her head on his shoulder.
“I’m still a kid.” He says, avoiding the question.
“Hardly and regardless.” Flatly demanding a real answer.
“If you must know, I wanted to be an astronaut or a scientist.”
“Really?” Somewhat incredulous.
“Swear to Christ.” He says.
“I thought you didn’t believe in Christ?”
“Jesus is less of a person and more of a punctuation mark to me. 
And sometimes he’s an idea.”
“An idea of what?”
“Jesus is, for the most part an idea of how people can get along despite everything.”
“Despite his Jewishness, the roman occupation, being killed for disturbing the peace.”
“He was a troublemaker, yeah.”
“Funny how in Sunday school they drill obedience in your head. 
Jesus was a hell raiser.”
“I thought you never went to Sunday school.”
“Once or twice. 
Too young to remember much.” She states reflectively.
“I like to think of rebellion as the most basic of human tendencies.” She adds.
“I think so too. 
Ever do shit purely for the sake of disobedience?”
“All the time. 
Sometimes to my own detriment.”
“Same. 
Not so many regrets though.”
“Not a fan of regrets. 
Live and learn I guess.”
“I guess so.” Pause.
“C’mon,” he says “Let’s go to the river. 
Smoke another bowl.”
“Fantastic.” She takes out a water bottle hidden within her coat.
“Where the hell did that come from?”
“Pinched it while you were getting smokes.” She smiles.
“Wanna sip?” She asks.
“Please and thank you.” He tilts the plastic bottle, taking a few good swallows; curing long overdue cotton mouth. 
He hands the bottle back, wiping his chin. 
“Ahh,” he exhales, “thanks again.”
“You’re welcome.” She says, screwing the cap back on. 
They stand up and walk along the sidewalk. 
She pretends a seam in the concrete is a balancing beam; walking foot in front of foot, arms out stretched.
“Balance,” she states, “is all about footwork.”
“What if you’re a cripple?”
“Well, then you’re fucked.” She shrugs and jumps off the imaginary beam.
“I give you a nine point two.” He says holding up nothing.
“Tough critic. 
I thought you said I was perfect.”
“You are perfect. 
For me. 
But you’re not flawless.”
“I told you I’m a little fucked up.”
He looks at her in disbelief.
“Ok, really fucked up.”
“You’re not so bad.”
“Thanks,” she says, looking at nothing in particular. 
He bounces a little from foot to foot, avoiding debris and foliage, hands in his pockets.
“Yeah.” He adds after a while.
He takes her hand and walks along her side. 
They take a foot path off the sidewalk, down towards the river.
“Lovely moon for a smoke,” he says, glancing upward.
“Isn’t it?”
There’s a curb in the suburbs. 
Concrete seams at predictable intervals and clusters at mail boxes marking small groups of tract houses. 
Being midday, the sun makes a dial from the pole of a streetlamp. 
Setting the time around just after two in the afternoon. 
A boy of twelve or so eats an apple, ass on the curb, legs crossed at the ankles in the street. 
Taking small, messy bites from a Granny Smith. 
His face gets sticky from the stubborn juices. 
He wipes his hands and chin on the knees of his pants. 
He waits for the mail man. 
The expectation of delivery getting lost with every every destructive jaw motion. 
Mangling the apple flesh. 
Turning a previously gold-green fruit into mushy digestible chunks and eventually, into completely unrecognizable nutrient-less masses of shit.
The apple was purchased at a chain supermarket. 
 Chosen from a meticulously stacked array of similarly polished, at first glance flawless, Granny Smith apples. 
The boy that stacked and polished the apples is still fist deep in public high school, where he’s simultaneously failing physical education, algebra, and chemistry while acing physics and political science. 
He has a penchant for smoking high grade imported hash and polishing fruit. 
He rubs his hands on his pants. 
Hash distracted by a torn patch on his knee. 
Fingers in the fray, toying with the fabric scars left by bike rides in ill lit parking lots. 
He steps out to the alley, extracts a pack of domestic, filtered cigarettes, sits on a dairy crate, lights inhaling and relaxes. 
He musters up mucus and coughs a green-yellow gob, spitting it into a drain grate.
He looks up out beyond the rooftops, to the trees the branches the leaves. 
The breeze blown swaying top story section where a blue jay on look out perches. 
The bird is mildly upset. 
He’s looking for a mate but the scene is dead. 
The lady jays all spent, already egg laying, already reclining post coitus in the nests of so many similar trees. 
The jay had a shot with a pretty little thing with perfect tail feathers. 
She was distracted by brighter plumage and a bigger beak. 
He hovers his ass over the leaves and shits, watching it fall into the passenger seat of a convertible, traffic stuck in a bit of two lane highway. 
 The genus of the tree is of no importance. 
It provides shade in the summer and stark, stoic simplicity during the fall and winter months. 
The fallen leaves are blown into piles into which no children will jump. 
The leaf blower is operated by a scruffy foreigner with big, red eyes. 
He was up for the last two days on a coke binge. 
Now half sedated but still jittery; calming his nerves with cheap beer and decent marijuana.
“Eww! Gross! Omigawd!” A girl’s face rises from the driver’s seat, returning upright on the passenger side. 
“Something just shit on my back!” She squirms.
“There’s some napkins in the glove.”
“Eww! Ugh!” She looks sickly. 
“Get it off me!”
The driver puts his erection away, sighs and takes one of the napkins. 
Some of the shit has run down the small of her back, making a white-yellow streak heading towards the crack of her ass; desperate attempts to return to the source. 
These napkins were meant for other fluids. 
The driver’s disappointment manifesting in his aching groin. 
Blue balled again. 
Stymied by stray shit. 
Just his luck, I suppose. 
He rolls his eyes and sighs, growing impatient. 
Traffic takes longer to move, time crawls. 
The passenger looks more disgusted, having thrown up a little in the back of her throat. 
Reliving the after taste of bile mixed with gin and tonic. 
She puffs her cheeks and exhales slowly.
“Sam,” she mumbles. 
“Pull over.”
“We’re stuck baby, just relax.”
“I’m fucking serious, Sam. 
Pull the goddamn car over. 
 I’m sick.”
“Just lean over the window and let it go, you’ll feel better.”
Sam’s balls refuse to relinquish any sort of sympathy. 
Sam is sick of half-assed foreplay that leads nowhere. 
That’s not really foreplay. 
Foreplay requires after-play. 
Typically intercourse. 
Tension build up to sweet release. 
Tease and please and god, just fuck me. 
He’s sick of being blue balled. 
He’s sick of her playing it off like it’s no big deal. 
That his needs are of no real importance. 
That interrupted road head leads straight to road rage, traffic accidents, parking tickets. 
Malcontented rash decision making. 
That everyone is better off post orgasm. 
I mean fuck, it’s only human. 
The cars move forward, bumper to bumper; motorized molasses. 
The reason for such slow movement comes into view. 
A road side attraction, tall blond with a Sunday hat, three cars stopped to help, debating who gets to wield the tire iron. 
The passenger leans over the window and vomits a steady stream on to the pavement. 
She groans, wiping the run-off from her chin. 
“Christ!” She coughs out another pint of stomach acid and water.
“Feel better?”
“I can’t taste your cock anymore.”
“Congratulations,”  he says through apathetic lips. 
Anything is better than fermented genital sweat.
“I need to go back to the room, Sam.”
“I’m working on it.”
“Sam, I really need to go back to the room.”
“I know, you just told me.”
“I feel sick.”
“You’ve demonstrated as much.”
“I need a shower and a nap and a tooth brush.”
“For fuck’s sake Dee, shut the hell up.”
Note to self; directionless erections lead to a distinct lack of any sort of empathy.
“Don’t tell me to shut up.”
“If you were a woman, I’d slap you. 
Shut up.”
“If I were a woman! If I were a woman! I’m more of a woman then you’ll ever be!”
“Oh Jesus, you’re just another girl in Jackie O sunglasses playing dress up and listening to Aretha Franklin records for validation.”
Dee closes her eyes and puts her hands over her ears. 
Her face falls into her lap and she starts screaming. 
The driver’s side door opens and closes. 
The car is off, the keys are gone and Dee is screaming.
Sam walks down two blocks of sidewalk, puffing on a cigarette. 
He’s breathing through it. 
The cherry takes up half the length. 
His hands are shaking. 
He spies a bar across the street with an unimportant name. 
The bar bares burn scars. 
A historical record of badly aimed cigarette butts. 
Beer buzz eluding attempts to stab at ash trays. 
Sam sits at the bar. 
The bartender takes his order without saying a thing. 
A glass of mostly bottom shelf bourbon holds a few ice cubes; cracking and melting. 
Sam stares at the glass. 
Beads of moisture build up on the exterior.
The glass is half empty now. 
Sam looks out of the dust and grim fogged window at the barber shop across the street. 
He’s wanted to get a haircut for a few days. 
An empty glass sits neglected next to a five dollar bill. 
Sam is sitting in the chair at the barber shop. 
He asks for a trim and tries to relax. 
The electric razor buzzes to life and Sam sits in the chair, eyes closed. 
He feels the hair fall from his head. 
The careful skilled hands of the barber work with quick precision. 
Sam’s hair falls on the floor. 
His eyes are closed. 
The vibrations of the razor dominate his senses. 
He opens his eyes and the razor shuts off. 
In the mirror he looks like a new recruit. 
 He blinks a few times in apathy. 
The barber folds a ten dollar bill into his pocket and gets the broom. 
Sam walks the two blocks back to his car, still parked in the middle of the street. 
He gets in, starts the engine and lets the breeze blow the ticket out from under the wipers. 
He lights another cigarette and drives back to the motel. 
Dee is asleep in the bed. 
He closes the bathroom door and undresses. 
He crawls into bed trying not to wake the woman. 
In the morning, the motel blinds filter dawn light, sending stripes across the bed. 
A bobbing bump under the sheets stirs Sam to consciousness.
“What? Huh?”
“Oh darling,” she muffles under covers. 
Sam groans a little more awake.
“Darling,” she emerges, “Something’s wrong.”
“What could possibly be wrong?”
“I’ve been blowing you for twenty minutes and it hasn’t done a damn thing.”
Sam has gone soft. 
 He stares at the ceiling with empty eyes.
Outside in the early afternoon light there is a tree, basking in and blocking the sunbeams, waves and particles of light, speeding into the leaves of a grand, tall tree. 
Blocking the light from the motel. 
Shielding the motel windows from cancer. 
In the branches there’s a blue jay squawking into the air. 
He rustles the leaves, rustles his feathers and makes some noise. 
He can be loud. 
He can garner attention. 
He leans out of the tree and shits. 
Letting it fall out of him.
The painting hung on a wall where I suppose most paintings belong. 
The painter died long before I did. 
He was one of those Impressionists. 
Could have been Monet or Manet or Manny Fitzpatrick. 
Anyway, he painted a couple on a beach. 
Maybe some French beach before they were all covered with divine jacks after FDR and Jesus played hopscotch on Hitler's ambition.
When I was fifteen the painting wasn't an original--just a reprint on cheap poster board. 
The wall it lived against belonged to my god brother’s family and a dozen or so us would meet up for educational and social purposes. 
I spent a great deal of time with that painting. 
My ears would linger in the room with everyone else. 
But my eyes were on some possibly French beach. 
I got the impression it was French. 
I don't really know if that true.
The Couple in that painting stood on the beach in a dress and a suit that wasn't so good for bathing. 
Perhaps it was around winter and the Atlantic was much too cold for an enjoyable swim. 
I remember at fifteen it was the autumn of my youth. 
Right before winter when I had two jobs and was writing letters to a girl in Connecticut whom I met at funeral.
The Painting and I were getting along very well. 
I suppose I felt very mature--admiring art work that was popular enough to be sold on cheap poster board.
Until once in winter on a long day the painting was gone. 
I asked the young man who taught me about English if he'd seen it. 
He said he took it down. 
I expressed my dismay. 
I really liked that painting.
I know, he said. 
He shuffled some papers around.
“I just don’t know, Mrs. 
Hargood, Julie has never been problematic in the classroom. 
In fact she’s been quite the model little lady. 
Her finger paintings are just inspirational. 
And her attitude has never strayed from very attentive and curious—like any five year old should be.” Principal Krol looked over the file in front of her and adjusted her glasses. 
She pushed her glasses up her nose. 
She used her middle finger. 
Mrs. 
Hargood wore a look of mild concern. 
She had walked into the principal’s office that afternoon wearing the same look. 
She wore it the same way a widow wears black years after the fact of the funeral. 
“That may be true here, but at home I’ve heard just the foulest nonsense emanating from her mouth. 
Words I just can’t even repeat and strung together in a way that lacks both rhyme and reason. 
Do you think that maybe one of the other kids has been teaching bad words to my Julie?” Mrs. 
Hargood’s concern put on a black Sunday hat and matching veil. 
Principal Krol taps her sausage fingers on a large oak desk. 
She looks at the row of filing cabinets along the wall. 
On the wall there hung numerous awards the school had received from the state board of education, various parent groups, a framed photograph of the president. 
A couple of plaques. 
She sighs and turns her face down at her desk. 
“You see, that’s just the problem one has with trying to educate children nowadays. 
It’s like we can’t get to all of them before the television and the movies and that terrible internet. 
 The stuff some of them bring to class can be just mortifying—”
Mrs. 
Hargood’s concern watched as dirt filled a grave buried in her memory.
“—I don’t mean to alarm you, Mrs. 
Hargood. 
I just feel as though you ought to know the realities of the situation. 
It is quite possible that some other child learned a few new words from some movie or those awful videogames. 
Or even more common, their older siblings will bring words home that the children will imitate. 
You know how younger children like to imitate their elders.” Principal Krol shuffled her feet under her desk and looked over at the plastic potted plant in the corner. 
The plant looked like it needed watering. 
In the next room soft piano music permeated the walls. 
The tune was meandering around the scale like a drunken horse weaving down a cobblestone hill. 
Mrs. 
Hargood’s concern looked at Principal Krol with absolute bewilderment.
“Oh, Mrs. 
Hargood, that would be Ms. 
Pengrave.” She paused to confirm that Mrs. 
Hargood had never heard of her. 
“Ms. 
Pengrave is our new music teacher. 
She’s just wonderful with the children. 
The state sent her over to fill our legal requirement to employ a disabled person. 
Despite her disability, she manages quite well. 
And the children simply adore her. 
She’s been with us for some ten—“
“SSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHITPISS.” A young woman’s voice sang at the piano as if the piano was being chastised.
“—days…” Principal Krol felt Mrs. 
Hargood’s concern’s eyes widen. 
“What on earth was that noise?” Mrs. 
Hargood gripped her chair and swiveled her head around for signs of danger.
“Ms. 
Pengrave’s music is very modern. 
We understand that some parents would be rather concerned—naturally, of course—concerned that teaching music such as what you are hearing now is not of much good for the development of musical theory. 
However, Dr. 
Harris,” Principal Krol paused and nodded at Mrs. 
Hargood, “the state Psychologist, says that a new study shows that children exposed to music in this way develop strong senses of hearing. 
Dr. 
Harris says—“
“HORSSSSSSSSSECOCKBALLS.” Ms. 
Pengrave’s melody was completely indecipherable. 
Ms. 
Pengrave played the piano with sock puppets dressed as politicians that didn’t speak the same language engaging in a debate about the reality of class structure and the government’s involvement or lack thereof.
“—Dr. 
Harris says that early development should focus more on letting the children discover the notes on their own.” Principal Krol looked pleased with her herself. 
If she had a mirror, Principal Krol would look at herself looking pleased at Principal Krol.
Mrs. 
Hargood had to gather her thoughts for a moment. 
“FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUCKY. 
CUNT. 
CUNT, CUNT.” Ms. 
Pengrave delivered the last line of the song more like spoken word poetry.
Mrs. 
Hargood choked on nothing in particular. 
It was probably the air. 
I bet she choked on the air. 
“You said Ms. 
Pengrave is disabled?” She coughed a few more times to sure that the air was out of her throat.
“Yes, Mrs. 
Hargood, that’s correct. 
Ms. 
Pengrave is a disabled American. 
I can assure you that she’s a fully qualified and credentialed teacher. 
I have the paperwork right here if it would be of interest to you.” Principal Krol reached for a stack of papers at one end of the desk. 
The end closer to the thirstiest plant ever. 
“I don’t need to see the paperwork, thank you. 
But Principal Krol, what exactly—if you don’t mind my asking—is Ms. 
Pengrave’s disability?” 
Principal Krol pushed her glasses up her nose. 
“Oh. 
Why, Ms. 
Pengrave has Tourette’s syndrome. 
A most dreadful illness from what I’m told. 
Just imagine—all those tics.” She sighed and shook her head.
Mrs. 
Hargood shuffled in her seat, unsure of how to respond to such a situation.
The piano music carried on like a lost donkey trying to go for a late afternoon swim. 
There was a knock at the door.
“If you’ll excuse me,” said Principal Krol, “Come in!”
Standing in the doorway was a small child. 
Could be four, could be five.
“Yes Melissa, what is it?”
“Dickballs!” Melissa smiles.
The two women exchanged looks. 
It nice trade of facial expressions.
“Okay!” the little girl says. 
“bye bye!”
I drank gin because my father drank gin. 
My father drank gin because his father did. 
That’s all my grandfather left me; the herbal alcoholic sharp stench of gin. 
It lingered in the kitchen by the table, by his overcoat and night stand, in the empty glass next to the small framed photograph of my grandmother in a Sunday dress. 
The best black and whites money could buy. 
And now on my breath, off the ice in the glass on the bar top, from the bottles of Beefeater and Bombay. 
The glass is empty now and the bartender raises an eyebrow in inquiry. 
Perhaps another round? O solo mio? I think not, I’ve had enough, I’m good, just the tab please. 
I pay and tip, push the door open and hit the street, hit the concrete with my feet and walk. 
Gin was on my father’s breath, it came off in his pours, in his sweat. 
He breathed it on me when he said goodnight, it came off in his tears when my grandfather died. 
I can see it now in the vapor when I exhale into the night air. 
Feel it mix with the blood in my veins. 
Thin and pumping through my legs.
Counting the cracks in the concrete, one foot in front of the other, we’ve done this before. 
Step on a crack and break your mother’s back. 
But my mother was a whore. 
She blew the gas station attendant for a full tank. 
She blew the salesman for that set of encyclopedias she never read. 
She said they looked pretty on the shelves. 
Right next to the self help books she never read. 
The Harvard Classics with still crisp pages. 
Mother was more of a seven o’clock news girl. 
She drank rum. 
rum with cola, with coffee and milk, with ice. 
She’d drink with the news. 
Toast the newsman when he came on. 
She’d dress up in a skirt and a smart blouse, a fresh coat of makeup. 
By the time the cast wound down to the human interest piece she was slouched. 
Blouse down to precious few buttons, lip stick stained glass window licker. 
Dear ol’ Mom. 
Poor ol’ Dad. 
At least he had gin. 
Reliable and trustworthy gin. 
Gin that would always listen; gin that never let him down. 
 
I steadied the brick and mortar building next to me, somehow holding them both up with one hand. 
My knees buckle and I think maybe it’s me. 
Maybe all that damn gin was starting to take hold. 
I curse the English loudly. 
I curse Mom and Dad, the bartender, the bottle. 
The sidewalk is much closer now, each grain of concrete a pain a grain of sand in my eye. 
I’ve given up. 
I’m slack jawed, slack assed and half way out. 
And father had the nicest lips.
Things to do in San Francisco When You’re Alone.
Man, all these palm trees. 
I fuckin’ hate palm trees. 
But that’s the situation. 
Strange city, no direction, out bound not for a few more hours and a pocket full of other people’s dollars. 
Not that they’re stolen, I should clarify that. 
Not one to steal, but I borrow haphazardly. 
Sometimes it comes back on time. 
And sometimes, well you know… sometimes.
I sit on the dock watching crests peak in a harbor off some street I can’t remember. 
I sit leaning, looking out, light a cigarette and look for something to do. 
The salt water sea breeze blows the smoke right back. 
Lighting the damn thing was five kinds of a bitch.
I pick up and walk down a street past shops of all sorts. 
Past rows of people hocking bracelets. 
We share that bond. 
The seller and buyer. 
Whatever you need, man. 
Just give me twenty minutes. 
I heard of this place five blocks up but it turns out to be nine. 
Best cup of coffee in days; no fucking around. 
Someone is playing a piano on a second story. 
The notes bounce off parallel parked cars and down into my shoes; walking with rhythm. 
A nigger squirrel darts across the street in front, frantic fast rapid fire rodent. 
Urban tree rat. 
He’ll get hit by a mattress delivery truck within three days. 
No one will miss the nigger squirrel. 
Not even his nigger squirrel family. 
A human nigger is slouched in the doorway of a rundown theater, his breath is short gasps and he clutches a paper bag with a mostly empty bottle inside. 
He spits in it sometimes and drinks from it other times. 
He’s missing five teeth from the front of his mouth. 
His scouring pad hair is thin patchwork, showcasing discolored skin spots. 
He smells like he’s been pissing himself for the last week. 
His fingernails are chewed to the flesh and the dirt and shit and skin have built up underneath. 
 I walk on the other side of the street. 
A couple of queers pass by hand in hand. 
Later hand in ass pocket of all too tight jeans, cut off to reveal bronze smooth thighs. 
Muscles tight and toned. 
Sun bleached straight hair framing designer sunglasses. 
Just a couple of rich fags. 
Later on they’ll bump coke in the restroom of some swank night club that they complain about. 
Then they’ll suck each other off and rent a boy between them. 
In the morning one will awake facing the wall and feel sick every time he’s kissed. 
He’ll start getting irritated and yell. 
The other will not understand and start crying. 
Then they’ll make up and start fucking. 
And while the quiet one sleeps, the other will leave and get drunk.
I find a posh hotel and the ground floor bathroom, but there’s no bathtub, so I guess it’s just a restroom. 
I sit in the stall and roll a joint on top of the weekly paper. 
I smoke with my pants around my ankles, pushing out a shit from all too dry bowels, scratching my balls with the other hand. 
I read the paper and piss. 
The personal ads are boring. 
 The escort ads less so. 
I start touching my cock and get excited. 
A finger along the shaft and the blood starts rushing. 
My scrotum tightens. 
I dry rub my cock looking at an ad for spicy Latin girls. 
Punk rock prostitutes. 
Studded belts and ripped Dead Kennedy’s shirts, fuck me boots, tattoos and pierced clits, lips, rows of earrings and God fuck. 
Just fuck, oh fuck me. 
Semen starts soaking through the pages and I fold it, putting it on the floor.
I exit the stall with lazy bloodshot eyes and a mouth full of cotton balls. 
There is a row of sinks lining one of the walls. 
I bend forward and put my mouth to the faucet, drinking greedily. 
 A man in a blue tailored suit is washing his hands next to me. 
His two hundred dollar shoes clack on the crisp marble floor. 
He sees me and looks disgusted; he leaves. 
In the mirror my face is tired. 
My eyes half closed. 
The sensor perfect temperature water runs over my hands. 
I wash my face and towel dry. 
Feeling much more alive now, awake and clean and empty of unnecessaries. 
The street again and cigarette to lips. 
Lighter to cigarette, smoke in, smoke out and sigh. 
I hunger and everything smells like food. 
Like chink noodle shops and spic taco hole in the wall joints, sea food chowder and some Thai place with an unpronounceable name. 
There’s a deli up the street with fist sized stacks of meat between thin slices of sourdough. 
It seems just right until I realize it’s full of kikes. 
Shylock hook-nosed green shit-faced kikes. 
The sandwich is worth about three dollars less than I pay. 
There’s a cup of coffee and a bag of over salted chips thrown in. 
Refills are half the price of a fresh cup. 
Fuckin’ kikes. 
I loosen my belt a notch and tighten my shoes. 
There’s a bus bench to sit on and smoke. 
I lit up and a fairy with limp wrists and a tank top asks for a spare with flamboyant lisping lips. 
I hand him one and he tries talking to me. 
I tell him to fuck off and take a long drag. 
He floats away making conversation with himself. 
A chain of young girls in pleated skirts pass by, giggling like a flock of jailbait butterflies. 
I scratch at my crotch, freeing the sack from the space next to my leg where it was sticking. 
A fat girl in all black with a Linkin Park backpack waddles by with her pants riding up her ass. 
Spiked belt muffining her belly over the edge.
I have seen the gentrification of punk rock culture. 
I have read bestsellers of shock jock pop culture plastic wrapped piss fiction. 
I’ve met shysters and charlatans, sinners and shit talkers that make millions. 
I’ve seen the split second attention deficit party prose play out over the earphones and dance floors of America. 
I’ve seen communication turn into a convenience. 
Faith turn into a mark of stupidity. 
And somewhere along the line life became expensive. 
Somehow survival became a charity operation for anyone that lacked the balls to break a few necks. 
I’ve witnessed the new labels. 
The rehashing of of old ones. 
The new hippies, the new hipsters, the punkers, the rockers, the hicks and rednecks. 
The queer culture, the drug culture, the kids that define their lives by musical tastes. 
I’ve seen blind faith go hand in hand with right wing extremist politics. 
People convincing themselves that loving means hating. 
That saving people means submission. 
That sex without love is fucking and that’s just fine. 
And slut is just a word that jealous people use. 
This pervasive, perverse feeling that it’s all been done before and all we have left are post modern retro revivals. 
Even those are sold in specialty shops. 
Shops with prewrinkled, ripped jeans that sell for two hundred and fifty dollars a pair.
A hooker sits across the street facing me, legs uncrossed. 
Blood red lips and black eye liner, short skirt and shaven pussy. 
 An Asian girl with thick black rimmed glasses, lotus tattoo on her right sleeve and a well worn CBGB shirt clings to her perked, petite breasts walks behind sending a text message. 
I flick the butt burned to the filter into an already littered street. 
I get up, blink and walk down the street reading graffiti. 
I walk down the hill back to the pier. 
There’s a black man playing guitar and tapping a tambourine with his feet. 
He sings nonsense poems to no one and everyone, picking a melody out with his thick fingers. 
His hat sits next to him full of spare change. 
There are people painting portraits and caricatures. 
Sea scenes and sidewalk art. 
Kiosks selling hotdogs and clam chowder. 
Knick-knacks and souvenirs; trinkets. 
I find a quiet spot on a dock, light another and count five left. 
I’ve still got an hour. 
There’s a pair of shoes passed out in the shadows. 
I face the water watching the yachts, and a tour boat blows the horn while people with foreign accents cheer, making their way to the bridge.
I woke up and coughed until my throat was a dessert. 
I coughed the sand of my lungs until the blood rained into the kitchen sink. 
My gums spat blood on the counter. 
My nostrils bleed by my breathing. 
Scabs on my arms made me scratch. 
My skin gave way, preferring to leave as soon as possible. 
I ran fingers through my hair and came away with enough to make a false beard. 
The coughing continued. 
I boiled salt water, thinking some ancient medical text advised gargling in times like these. 
I tried three times only to purge the water I could stomach back into the sink. 
My finger nails were caked with dead skin and dried blood. 
My teeth ached in an abandoned way. 
Once pearly, now orphans with empty stomachs in the emergency room of my mouth. 
Sitting like aged granite tombstones in the desolate cemetery of my face.
Showering only chased off the hair that was on the way out. 
Stuck looking for a coat and hat at the door of my head. 
The welts and boils on my skin would grow hard. 
The blisters would be white under their domes of dead skin, awaiting rupture from the prison of puss.
My eyes now swollen and bloodshot puffed around and dry. 
There was nothing left for them. 
No amount of plaster on the wall seemed intricate enough, no ceiling puzzle pattern mind's eye maze uncharted.
I looked again at my hands. 
Once I thought my hands were quite lovely. 
So nice and skillful. 
Now, name a disease. 
Give me a skin condition and I will give you a picture of my hands. 
You will find what you're looking for.
I look down as I lay in bed. 
My ribcage is center stage. 
Jutting forth in four part harmony, the absence of Eve and what a waste I’ve become. 
I tell Eve she never was much good to me anyway. 
To hell with apples. 
I'm on a grain based diet. 
I don't know how to get to sleep anymore. 
I lost the map. 
I no longer get up to piss; the bed is just big enough that I don't have to lie in it. 
I swallow air in place of food and I feel as though my throat is three time the size of my neck. 
I breathe dust instead of air.
I eat my own fingernails for food. 
When I run out of liquids to drink, I’ll just swallow and hope for the best. 
Sometimes the bottle is empty and I stick my cock inside and pretend I piss single malt twenty-five year old scotch. 
Aged to perfection. 
Sometimes I see the sun rise, and sometimes it's dark for a while. 
Sometimes I think there's a reason to get up, but that's just my imagination. 
Sometimes I imagine something better than this. 
But I know that's only a lie. 
I've got them all beat. 
I've won the race. 
The finish line is right up ahead and the ref is pointing his pistol straight up to the sky. 
He's aiming for my soul. 
He has eyes just like yours and the same expression of calculated indifference.
Blind. 
Velcro. 
Scavenger. 
Plunger. 
Limp.
The mouse traps were in full effect. 
All bait laden and set. 
Springs at the ready, full of tension, beckoning, inviting, seductive. 
The mice were in the hall, under the trash cans and rarely around. 
Their relation to the traps was an orbiting curiosity and cautious dance of calculated proportions. 
The blind man sat in a chair with a Velcro grin, lips parting in dehydrated fashion, stuck together and peeled apart like the first pair of shoes to be worn on day one of grade school when some scavenger immigrant family moves to Los Angles for the first time with their first generation American children, waiting for the under the table maintenance jobs, house cleaning, housekeeping, tile laying landscaping manual labor plumber on the weekends to keep the Tapatio bottle full bullshit work that white people refuse to do anymore. 
The blind man looks at the traps in an audio not so much visual way. 
He observes his traps and waits with all the patience of a vulture circling high above a stranded hiker wandering the deserts just past the grand canyon, wondering where exactly the rest of the tour went off to after he limped off to piss into the river. 
The mice have heard stories, scattered over generations. 
Tall tales mentioned in passing between old rats and grandfather mice with patchy fur and geriatric paws, chipped incisors and flea problems. 
There are traps, they’d say. 
There are traps with riches beyond comprehension, full of all the wonders of old milk fat, harden by years of careful negligence, aged to perfection in the basements of ancient Frenchmen, stacked and labeled and forgotten by the cellar door of a strega nonna somewhere in Tuscany. 
But be not deceived by the smells and sights of so much cheese. 
Before a bite can be bitten, before a morsel can be moved, a snap, a clap and a broken neck and never to return. 
Only a twitch, an exhale forced, and only a limp left if you’re lucky enough. 
There was a time before when the eyes still worked and the old man went on house calls for sixty dollars an hour to the bored house wives of America. 
He would stroke his plunger and ease the flow of his words to scavenger scraps of unused vaginal tracts for his own amusement. 
There was a time before the blindness when his own plumbing worked like the aqueduct archetypes’ of their roman predecessors. 
But now there was his mice and the traps. 
The satisfying snaps and screams of wrong way greedy eyed rodents caught between a mold and a latch.
Sunday of my youth meant church and the functions there of. 
Sunday did not mean breakfast. 
Sunday for my youth meant a nine a.m. 
curtain call with all the priests and accoutrements that services provided. 
But then I became a man and put away childish things and then Sunday meant brunch or lazy sex in the afternoon. 
Le Petit Mort between the sheets of a shack in middle of downtown. 
Slow rising, hard up and hard on and rock on top of me because I’m still half away and you must have all the motivation of wanting one more fling at the thing we like to call sex. 
Thank god for you and the communion between your legs. 
That’s the kind of breakfast I can really get behind. 
That’s the kind of hindquarter headlong give me head to finish and thrust away to a few seconds of scatterbrained euphoric why are you still here and what I really mean is good morning kind of day. 
Sunday is perfect for eggs, but certainly not the kind all up in your uterus. 
Not so good fried, but neither am I, so I’m pretty sure we can compromise. 
We can lay lazy for a while and wait until one of our phones rings. 
When the sound comes it will be vexing and welcome, like the neighbor that lacks timing or common courteously, because we’re neighbors and he thinks that means he’s always welcome despite company and circumstances and maybe he needs a cup of sugar or some toilet paper but I haven’t bothered with pants and she hasn’t bothered to clean what could have been our children from her thigh, the creamy untouched by sun milky white that would grace so many bowl of cereal consumed after church on so many Sundays of my childhood. 
In the parking lot of lost ambitions she stalls the motor of the used car that ambled up the hills and valleys of a place we used to call home. 
In the dusk light she gives up on cranking the key one more time and looks over at the passenger seat where I sit staring ahead and not bothering with eye contact on a such a tedious night for conversation. 
Afraid that she might try and coax some kind of current state of affairs piece out of me, that I might be tired enough to speak like I cared enough to tune her out so that she’d still be pretty enough to kiss goodnight after all was said and I was done and we could be go home and not think about each other and what that means and whatever may come and as long as I do, I don’t really care. 
Your mouth or my hand, or your hand. 
Either way, I’ll be there, coming ‘round the mountain.
The passenger door has had issues with me for a while and the lightbulb above the center console refuses to dim enough to be sexually satisfying. 
I eye the light squinting sideways and scowl at the bulb that bares the facial expressions between us, laying on the table all the emotions that make up a noncommittal, whiskey fueled reckless abandon bumper car kind of relationship that you never bought a ticket for in the first place. 
Some how you ended up in line and then in the drivers seat and then everyone just took turns slamming into you and no one wanted to take responsibility for the years of chiropractic care resulting from repeated bumps and jostled and whiplash and all you wanted was a ride home and by you I mean me, because I don’t know what the fuck you’re thinking about, but I have an idea telegraphed by the light bulb that refuses to turn off despite my firmly closing the passenger side door and waiting for you to pull up to my house.
Over the mountains and down in the valley. 
Lyrics to a song I heard while mom cleaned the house back in the days of bright neon day glo kmart clothing line but still second hand because it was one of those kinds of things. 
Over and under and upside down like the jungle gym metal pipe hanging around monkeybar work out programs design for more limber children with bright future of being molested by coaches with Olympic dreams never achievable on their own means due to age. 
Over and down just like giving up, quitting, throwing in the towel soaked with beer because matt knocked over the coffee table because he has a weight problem. 
Not that he’s fat or anything. 
More so we just have a light table without so much a sturdy base line and it’s fairly easy to upset. 
Over and over and over like repetition and patterns and a.d.d and
She wore black and clad in stockings and mascara and dyed hair and dead to the world because nine inch nails gave me a manicure. 
She was one of those after school special dropout strip mall victims with razor burned lips and razor blade scars on her arms and a razor blade suitcase album tucked into her record collection. 
She liked anal and I liked her for the novelty of the whole idea. 
She would ask me to bite her and she would say harder. 
She wanted blood, mostly hers and enough to make it visible and poignant. 
She was a drama queen in the sense that she graduated high school as the president of the thespian society. 
Long black hair that slacked off in perpetual apathy outside the window of her Volkswagen. 
She was one of those girls. 
A pout you could rest a stack of seventeen magazines on. 
All the eyeshadow of Gary Glitter and David Bowie caked on like a shield from the cheery happy go lucky we can do anything and accomplishments are yours for the taking mentality of the 90s coupled with bitter optimism and bandwagon nonchalance. 
She liked a good slap on the face or the ass. 
She didn’t see much difference. 
She had a thing for gluttonous fellatio, enough to choke on and enough to make her vomit just enough to coat my cock before she could finger force a few inches into her rectum. 
She was one of those girls.
The toilet bowl is a place for collections. 
A rich cornucopia of feces and urinal tract marks and misplaced bad aim a few too many cans of cheap piss water near beer birthmarks on that can we know and love. 
A picture paints a thousand words but a stain holds a few hundred stories. 
Some hilarious, some depressing, most of them bullshit, or shitty attempts at immortality just because something vulgar happened this one time that makes you john fucking grisham. 
Good luck with that you fucking pervert. 
By the way, p.s. 
postscript, ad nauseum, addendum, aside, footnote, see chapter entitled “things I did to the walls of your shower while you will still sleeping part four.” Here’s a hint. 
I painted the sombitch. 
I spread my seed by the wayside of the walls where you bathe and frankly my little whore, I don’t give a rat’s ass. 
How’s that for stains?
I could go on about the current state of your couch. 
But I’m a  ice guy. 
And we don’t have to go there.
The vag. 
The vagoo. 
The hole the abyss. 
A place to put your peter. 
A warm outlet and instep for the dance of a thousand thrusts. 
Or at least a few minutes. 
The womb, the first home. 
The squish where once birthed you long to return as long as possible and linger to plunge the improbable depths but no matter what you seek death not six feet but six inches deep and that’s enough to go on. 
So there you have it. 
The vagina. 
Something or other about this or that. 
A subtraction problem where my penis is a minus and all that’s left is the remainder and long division is completely out of the question. 
Oh, there’s something you should know. 
A point I make and break the silence of so many mornings and mourning’s like funerals where deep in the earth we sink another coffin and coughing roommates mucus makes it’s way to the trash cans like corpses making albums destined for the used record stores of so many sidewalk sales and into the great vag we plunge to unclog the mind and clear the head and the little head spurts to leave us panting and gasping and dying inside because it was just a fluke and  either of us meant to be there at the time. 
It was just a mistake. 
You have to believe me. 
But still, you should douche that demon, you smell like a fish market that’s been out of operation for a decade since the maintenance crew went on strike due to union issues and health problems and everyone else has just been avoiding the place because of bad juju and bad publicity and ghost stories about phantom cocks that haunt the caverns of the space between the legs you use to get from a to b and now all that’s left is a void where I can hear my echo if I scream a tongue twister loud enough. 
But that’s the past and this is the present and for Christmas all I wanted was one more dive off the deep end into the hole I used to call home and you would knock on wood and let me in and then together we could reinact the beast with two backs t hat brought us here in t he first place. 
And fuck your fanstasies, because that’s beautiful.
Humanity has been in need for decades. 
There’s a whole organization devoted to the idea. 
They’re called habitat for humanity and they must be as silly as the rest of us. 
 A habitat. 
A home a place to stop and kick off the shoes you should be wearing a contributing member of society. 
But no matter if you lack shoes. 
Not that the habitat for humanity can provide them for you. 
But fuck those guys. 
As if they know. 
If you have time to be a part of an organization that builds homes, you must have one enough for yourself. 
If you have the kind of time needed to build a habitat for humanity, that I mean goddamn. 
Once upon a time there was a sign, now stolen by your’s truly, that stated Habitat restoration in progress. 
The sign was on a fence in a lagoon where once I stared at the stars with a shell shocked girl with a  warm bed and hot chocolate late night conversation. 
A lagoon where I was busted by the cops in the company of three underage girls and a half case of the finest Mexican beer money could buy. 
But the sign still lingers, announcing to all oncomers the current state of the place I like to live. 
The current state is and will always be, in progress. 
A never to be complete kind of operation. 
I’m sure that sign was meant in similar vain. 
I’m pretty sure that section of forest wasn’t going to grow back any faster. 
But the sign is gone and that’s as done as it’s going to get. 
Nature will take it’s sweet ass time and I will take my sweet ass sign.
Solamente o solo mio the drum solo beat down beat off beets for dinner kind of summer dream. 
Flying solo, cockpit like you’ve never seen before, not even in the movies, baby. 
Alone is a way of going solo and being independent and it’s all me and all or nothing and my own two feet and nothing else because really that’s all I’ve got. 
You ever been stranded without a care or a ticket or a pass or direction for your erection and that’s all there is to it. 
Spiraling downward into reckless, neck-less like the fat from a chin making headway into the belly of a back problem handicapped slumped into himself, folding into bulbous extension of a transubstantiated stomach problem.
Around this time of year you’ll wonder how cloth can get so cold. 
If you stepped outside right now your breath would be a plume of steam. 
There should be snow on the ground; it should always be overcast and around twenty degrees. 
But since you live on the coast, and since you’re not that far north, it might as well be autumn. 
Mind you, it’s still freezing. 
Mind you, it’s still too cold for a swim. 
That’s what time of year it is. 
Around December twenty-third. 
Give or take a few hours. 
You haven’t bothered to start December twenty-third, and neither has this girl that lives in a studio down off Ocean Street. 
She has no desire to open her eyes when they do. 
She has no inclination whatsoever to get out of bed. 
Half open eyes peer up at the ceiling, at the chipped paint and plaster walls. 
She pulls the blankets tighter and turns on her side, going fetal. 
The heater hasn’t been working for the last week. 
The landlord hasn’t done a damn thing about it. 
Shivering, the girl tries to find some kind of warmth between layers of blankets. 
An alarm clock makes some noise; an old clock radio with big knobs to control the frequency and volume. 
She slaps the snooze button habitually. 
 She rolls over to her other side and tries to shut her eyes again. 
 In the apartment above her she can hear the couple getting up. 
Someone is yelling “God damn it!” repeatedly. 
There’s a loud thump and a woman is crying. 
Then footsteps. 
A door opens and slams shut. 
More footsteps. 
The crying turns into sobbing and our girl downstairs drifts off to sleep. 
The clock radio buzzes back to life a while later. 
From beneath the covers, her hand emerges and slaps hard on top of it. 
The noise from the radio is replaced by sounds from upstairs. 
The crying has transformed into moaning and rhythmic bumps; squeaks from a box frame and heavy breathing. 
Resigned to being awake, the girl’s eyes are open now. 
Hair shimmers around her on the pillow like a frozen splash of cranberry juice. 
If eyes were scents, she would see the world through freshly baked bread. 
A yawn escapes longwinded, stretching her face out of sleep. 
Her legs slide to the side and out, off the bed. 
She wraps herself in the blankets and shuffles to the bathroom. 
The water faucet turns on and she waits until the temperature is right to wash her face. 
She studies the mirror looking for changes, checking to see what needs to be done.
The door upstairs opens and slams shut. 
Now three people are yelling. 
Sometimes they take turns, other times their voices collide and weave themselves into nonsense. 
A woman screams, “You fucking bastard!” And a man responds with a series of shut ups. 
Sometimes he says shut the fuck up. 
Downstairs, the girl in the mirror rolls her eyes. 
All she has to say is “Jesus Fucking Christ.” She says it to her reflection and she says it softly. 
She brushes her teeth and brushes her hair and lets the blankets fall around her feet. 
She stands in a sweater and sweat pants. 
Her long cranberry juice hair is stranded in various spots around her sweater and the blankets. 
She plucks her eye brows, creating perfect symmetry. 
Her nose wrinkles and she squints at herself. 
She smiles and carries the blankets back to her bed, throwing them in a pile on top. 
In the closet she finds a fresh sweater, a pair of jeans, a shirt. 
The clothes she wears are replaced piece by piece until she feels complete. 
The old clothes are tossed as they come off, landing on the bed and the floor. 
A pair of socks, a pair of shoes, her purse, her phone, keys. 
A lighter and three cigarettes. 
She touches up her lips and eyes. 
The eye liner and lipstick, careful not to get any on her teeth, careful to make sure everything is perfect. 
She smiles at herself as soon as she feels everything has been done. 
She has a smile like the first pull of beer after a long day’s work. 
She puts her emerald coat on, the one that brings out her eyes. 
Buttoning it right up to the neck, she checks the apartment one last time and locks the door behind her. 
The street is crisp. 
The pavement is chilled; the air can cut through any amount of wool. 
Scarves, hats, gloves, stockings, anything to add another layer. 
Anything to block that awful cold out. 
Breathing in smoke helps. 
Breathing in hot nicotine always helps. 
She puts a cigarette to her lips. 
A baby blue Bic is produced and flicked. 
The flame hits the tip making a cherry, starting a spark, setting a fire. 
She inhales deep and exhales slow into the noon day sun, mixing the smoke with the fog of her breath. 
She aims her body at Water Street, cutting down the sidewalk in a pair of maroon Converse high-tops. 
Her phone has been silent all morning and this is a bad sign. 
No news is neglectful news. 
She is being left out. 
But she refuses to initiate. 
People have to come to her. 
Only come to her if you have something to offer. 
Standards are high. 
They have to be. 
There are too many people looking for a hand out, for a free ride, a free lunch, or a hand up. 
Those people need to help themselves, she figures. 
This world is a cruel bitch, and Mother Nature is an indifferent bitch of a mother. 
But that’s fine. 
Two can play that game. 
She flicks the cigarette butt into a bush and blows out a last cloud. 
She takes Water to Front Street, Front to Pacific Avenue. 
She passes people still sleeping. 
Large lumps of blankets scattered on benches by the river, hunched over in the alcoves of buildings. 
Under bushes and bus stops. 
Sometimes a face breaks loose. 
The faces are all the same. 
Unwashed, unshaven, sun tanned and ridden with scars. 
The eyes are always sharp and desperate. 
One can only pull a coat so close, and your own arms only hold you so tight. 
The closer she gets to downtown, the more intense the scents change. 
Early afternoon exhaust, the cafes in full grind. 
Coffee and pedestrians, car fumes and bums. 
The public service workers are just finishing cleaning the streets, picking up her cigarette butts from last night. 
Picking up the cellophane wrappers, receipts, and waste of every night’s parade. 
A small Hispanic woman sweeps broken glass into a large metal dust pan. 
She sweeps it out from the doorway of one of the bars and into a trash can. 
Broken glass falls on broken glass. 
A jack hammer hums and pounds away in the background. 
Middle aged women in groups of two pass by with shopping bags. 
Families pass by with paper cups and plastic lids. 
She counts seven people playing guitars and singing, mostly to themselves. 
Two of them are singing Bob Dylan songs. 
One of them is a girl with short brown hair and a newsboy cap. 
She wears a long, dark blue skirt and a faded grey cardigan. 
She’s singing The Times They Are a Changin’ with passionate understanding. 
She can’t be more than twenty. 
For all her effort she gets a shiny quarter. 
The quarter is dropped on bended knee. 
It lands on a bed of nickels and dimes. 
The girls smile at each other and nod. 
Thanks for something. 
Thanks for trying. 
Thanks for singing along. 
A man leaves a group of other men standing a circle, conversing. 
He leaves and hurries after the girl walking down the street.
“Baby girl!” He says. 
“Hey Baby!” But she’s so used to that.
“Hey Baby, how you been? Remember me from the other night? We talked for two hours and you took all my smokes.”
“Oh,” she says, “Oh, hi James.”
“Jake.” He says.
“Jake, right.”
“I tried calling you the other night, where’ve you been?”
“Oh, you know, out and about.” She keeps walking and he walks beside her.
“I never seen you since Baby, where you gotta be that’s better than around me?”
“With friends, you know.” She keeps her cool; she keeps her eyes ahead of her.
“You must have some interesting friends.”
“Lots.”
“I’m sure. 
Listen, hey, not so fast. 
Whatcha doin’ tonight?”
“I’ll be some place, call me.”
“Sure.” He says. 
“Bye.”
She walks on and he stands there, shaking his head. 
He’s going to call her, but she’s not going to pick up.
She turns into a wooden doorway and walks up to the counter of a coffee shop. 
A long wooden bar stretches down most of the length of the place. 
The smells of fresh ground, roasted espresso beans waft about. 
Hints of chocolate and toasted bagels. 
Milk is steamed, coffee percolates. 
Conversations come and go while students tick away at laptops. 
There are tables, there are chairs. 
There’s some old lady erasing a crossword puzzle.
“Abby! Good morning sweetheart, how are you?”
“Oh God, I’m glad to see you. 
I just ran into that awful guy from last week.”
“The one with the argyle sweater and shiny shoes? What was so bad about him?”
“That was his friend; I’m talking about the blond with the gap tooth. 
He’s just so fucking obnoxious.”
“Oh yeah. 
He was terrible. 
Why the hell did you give him your number anyway?”
“Drank too much and wasn’t thinking. 
Maybe he’ll be good for something some time.” She shrugs, “Anyways, spare something hot for a cold girl to drink?”
“A little mocha for a little lady? I think I can do that, hold on.”
Behind the counter, the drink is prepared. 
She gets out the chocolate, steams the milk, presses the espresso and everything finds a way into a paper cup.
“Whipped cream, mayhaps?” The coffee shop girl inquires, “Sprinkles? Chocolate shavings? Nutmeg? Cinnamon?”
“No, no thanks. 
Not today. 
This is perfect.” Abby tries to takes a short sip, blowing over the top of the cup in between attempts.
“Well, now what are you up to?”
“I’m not really sure yet. 
I think I just want to walk for a while.”
A young couple is standing behind Abby, looking over the drink menu hung up behind the counter. 
They hold each other around the waist and talk in low voices. 
The boy is wearing a long brown coat and a department store clearance rack shirt. 
It’s decent enough for church on Sundays; it even has buttons. 
The shirt is complimented by some well worn tennis shoes and faded blue jeans. 
The girl is standing in black polyester pants and sheep skin slippers. 
She has a hooded sweater on that’s a few sizes too big for her petite frame. 
Her hair is tied in a pony tail of golden brunette strands. 
They’re being cute together and Abby can feel it over her shoulder. 
“I should get going. 
Thanks for the coffee, Love. 
Call me later, let’s get a drink.”
“Any time Abs, I’ll call you. 
Love.”
The girls wave goodbye and smile at each other. 
The couple steps up to the counter and the barista greets them, inquiring about their purchase. 
The girl clings to the boy and doesn’t speak to anyone else. 
Her face is half buried in his chest. 
He begins;
“Umm, I’ll take a large black coffee and she’ll have a small soy chai. 
To go please. 
Thanks.”
The financial aspect of the transaction is taken care of; the boy pays for everything. 
Abby hears the register close and closes the door behind her. 
Back on the sidewalk, back past the shops the shoppers and panhandlers. 
She can hear a fiddler about a block and a half away. 
A man plays conga drums in a steady rhythm, never wavering from the same beat. 
A family of four passes by, three children and a mother. 
Mom has circles under her eyes, her cheeks are sunken and near skeletal. 
The children pester her for ice cream, chocolate things and toys. 
She looks like she could leave them in a store somewhere. 
She could send them off to look at things and turn right around and go back out that door. 
She could get in the car and drive. 
She’d drive south until the gas tank was full of fumes. 
She’d find a filling station and wash the windshield, maybe get an oil change and a full tank. 
And then South. 
South until everything felt okay again. 
The kids would find a way. 
Someone that likes kids would take care of them. 
They’re some decent people left in the world. 
There’s someone somewhere that still cares about other people’s children. 
Abby fumbles in her purse for a new cigarette, leaving one left. 
One last cigarette means a trip to the corner store. 
That means a friendly exchange with the mustache guy that never leaves the counter. 
Mustache guy with a baseball cap and a smile. 
Abby puts on a smile of her own. 
The door is already open. 
The rows and rows of alcohol in glass and plastic bottles stand neatly around the walls. 
Shelves of snacks and other beverages fill up most of floor space. 
A fine layer of dust has settled on everything except the floor between the door and the register.
“Oh, hello Abby! Merry Christmas.” Each word is filtered through his full black broom of a moustache. 
The hairs are long enough to cover his lower lip when his mouth is closed.
“Hey, how are you?”
“I’m well, I’m well. 
Pack of filters?”
“Yeah, thanks and also, could I get that small bottle of Jameson? Not the shot, the next one up. 
The flasky one.”
“A little something for your coffee? Any plans for Christmas? See your family?”
“I don’t think so, no. 
I don’t really want to. 
I’m not really feeling it this year. 
I can’t stand buying things for people.”
“I see.”
“How about you?” She says handing him a five dollar bill.
“Working. 
Working all the time. 
It’s just another Tuesday.” He hands her two dimes and three pennies.
“Yeah, I know what you mean.” She pauses. 
“Well, thanks again. 
Take care of yourself.”
“I will, I will. 
You too. 
Thanks again Abby. 
Bye.”
Abby places the whiskey in her purse. 
She taps the pack of cigarettes on the counter twice and puts them in as well. 
She turns and walks back out the doorway. 
At the intersection she looks in each direction. 
She could back track. 
She could cross a bridge and make a loop. 
She could wander up to Mission Street and poke around up there. 
Or she could keep on walking to the beach. 
Abby continues on Pacific, past the last line of shops. 
Past the house of cards, the magic shop and the car dealer. 
Past the block of apartments and the bike shop. 
The taco place on the hillside and then it flattens out. 
Then you can see the wharf stretching into the sea. 
You can see the Boardwalk and Casino. 
The Casino that’s really an arcade. 
A large room filled with children dropping quarters into slots. 
A room full of colorful, flashing lights and mechanical carnival noise.
Abby drinks her coffee. 
She cuts across the street towards the small café on the corner before the wharf starts. 
A man is sitting down at the patio furniture in front. 
A cup steams in front of him and he smokes slowly, resting in the sunlight shoved between cracks in the clouds. 
There’s a book open in front of him and a hat on the table. 
His feet are resting on the chair next to him. 
The soles of his shoes are almost worn through. 
He looks up at Abby as she walks by. 
He looks her up and down and looks at her face, hoping and waiting for her to turn and acknowledge him. 
Abby walks by and notes him peripherally. 
His eyes linger on the door as it closes.
The girl behind this counter is standing poised. 
Her right arm is bent with her wrist behind her head. 
There’s a stack of quarters on her elbow. 
In one swift motion she flings her hand down, pivoting on her shoulder. 
There’s a sound of loose change flying against the wall and a few landing in her hand. 
“Ah shit, a dollar short!” She catches Abby looking at her. 
“Oh Jesus, sorry about that. 
What can I getcha?” She hops behind the register and brightens up a little. 
Her eyes are soft and light green. 
Her hair is curly, dirty blond. 
She stands all in black, at the ready to brew something or scoop some ice cream. 
“Umm, just a bottle of water. 
What was that you were doing when I came in?”
“Oh, that? I was trying to beat the Fonz’s record. 
The Fonz could catch eight dollars in six stacks off his elbow. 
Someday I’m going to get nine.” She beams.
“What’s your record so far?” Abby cracks a smile.
“Oh, well just now I’m up to two dollars in four stacks, up a dollar from yesterday.” She pulls a bottle of water from the cooler behind her.
Abby laughs a little, “That’s pretty cool. 
At this rate you’ll make eight by New Years.”
“Yeah, yeah I hope so.” She looks pensively at nothing in particular. 
Then snapping back to attention, “It’s a buck fifty for the water.”
Abby digs out some change and a dollar bill. 
“Sorry I don’t have many quarters, but maybe I’ll come back with some later.”
“That’d be awesome, thanks.”
“I’ll do what I can. 
Thanks for the water.”
“Anytime. 
It’s kinda my job.” Her eyes are bright and sincere. 
She smiles without showing any teeth. 
She begins searching for the stray quarters as soon as Abby turns around.
Abby walks outside past the guy at the table. 
He’s reading now and leaning back, resting the spine of the book against the edge of the table. 
Abby can read Hesse but nothing else. 
The guy looks up and catches her trying to read the title. 
Abby turns quickly and walks toward the wharf. 
Her shoes hit pavement then wood. 
She lights her third cigarette of the day. 
She inhales deep into her diaphragm and exhales with a sigh. 
She walks all the way to the end of the wharf, sipping on her bottle of water and smoking. 
She leans against the railing, looking out across the water. 
The ocean stretches on and on. 
Blue and white break. 
Patches of seaweed and kelp. 
Abby removes the bottle of whiskey and puts the water away. 
She takes a long pull and swallows. 
She coughs lightly and takes one last drag of her cigarette, flicking the butt as far as she can. 
The bottle goes up again to her lips and she drinks. 
The sea lions are barking at each other. 
A few boats float around. 
The whiskey burns down her throat, into her guts. 
Fuel for the machine. 
And in Abby’s purse her phone rings. 
When you describe someone like a doll, you infer smooth skin and delicate features. 
Perhaps a fragile smile or a look or porcelain indifference. 
The eyes could be flat and hard like river rocks or a prismatic well returning in echoes the kinds of things only meant to be whispered into subterrainian water sources.
I couldn't sleep so well. 
Rest came reluctantly in short bursts of shut eye. 
I dreamed about the doll sleeping next to me. 
She had a way of existing in an adorable manner. 
Even her snoring made me smile. 
While she slept and I couldn't, I would look her over. 
Not thinking that I was unreasonably lucky or wondering how this came about or what had I done to deserve this. 
I adored in the simple beauty she lived in.
Her short black hair takes an hour to make right. 
She has a recipe she's kept for years. 
The process is very specific. 
There are steps and certain procedures. 
She does this ritual with her hair every morning.
My favorite part of this whole process starts around nine or ten in the morning. 
Right after she wakes up for the first time. 
Her hair has started a riot. 
Certain strands are staging a protest. 
Others are marching on city hall with torches. 
Her scalp is Catholic but her hair is protestant. 
The IRA has set up shop in her eye brows.
She shifts her lithe dancer's body on leopard print sheets. 
I hold her close with an arm like a paper clip, keeping my records together. 
My other arm is under her pillow and my hand is riot control, combing through the madness of her hair.
She opens an eye at the mirror on the wall next to us. 
For a minute half of my face and half of her's are visible. 
Mine rising like a harvest moon over a field of snow resting on her skin. 
All I can do is kiss her cheek and smile. 
She has that kind of effect on me.
She's the kind of girl that asks, "Well, now what should we do” and I'll say, "Let's get a twelve pack of cheap beer and go to the ocean." And she'll ask, "Should we buy cigarettes too?"
She says she's crazy but she's never been too unreasonable for me. 
She says she's crazy but I don't think she's so bad. 
She says she's crazy but I say she makes more sense to me than most people.
I've seen her cry and her make up is a high tide flood water mascara river running down her cheeks and she coughs and shoots another shot of bourbon down.
I've seen her look right through me, the wall behind me, all the buildings in town. 
I wonder what she's looking at. 
I think it must be the ocean.
When the doll maker formed her, he carved her eyes out of ocean water and took snow to mold her face. 
Her hair was imported from Ireland. 
It was made from the ashes of a church that used to stand somewhere around Cork County. 
The doll maker found a creek near an old whiskey distillery. 
He took that creek and fashioned it into her smile. 
To make her body, the doll maker went to an old ballroom with high chandeliers, dusty from years of hanging around. 
He found the music resting in the walls, antique acoustics and echoes from a time of dance cards and gowns that turned women into waltzing waterfalls. 
He formed her body from that music. 
Her bones were made from marble taken from the tombstones in cemeteries that make nice places to take a break on long, intoxicated walks home at just before dawn when the first autumn rains are squeezed from the grey sponges in the sky. 
The fire of her spirit was taken from the brutal forges of hell. 
Stolen while Satan was sleeping off a mean hangover.
He made her voice by taking the reflecting of a full moon off a lake, frozen over in a time long past when Vikings prepared for Valhalla by sharpening their axes and feeding the remains of their enemies to wolves.
She gets out of bed and stretches her perfection towards heaven, mocking angels and the image of god. 
Making a shape from the entirety of her being that reminds of me of watching honey drip off a recently dipped strawberry. 
She looks at me looking at her in a way that says, "You're very sweet, but I’m crazy and I will destroy you."
I look at her and try to say, "You're not so bad, and I appreciate your continued existence. 
Please continue."
She disappears for a few minutes, finding water before huddling next to me again. 
The warmth of her body is hot chocolate on the winter night of my childhood. 
Her kiss is a good hot toddy on a cold night after a long day of work. 
She makes me forget which one of us is sweet and which one of us is crazy. 
She demands nothing of me and I demand nothing of her. 
We laugh easy and always right on time. 
She doesn’t seem to mind my outbursts of pent up affection. 
Sometimes sadness sneaks up on her and all I want to do is take her sadness and put it in a bottle, throw that bottle off a cliff and watch it float away on the waves of her eyes. 
Hoping the tide will carry it far away and dash it against distant rocks, letting her sadness be lost at sea, never to return.
I could say that she's cute, what I really mean is that cute was a concept that was spawned by pale imitations of her nature. 
That no one really understands cuteness until she comes into your life. 
By contrast, she makes kittens seem like kickable nuisances.
What I’ve been meaning to say, is that she's a rare one. 
What I’ve been trying to put into words is that there are some friends that fall into your life that you are forever grateful for. 
What I mean is, some people crowd surf, some people dance, some like to sit in balconies and watch the show from a distance. 
She is front and center, fists out and shit kicking boots. 
She is a mosh pit of a woman. 
And goddamn. 
I don’t really know who Jah is. 
I’ve heard mention of the name, some vague notions about the general idea of Jah. 
But do I have love for Jah? Now, love in what sense? There are many ways to love something or someone. 
There’s tough love, lust love, friendly love, family love, futile love, romantic love, puppy love. 
What kind of love does Jah want? Love is a dirty word. 
When asked about my love for Jah, I couldn’t answer with any sense of seriousness.
The asker of this question, and perhaps the embodiment of the answer, was a girl named Mouse. 
Her real name starts with an s, but circumstances left the rest of the letters scattered. 
She was a mouse of a girl. 
Honey brunette hair, tangled, unwashed, exploded from her scalp. 
Her hair stuck to the oversized sweater she wore. 
It fell in front of her eyes when she danced. 
She stuck out in a crowd. 
 The dive bar crowd especially. 
Anyone in pajama bottoms, any young girl in pajama bottoms and a sweater that wanders into a dive bar will turn a few heads. 
If she dances between the pool tables. 
If she waves her arms in slow motion and her body moves like a sheet hanging out to dry in the late afternoon sun. 
She’s sure to get some kind of attention.
I noticed her when she found a booth behind us. 
She was dancing from the waist up and muttering to herself. 
Being more insane then the two women next to me, I left without notice and sat with her. 
I sat fascinated. 
She was hypnotic. 
She was a crazy hippie girl that seemed lost in time and space. 
She sang along to a song that wasn’t playing on the jukebox. 
I lit a cigarette and she took it right out of my mouth and it danced around her head. 
She denied me access to my own cigarette, stealing drags when her dancing arms permitted. 
Her front teeth were bent back and under developed. 
Up close she looked sixteen. 
This was when I asked her for a name and couldn’t catch all of it. 
Then she asked me.
Do you have love for Jah?
I asked her who Jah was and why should I love him. 
Jah is everything and made everything. 
Jah is love. 
Jah made you.
My parents made me, I’m quite sure of it.
No. 
Jah made you. 
Do you have love for Jah?
How can I love something I don’t know?
If you don’t have love for Jah, then how can I have love for you?
She sat there smoking my cigarette now. 
She sat there with her eyes fixed on mine. 
She leans in close then takes my arm, jumping out of the booth. 
I’m going to teach you something about Jah. 
But first, we’re going to sit here on the sidewalk, by the house of cards and smoke another cigarette.
We’re outside the bar now, we’re half a block down the sidewalk, sitting on it, backs to the entrance of some store. 
I give her another cigarette; light her’s and then my own. 
I ask her how old she is.
Twenty four.
You don’t look twenty four.
I’m twenty four and I ran away from my husband. 
We have two children. 
But I can’t be a mother; I’m just no good for them. 
So I ran away. 
It’s for the better.
She pulls on the cigarette and huddles against me. 
Against the cold. 
There’s a man with dreadlocks. 
I’m in love with him. 
Is that so?
Yes. 
He knows so much. 
He has love for Jah.
I see. 
She huddles closer and rests her head on my knee.
I’m so drunk. 
Why am I so drunk?
Because you drank. 
That’s what happens. 
I haven’t eaten in two weeks. 
I haven’t eaten in two weeks are you going to feed me? I ate something from Jack in the Box this morning but I threw up. 
I’m so hungry.
She doesn’t say anything for a while and flicks the rest of her cigarette into the street. 
Let’s go, she says. 
I’m going to teach you something about Jah. 
That must be why I’m here.
She takes my arm and we start walking. 
She steals my hat and claims it as her own, trying to trade me for a pink knit beanie she made. 
 I keep stealing mine back. 
I tell her that her name is Mouse.
I’m much better than a mouse.
But you are a mouse.
No, I’m much better. 
I can do things a mouse can’t do.
But you have such tiny lips.
These lips. 
These lips can blow your mind. 
Right out of the water.
Really? How can they do that?
These lips can blow your mind right out of the water.
I see.
Where are we going? I’m so drunk.
I don’t know, I thought you were leading. 
We’re crossing the bridge.
We’re going to my friend’s house. 
You’re walking me home. 
But you don’t have love for Jah. 
You don’t have love for Jah and you can leave me right here mister and walk somewhere else.
She breaks free and walks ahead of me. 
I take her arm again and she says
No! You don’t have love for Jah and I can’t love you, you don’t have love for Jah.
All I can do is look at her with sadness.
I’m going to my friend’s house to smoke ganja. 
Except he puts heroin in it. 
I don’t smoke heroin but I did so now I’m addicted. 
Now I’m a junkie. 
 He’s not really my friend. 
Friend’s don’t do that. 
But I’m going over there because I’m addicted to heroin now. 
 Sometimes when I’m sleeping I can feel him in the room. 
And I turn on the light and he’s in there and his hand will be on my leg and I’ll scream and run out of the house.
I’m no stranger to sob stories. 
I’ve heard my fair share of chain yanking, leg pulling bullshit. 
I can’t believe everything she says. 
If everything she said were true then maybe I was there to rescue her. 
Maybe I could give her a shower and something to eat and some ganja without any heroin. 
Maybe that’s how she was going to help me find love for Jah. 
We’re standing out in front of a block of apartments and she has stolen my hat again.
Give me back my hat.
It’s my hat. 
Watch me rock it. 
I look good in this hat. 
It’s mine now.
No, it’s my hat. 
You have your own hat, see. 
I put the hat on her head but lose my balance. 
I’m leaning against her and she’s leaning against a van parked on the curb. 
Her hat is on her head crooked.
You pushed yourself against me!
I lost my balance, I’m sorry.
I don’t want to go in there!
So don’t. 
Stay with me for a while.
I don’t want to smoke heroin! I don’t want to be touched by that man again!
Hey, calm down, sit stay with me, smoke another cigarette.
This she does and we sit on the curb. 
Her head is in my lap again and I’m petting her hair, saying Mouse, Mouse. 
She makes the noise that a person makes when they don’t want to be crying. 
She makes noises like she’s fighting back tears. 
There’s something inside me that turns on in situations like this. 
There’s something that makes me want to fix things. 
The sound of a girl crying in your lap. 
Even if it’s a poor, ragged junkie. 
A runaway mother. 
A married girl. 
A dirty Rastafarian hippie girl with crooked front teeth and tiny lips. 
A little Mouse that danced in a dive bar. 
She sits up and leans on me. 
My arm goes around her shoulder, rubs her back sometimes. 
I try to kiss her and she turns her face, pointing at her cheek.
These lips are not for you. 
You don’t love Jah. 
She puts her hands on my face, on my cheeks and calls me her handsome artist. 
I look at her pleading, sad. 
I look at her and realize that for the last thirty minutes I’ve been completely enchanted by this girl. 
We were surrounded by realism but not between us. 
We have created a shield against the world that’s two people wide. 
Two drunks on the curb, as close as two people can be between clothing. 
She stands up and falls down straight. 
I think that means you should stay with me for a while longer.
Okay.
I go to kiss her again and she relents. 
Her tiny lips kiss mine and pull away in sudden realization. 
She gives in again and kisses me. 
We stop and look into each other’s eyes. 
Me with sadness, she with a smile and tenderness. 
Her hands touch my cheeks again and she pulls my face down. 
She pulls my face down until our foreheads touch. 
I want to take her away. 
I want to take her with me and just go. 
Anywhere and everywhere. 
I know I’m staying. 
I know it’s not time to migrate. 
So I look at her with sadness. 
I should go.
I don’t say anything; all I can do is look at her. 
She holds me close and I kiss her again. 
I kiss her and hold it and we both lose balance and fall against the van again.
That was a sign, she says. 
That was a sign and I’ll find you again and you’ll look for me. 
My handsome artist. 
She walks away and our hands hold on a for another moment. 
I watch her slip through a metal gate. 
I watch her go and she never looks back.
The book thief may be a klepto. 
I was beginning to have my suspicions. 
Two books and a few hours of my life have most certainly been stolen. 
There is also the matter of my heart. 
The little beat box for my blood. 
I wasn’t sure if she had taken it. 
It was definitely missing. 
A vital organ, perhaps the most crucial of all, had disappeared. 
I noticed the damn thing was missing this morning when I stepped on a scale and found myself to be twenty or so pounds lighter then the last time. 
I decided to check all the places where I have a tendency to lose things. 
It was in my best interests to conduct a search. 
I had a few ideas.
No one at the bar had seen it, but they offered condolences and a drink to substitute my loss. 
The drink did little for little for me but was gratefully accepted and appreciated. 
The bartender asked me if I remember the last time I saw my heart. 
I told her the last clear memory occurred sometime about a year ago two stools down from where I was sitting. 
I had spilled my drink and used it to mop up the mess. 
She said a year ago is a long time to be missing something. 
Maybe it ended up in the lost and found, next to the hats and jackets of many a black out night. 
She checked and said there were a lot of sunglasses, but I was out of luck.
I checked the bookstore to see if someone found it lying around and filed my heart away with the used books. 
Perhaps somewhere between the mystery novels and the humor section with a price tag of three-fifty plus tax. 
All the dust and neglect lead me to believe I was on the right track. 
A customer service representative checked the computer for me and said they were all out right now. 
I asked around at the buying counter and they told me to check back in a few days. 
The books on the cart had nothing to offer except a collection of classic American short stories and a guide for learning Esperanto. 
I left the bookstore with paperback novel lacking a beat. 
I called around, but no one seemed to ever remember me having one in the first place. 
Someone told me to check the bar, just in case. 
I said that was the first place I looked. 
They told me I should go back to the bar and stay there until my heart showed up. 
I said that wasn’t a bad idea. 
They asked me if I would wait for them when I got there. 
I said I wasn’t sure I’d be going back until later. 
They asked me to buy them a drink and I hung up.
A thought came to me not so much like a flash, more like the dim flickering of a fluorescent bulb in a hospital waiting room. 
Maybe at the laundry mat. 
I might have left my heart there. 
Piled under all those lost socks. 
A very reasonable assumption. 
The laundry mat had little to offer except housewives in sweatpants and the smell of fabric softener. 
In the corner at a wobbly table with impossible chairs sat an improbable person. 
She was seated like a thunderstorm in late June. 
In the deserts of Australia where the days are scalding and the nights are silent blocks of dry ice, there is a type of frog called notaden bennetti, or Catholic frogs because they wear crosses on their backs. 
They bury themselves alive for months, burrowed under the sand in a kind of hibernation in expectation of a few short days of torrential downpour. 
The continued existence of their species is dependent on brief moments of moisture. 
The rain is essential for the frogs to mate. 
Without the water the toads will die dehydrated virgins. 
Her eyes are like raindrops hitting infinitely thirsty grains of sand. 
Sitting across from her is an epileptic frog, shaking in anticipation of absorbing her every word. 
The scene inspired me to drink heavily.
Losing hope for the recovery of my centerpiece and drifting rapidly away from sobriety I made my way to the river in search of solace with a pint of whiskey. 
That’s where I found the book thief. 
She was skipping stones and whistling poorly to herself. 
I found an agreeable rock to sit on and threw the empty bottle at the water. 
The sound of hollow glass making a fuss in a lazy river did little to startle her. 
She looked at me and smiled the way children do at clowns making balloon animals.
“I knew you’d show up.” She turns back to the river and throws a rock that skips five times. 
“I had a feeling when I woke up this morning. 
Maybe it came to me in a dream. 
The cat woke me up before I was ready and I guess my mind didn’t come back to consciousness for a minute, but I was pretty sure I should stop by the river. 
The cat was being a needy little bitch and refused to leave me be. 
He does this thing where he sits on my forehead in the morning. 
As if my forehead was his own personal throne. 
I got up and fed the cat and came here. 
Furry little beasty bitch cat waking me up.” She throws a larger stone in with a satisfying splash. 
She walks over to my rock in expectation of party tricks and an inflated four legged creature. 
“Aww, what’s wrong? You look like someone popped your balloon.”
“I lost my heart and can’t find it anywhere.”
“Poor baby. 
Did you look under the couch cushions? I always lose shit there. 
One time I lost my keys in the couch and couldn’t drive anywhere for a week. 
I had to take a bus to work and that took forever. 
The other passengers all smelled like stale cheese and shame. 
One time this guy puked all over himself and the back seat. 
We had to open all the windows and wait until we were off the freeway before the driver threw him off. 
I finally found my keys when I was looking for laundry quarters. 
I was so overjoyed that I stubbed my big toe on the coffee table in the excitement of being reunited with my keys. 
My toe got all blue and looked so miserable that I couldn’t stand looking at it. 
I wore one sock around the house for days until the color went away. 
Such a fucking pain in the ass.”
“Or the foot.”
“Or the foot, yeah.”
“You haven’t seen my heart have you?”
“I didn’t think you were using it, so I thought I’d borrow it. 
You really should take better care of it. 
I mean, you didn’t even notice it was gone until now. 
Honestly, it was in quite a state. 
Besides, you really should keep it on you at all times, not on a shelf next to your ambitions and pictures of your family.”
“How long have you had it?”
“A few months, maybe longer.” The book thief bites her lip and looks at the water. 
“I have an idea,” she says. 
She takes my heart out of her pocket and polishes it with her shirt sleeve. 
“Make a wish. 
And make it a good one. 
When I was a kid and Thanksgiving came around, dad would finish carving the turkey and give me the wishbone. 
But being an only child and all, I had no one to break the bone with. 
I really didn’t feel like involving my parents in the ritual, so I made a wish with each hand and broke it by myself. 
Apparently my left hand is luckier. 
You have a wish yet?”
“Yeah, I got one.”
The thief holds my heart in the palm of her hand and throws it up high over the water. 
It lands in the river with a plunk.
“What’d you wish for? Something wonderful?”
“Can’t tell you.”
“Fine, be that way. 
I never got any of my wishes. 
Except this one time on my fourteenth birthday I was blowing out the candles and I wished that Corey Thompson would go to hell. 
He was such an asshole and thought he was so cool. 
My friend Monica had a huge crush on him. 
I never understood her. 
Two weeks later he was hit by a drunk driver in a red convertible. 
Died in the hospital that night from severe impact damage. 
Broke his legs, bits of glass in his face, punctured lung. 
Practically liquefied him. 
I felt like such a bitch. 
Still didn’t go to his funeral though” She looks across the river at the opposite shore. 
“Let’s get some coffee. 
Coffee sounds just about right.”
I continue looking at the spot where my heart sank and thought about a kid kissing the windshield at sixty miles an hour. 
“Yeah, alright. 
Let’s get some coffee.”
Vacation.
She woke up and her voice was gone. 
There was a note next to her phone by the bed.
"Had to get out of town for a few days. 
Hope you understand. 
--Love, Your Voice.
She sat on the edge of her bed re-reading the note. 
Her suitcase was missing. 
Along with a few shirts and a pair of jeans. 
This had happened before. 
She crumpled the note and tried to exclaim her dismay. 
Instead of words or syllables, there was nothing. 
She opened her mouth and silence. 
Her thoughts jogged down the paths of her mind and into her lungs. 
Her thoughts started back up intending to have her throat full of the kind of vibrations that turn air into sound. 
Instead her thoughts slipped on the slickness of her tongue, tripped on the tip of her teeth and landed face first on her lips. 
Despondency brushed over her features like a stroke from the hand of a skilled calligrapher. 
She slumps back on the bed and wonders exactly how this is going to effect her day. 
What day was it? Was it the kind of day when things needed doing? How much longer could this bed last? Can we keep this up until the voice came back? According to the phone it's a Wednesday and it's three-thirty. 
Wednesday means a day of rest before the weekend begins to tighten like a spring, wound up to unleash the full horrors of the work week. 
All warmth has faded from the sheets. 
The chill of the mid-afternoon mid-Winter air clings to the skin of her legs. 
Her torso clad in a shirt and her hair stood around in a frozen charge of electricity. 
her right hand rubs her forehead, slides down to her mouth and brushes away the feeling of waking up to a voice on vacation.
Her obligations for the day cleared up. 
Her intentions not yet manifest. 
She wonders about making plans or just feeling out the day. 
About scheduling some people or keeping it open. 
She sits back up and figures that it's time to get ready. 
She adjusts to the day and cracks her joints and exhales. 
She blinks often. 
She stands and reaches her hands towards the ceiling, lifting her shirt off her ass in a way that constitutes a private show had there been an audience. 
Her ass is worth a twenty dollar admission, show time unknown, duration a mystery, next show unscheduled. 
If you have the fine and keen eyesight, you can make out the shape of her muscles, the definition of her efforts at self beauty. 
Then the eyelid of her shirt will blink closed and her arms will return to her sides.
She might as well go downtown. 
She sure of errands and the chance of meeting a few persons both memorable and unwelcome. 
People both accepting and tolerant. 
But she can brush them off or paint them on. 
They come, they go. 
Worst case scenario, minor annoyance. 
She digs through a pile of clothes on the floor and finds a pair of jeans. 
She finds a shirt. 
She digs out a sweater. 
She's not planning on meeting anyone she'd be embarrassed about being seen without makeup or any other sign of flagrant narcissism. 
Nonchalant décor for the temple of her body.
She’s moderately satisfied with the outcome in front of a full length mirror. 
She slips on a pair of shoes in absence of socks and takes one last look before taking her purse and walking out the door.
She locks up and coffee seems suddenly reasonable. 
A nice stroll down town. 
A warm cup of coffee and whatever else comes along. 
The coffee shop is one of those. 
Full of hipsters. 
In this story, we’re going to define a hipster as anyone that makes an effort to be cool. 
Whatever they may define cool as. 
The most important point is that coolness must seem inherent and unintentional. 
Like some kind of happy accident. 
The coffee isn’t bad. 
Nor is it good. 
It is coffee. 
And it does what coffee is meant to do. 
The coffee is a conduit for warmth and stimulation.
She stands at the counter and tries to order. 
She looks at the menu and opens her mouth. 
There are no words escaping. 
Something like a croak or a squeak. 
She finds a napkin and scrawls down “one cup of house coffee to go” and pushes the napkin towards the beverage attendant. 
He takes the paper and somewhere between amusement and vexation returns with a steaming paper cup.
She hands him two dollars and she takes her coffee off to the right where they keep the cream and sugar. 
Lots of both to make everything drinkable. 
She seals it with a lid and makes her way to the door.
In her way is a boy with no plans or direction. 
Right in front of her is a boy familiar and foreign. 
Absentee and native. 
Long time gone and happy to see her. 
They stand in front of each other for a minute like, oh hello, what are you doing here? So nice to see you and now what?
He abandons his plans to get himself a cup. 
To recharge his phone and write something down. 
This is why plans are unnecessary and always get changed. 
This is why running into people seems to be a much more organic way to deal with a day off. 
You never really know. 
But you can hope.
They walk down the steps together and he asks her questions and she tries to talk only managing faint whispers. 
He finds himself in a position where he’s expected to fill silence. 
An altogether unfamiliar situation. 
He tries to talk but everything comes out wrong without accompaniment. 
Without a response to the call. 
Everything just sounds like an unstructured list. 
A rattling off of things that have happened recently. 
He would have loved to hear everything she has to say. 
He’s sure she could talk for a while and he’d be more than happy to listen. 
She tries to use words and all she can manage are frustrating attempts at vocalization.
She has decided that she needs a new pair of gloves and possibly a new sweater. 
The reality of winter has dawned on her and the need for new warmth is readily apparent. 
The go into a used clothing store. 
She seems to know her way around, bobbing and weaving through the aisle of dusty jackets and long sleeve shirts whose only purpose now is to catch eyes at tongue in cheek parties and events meant to make the attendees think of the Seventies. 
It would be nostalgia if anyone was even born yet. 
Instead we call it retro. 
A shout out to an era past that had definable characteristics. 
Before originality died and left us with nothing except the remix and the mash up. 
A razor blade and tape or a blender. 
It was a Wednesday and there were other people in the store. 
No one is in a hurry. 
No one is rushing around. 
No matter. 
No bother. 
The boy at her side tries his best to ramble charmingly. 
He pauses frequently, hoping she’ll start talking. 
He is urged to continue on. 
He starts using his surroundings for inspiration. 
Handing her things or holding others up for approval or rejection. 
Looking for humor in between mauve sweaters and cardigans designed for Christmas parties at the regional center for the blind.
They find commonality by way of mockery. 
Shared interest in making fun of some else’s serious effort. 
Be it a song on the radio or a jacket with altogether too many feathers and frills. 
She decides they are done here.
They walk a block down and turn into another store, much like the first but more modern in taste. 
Second hand hip college age clothing for thrifty twenty-somethings. 
The routine continues; where she shops and the boy looks around for amusement and distraction. 
He’s just tagging along. 
No mind. 
No matter. 
A pleasant side track with a friend he hasn’t seen in so long. 
She smiles often and makes out something like a laugh on occasion. 
All that really matters is time together well spent. 
She finds a white sweater. 
Something cute and easy to throw on. 
She makes her purchase and they leave together. 
They walk along until the time comes to part ways. 
She to her home and he back to the coffee shop. 
They say goodbye and make motions to keep in touch. 
She walks alone across a parking lot, up a hill and disappears from view. 
The boy watches her go. 
He wonders if should have let her get away so easily. 
I turn the hot water facet on full, letting my hand judge temperature before adjusting with the cold. 
I find balance and pull the lever to divert the flow to the shower head. 
Inside steam fills the spaces between seemingly solid objects. 
In between the soap and shampoo bottle, the loofa and razor blade. 
I breathe the vapor in, drinking air and water, un-parching my throat. 
I cough several times, feeling it burn in the back of my mouth. 
I cough up a jade and chestnut colored wad of whatever that is taking up residence in the early morning aisle of my air way. 
It's not over yet. 
One finger presses closed each nostril in succession, I blow hard adjusting the pressure until it feels clear up there. 
The bottom of the shower is specked with blood, mucus, snot and saliva. 
I step to the right of the shower and let it wash down the drain, being careful to keep my feet clear. 
I scratch at the brown bird's nest and wince; it's still sore, that sonnavabitch. 
I can feel the puffiness of my eyes, and the sour pit in my stomach. 
I cough again like an asthmatic cat. 
Funny how you shake the same when you're cold. 
You shake like everything's vibrating; a silly observation, of course. 
Everything is vibrating. 
You're so silly sometimes, you're so fucking silly you make me sick. 
If only you could see yourself right now, you haggard wet rodent. 
With your little mouse face. 
Your little mouse face with it's big stupid eyes. 
God I hate my eyes. 
Why couldn't I have Grace Kelly eyes? Would that have been too much? Is that too much to fucking ask? I cough up more mucus and look at my unsteady hand. 
I hold the soap and loofa together with opposite hands, trying to make some sense and suds out of their pairing. 
I wash my face, my shoulders, my left arm then my right, working from the top down. 
Working under and over the left breast, which is slighter larger than the right. 
Maybe it has something to do with dominate hands? Maybe if I were ambidextrous I'd have perfect, symmetrical tits. 
Symmetrical would make more sense as a word if it were a palindrome. 
That's absurd. 
Words are absurd. 
I wish I didn't need words anymore. 
They just made simple things complicated. 
I suppose they made some complicated things simple too. 
The water rinses me off and I just stand there, letting the water do what it needs to. 
I sit in the stream, hugging my knees. 
I rest my head on my knees, resting my big stupid eyes on my knee caps. 
I'm still shaking. 
I'm biting my lower lip and I can feel it shaking. 
I can feel my teeth bouncing up and down on my lower lip. 
They bounce unexpectedly hard during a violent shake and bite down. 
I swear and close my eyes. 
I keep swearing in a low voice. 
I'm running down the list of four letter words, repeating my favorites and combining the others. 
I'm mixing and matching obscenities. 
I'm going to keep doing this until I feel better. 
I'm going to keeping fucking swearing until I feel better or at least numb or something else that's not this. 
When the swearing doesn't seem to help much, I start throwing in blasphemy. 
I can swear at God. 
I can give God a verbal beating and berating. 
I'll rip that shit-eating, puss-fucking, bastard-ass-dick-fuck-rat-fucking-bitch-cunt God a new cosmic asshole. 
I can do the same for Jesus and the saints and that whore Mary and Buddha and Shiva and Mohammad and Hare-fucking-Krishna. 
I don't know who's left any more. 
I don't know and I don't care and I don't know when I started choking on the words and coughing. 
I don't know when the water from the shower and my eyes starting running together. 
I don't know when the profanity and the blasphemy and the vulgarity started coming right back at me. 
You stupid bitch, you stupid fucking bitch. 
I reach out and turn the facets off; push in the lever for the shower. 
I sit a while longer, still hugging my knees and shaking. 
I wish I could have just found comfort in a bowl of chocolate pudding and a diet coke.
There she is. 
Behind the bar where she belongs. 
In leopard print skin tight breast enhancing attire. 
Tight black pants to match. 
Heavy handed whiskey angel herself. 
The setting changed since the last time. 
From swank red plush to surfer central tiki torch cocktail party to rough and tumble biker bar. 
It suits her somehow. 
She is more of a twelve pack girl. 
A Night Train on ice lady. 
She pours bourbon and bitters into just the right size glass. 
She prepares me, fixes me up, sets me right. 
There was a guy in here a few nights back. 
Frying balls on a fungus trip. 
Thought she was divine. 
Like an actual angel from heaven. 
Just kept staring at her in some vain hope of salvation or redemption or something else entirely. 
Understandable. 
Even sober I’ve made that mistake. 
She’s angelic enough. 
She could be a devil in disguise. 
Nobody’s a hundred percent on this.
If you were on a fist full of mushrooms, this is not the bar you’d want to be in. 
Heavy rumble rock and roll, bright beer lights, blaring nonsense televisions. 
If you were tripping at light speed the pretty girl behind the bar would be the only pleasant focal point for miles. 
Not a lot of angels wear leopard print. 
Or sport the short black bob rockabilly girl look. 
But she pulls it off like she’s been doing it for years. 
She probably has been. 
She’ll probably keep doing it for years to come.
I’m double fisting a pint of water and a perfect Manhattan. 
Guy down the bar asks for her hand in marriage. 
He does this every night. 
She says, “I’d love to, but my minister is out of town.” She smiles all coy like and turns with a dancer’s grace to the other end of the bar, my end of the bar. 
She throws a wink in my direction. 
She walks over. 
She says, “Another?” to some guy with a bent body and a crooked back and a forehead facing the bar top. 
The guy looks her up and down twice, says, “Sure.” She twists again with fluid motion, pours ice, gin and tonic into a glass. 
Wedges a lime on the rim and stabs a straw in between the cubes. 
Takes two napkins and puts the whole thing down on the bar at once. 
She says, “five fifty.” He reaches for his wallet and she looks over at my glasses. 
One half empty, one half full. 
She makes eye contact with me, then the glasses. 
This is her way of asking me if I need another drink. 
I wait until she can have my full attention and I can have hers. 
I shake my head. 
No, not right now.
I watch her make change. 
I watch her laugh politely at the small talk, and charming one-liners of the other patrons. 
And I wait. 
I watch and sip and wait. 
I take it down to the ice and shake it like a melancholy maraca. 
On cue, she salsas over. 
She leans on the ice machine and tells me how silly the people on the other end of the bar are.
One of the guys comes over. 
Some roughneck. 
This is a roughneck bar, after all. 
He says, “This your boyfriend?” He motions at me.
“I’m not that lucky.” I say. 
She laughs and glows and pours me another drink. 
The roughneck looks at us again and says, “There’s something between you two. 
You can’t be married. 
That ain’t how married people look at each other.”
“Can’t get married,” I say, “that’d ruin everything.”
“Don’t get married,” he says, “only turn a good thing bad.”
We drink in silence, watching the whiskey angel mix, pour, make change, set the taps. 
He gives me a look, up and down. 
Shakes his head, puts his empty bottle on the bar and leaves. 
I light a cigarette and watch him leave. 
Watch the girl behind the bar. 
Watch my glass get lighter. 
Later on I’m going to say good night. 
I’m going to pay a tab neither of us has been keeping track of. 
 She’s going to say good night. 
And then I’m going to go home. 
But not after a Long Kiss Goodnight.
Long Kiss Goodnight.

Twist of lemon

Whoah is a new face. 
Sound resounding in echo shots across the canyons of mind space. 
My flaxen haired princess, dancing with seven veils off in silhouettes on the cave wall. 
Finding only puppets and pretenders, we soldier on. 
Searching and lurching, motion sick on an oil slick of loose change. 
Each page a veritable lexicon in process, and a sign on the door reads "Out to Lunch." 
Bare walls display naught, a cleavage shot speckled with freckles and an ill timed glare. 
I long to be type writer bound, a slave to letters and phrases.
Drift drift, drifting swift dynamis, a shift winded long. 
I'll decide. 
Keep going, get the crap out. 
Characters unformed, deconstructed and laid bare. 
Who admits to passion? Cheap lays and one night stands give me no interest. 
A love affair with a fair haired harlot, scarlet lady with seductress eyes smiles. 
I'm skipping beats at one thirty three in the passenger side of a carpool lane. 
My driver reeks of whiskey and Camel Lights. 
He's yelling over the stereo, a siren's song in futility.
We Flip through a photobook of false hopes, prophets of Baphomet acting out of spite. 
Scripts written cryptically, I make no promises of sense making in these brief moments of sobriety.
"Alight, get out and push"
A stubborn, black ford escort rests in fained mortum astride a side walk near midnight.
"Son of a bitch!"
The engine is gurgle-burbling to life. 
The things we do for tequila tuesday. 
The bald one is a tit addict on testosterone overload. 
He shouldn't be driving and I shouldn't be here. 
Always along for the ride, we take back streets. 
Another DUI would land him a stint. 
The escort has a lived in feel. 
Fast food wrappers and cigarette remains litter what once was a floor. 
The back seat passenger is an assortment of randomly laundered wardrobery.
We speed down, whipping around corners in search of coroners and RIP. 
I'm stuck in number nine. 
Transitions don't come easy. 
I'm the beat down of a morning erection. 
Red hair green eyed Bride of Satan sings old songs and burned out punks outside coffee houses. 
Couples in sync step stride hand in hand along side third wheel friendships. 
Snide jokes written margin side to amuse the perceptive. 
Back crack snaps focus to fleeting minds. 
Hand written sloppy love letters to the damned.
"Some one's going to have hell to pay."
"Jesus."
Blasphemers in debtors prison; this purgatory of princes.

The fat kid craze, fast food junkies on a binge of oil soaked french fries. 
Marching to arches, Mecca bound Pilgrims out for a fix. 
Cease and desist orders from the top down. 
Top heavy gestapo imprison the minds of men with tits and booze.
The Great American Novel will be written out of spite and disgust.
Ass distraction. 
I could write about pretty girls forever. 
I find my delights in eyes and smiles, sultry stares and blushing. 
Stammered words and whispered greetings make difficult the task at hand. 
I'm shit when it comes to women. 
Quantity and quality at odds. 
A bevy of bitches and butchered Beatles tunes fill previously empty spaces. 
Black ink Rorschach blurbs replace recognizable words on paper. 
Awaiting typed refinement. 
Heart break and failure refill fears that I want to forget. 
Black brew, a poisoned well of refreshment. 
Roasted beans and buzz words, conversations play out over loud speakers on sets designed by opium addicts. 
Hash fiends on the rebound cast from the aether by avenging angels.

Familiar faces flood each entrance. 
White dust nose wipes, precious powder peddlers turn profits out of paupers.

Hydration yields new life. 
Sacred waters run red with the blood of saints. 
Pub crawling patriots conspire in ill-lit corners. 
Rolling their R's and spitting in buckets the stench of dip and saliva. 
Stale smoke hangs acrid amongst superficial hair pieces and subtle vibrations on eastern strings. 
Sultans sit pillow straddle, a celebration of brazen proportions. 
Sentence to sentence incoherent ramblings littered with moments of consistency. 
I'll decide. 
Everyone silently screaming "Look at me!" Self absorbed attention whores drunk off years of neglect.
Watermelon watermelon rutabaga rutabaga.
A lull, droll smile. 
Nod and forgotten. 
Soldier on little lover. 
Someday your heart will race, a tour d'force, cyclically. 
Could we avoid puns for just a line? Third minds drift by the waysides. 
Seeds sown sans care by dirt merchants and mediocre scam artists. 
First one's always free. 
If only my mouth could move like my pen. 
You're adorable in your own way, faint smiles quiet words whispered in tandem. 
Persons and people watchers, content to observe, never missing moments. 
We stand adrift in the shallows, afraid of depth and the dangers lurking therein. 
Neon signs bark in color code at strangers and street preachers. 
Sipping away at pink slips, cloudy headed muses shout from roof tops via the mouths of suicide youths. 
Self destructive simpletons drinking themselves to glorious oblivion.
Snoring on sidewalks, an androgynous bi-polarity spins in a yin-yang. 
Constants flux, a redux of yesterday in detail. 
Red dressed vixens beat in time with a funeral brigade. 
A parade of peacocks in full bloom spread plumage like tarot cards.

Well rounded table nights and five card studs make bets against the odds. 
Crack a bottle with a Bic. 
Suds explosion followed by table mopping behind fluorescent beer signs, previously hung where steins were lifted. 
Waiting, waiting. 
Always waiting. 
When I look down it becomes a blur of squares. 
Pawns make first moves, canon fodder fiddlers sing ballads behind empty hats. 
Parole officer shake downs spread fear along paranoid paths, catching in well made traps the down trodden. 
Nobody wins the spite game. 
Back and forth motivated men make mockery of all things sacred. 
Seductress in a red dress stands under a street light, a solitary soldier of vice, the spice of life.

Drip it goes, in one way out the other. 
To each his own, down to the bones, shake rattling tombs. 
A prophet in his own land counting grains of sand on a deserted beach. 
I see bicycles like the two of pents. 
Pent up skinny rage unleashed and declawed. 
Write five pages to right five wrongs, sing songs while you sleep sweet incubus. 
Tales told ad nauseum, this mausoleum of scripts carried in carpet bags to the steps of the doors of perception, steeped in funnel cake memories. 
She's my little dervish, spinning on a rinse cycle through looped synapses. 
Always bark up the wrong tree house, describe what you see from ten feet tall. 
On a river running through it, and so it ends with my nights planned by others. 
In the face of absolute terror, Pan pipes smoke via ventilation shafts. 
Billowing on pillows, we sit, my friends and I, drunkenly inhaled. 
Sweating and restlessness sets in. 
You see, the reason we arn't so close is that I simply can't risk falling in love with you. 
I can only really get to know a woman that I'm romantically interested in. 
But enough about me.
Saunter and sway, head held by hands not his, rousing eye slit cracks to light blinding flashes. 
Reflexive defensive mechanisms subconsciously shut it out again. 
Fever, fever, inferno on a four head. 
One extra to keep an eye on Heaven. 
As a dove, so be low. 
Fish out of water, fish out of water!

A morose reminder tacked in sticky notes. 
Quiver erroneously, shivers in this chill factor sends brakes to snake charmers. 
Focus focus on these, this ink stained hocus pocus. 
write write write out of love out of spite, spit fire breath venom vehenmonously. 
Cowardly staring in conflict we sign to opting out entirely, there they are, the kids from the dance; strip mall dopplegangers make flanger sounds in suburban settings. 
Much like simpletons, really.
The house itself, sits on a hillside, waist deep in sand and oak leaves. 
A stone Madonna overlooking the garden. 
Hodge podged together, a wet mess of foliage, both weeds and bulbs, encircle the great oak. 
It's one of about five on the property. 
One on the other side of the house, about three in the back. 
The neighbors have several. 
Before the Hoagies moved in and cleared most of the forest, it was my playground. 
I'd wander by the bee hive, in residence at the old wooden shed. 
We had raided the hive for honey comb, Noah, Ian and I. 
I remember the heavy wax comb. 
The smell of fresh honey accompained by buzzing rage. 
We'd catch scorpians in these woods and watch them slaughter pill bugs and earwigs in a wash basin arena we'd found deep in the woods the previous summer.
Hamilton, Hilton resorting to measures of feighned desperation on a national level, headed straight to oblivion. 
A merchants death was his last wish, a dish at last comes to us from a neighbor we never knew. 
It smells like smoked fish and liver. 
We wash this down on a lazy sunday by the river, driftwood seated, serenaded by rapids and water fowl. 
Fouls and intimate plans, best laid to rest at summer's end. 
These times that try and test the unbroken men in droves, they wait in line for words to say. 
Tongue tied orators tease in paragraphs using bullshit prose like matadors in heat. 
Crumbly bums make their way to greyhound launchpads, life coaches sans a fairy godmother. 
At steak is a nice way to say Weldon. 
Waldon and nature boy escape in fleeting moments. 
More desperation. 
I miss my good pen. 
This is some weak chai. 
Wish i still lived near the M. 
The M with it's coffee shop people. 
The burnouts and fags. 
Queerest place in town draws out the best in people. 
The more interesting, the weirdos and dregs. 
Dirty Miss Behaviours, flirty with danger. 
She said she thinks i'm cool. 
Twice. 
It was the way she said it. 
And my terrible knack for reading too far into things. 
But it just can't mean nothing.
Banana. 
Quack. 
Jack's hopping up and down like donald duck. 
They tagged the trailer behind work with the quack attack. 
They sell the times here. 
For some reason my respect just went up, and I hate myself for it. 
Black coffee now. 
Finish page, have smoke, write the goodbye scene. 
Promise me. 
Just promise me one thing. 
Please. 
Mia petit Bella.

Wake and bakers, the makers of morsels succulent and seductive, reduction of chocolate sugar and cream. 
We step like butterflies caught in filing cabinets, reluctent tenets in a beurocratic nightmare. 
I could see him look both ways, back in '68. 
He wasa devil's son, but widow nurtured. 
His aunt always wore that almond colored apron, and smelled like vanilla extract. 
Her flour stained sausage fingers gently coaxing shape and structure to the mound of dough on the table before her. 
She forms small cakes with care, gives each one a kiss of crushed pecans and powdered sugar. 
Into the oven for a while. 
Won't be long now. 
She reaches up to the cupboard and extracts a musty, dust layered bottle, laundenum.
Now recliner bound as the children sleep. 
Sun dripping in through half drawn blinds, she sips, opiating, letting the stone settle. 
A pack of Lucky Strikes rests on the side table. 
Still cellophane enclosed, but open at the end. 
A long white stick dangles from her age and worry wrinkled lips. 
Inhale, exhale. 
And her whole body sighs.

It's kinda contradictory, to say the least. 
This chill breeze, sending shiver reactions, dividing factions of nursing school rejects. 
Fly on a dime and stop on it, drop off some books to satisfy his hunger.
There are not enough fucks to say. 
Seriously, delirious misconceptions, breeding competition. 
Reenacting presuppositions My life in transitions. 
And lonliness sets in, futility. 
Love with a capitol L. 
We sway on swing sets, spitting into the wind. 
A discourse in body fluids, falling water and mucas makes poor nutrition for flowers and weeds. 
I can't get her out of my head for a minute, and god, i want to fuck him up. 
Punchin his teeth and watch him be raped by a pit bull. 
Fucking fuck douchebag cocksucking freeloader motherfucker. 
god, i hate him. 
I wish death and shit on his miserable shitfucking being.
Now that that's out. 
efforts redoubled.
Bubble bubble, toil trouble all for naught. 
tales told by idiots, full of resounding nonchalance. 
We dance at two steps, up flights of stairs amidst stares and glaring streetlight serenades, Baby lobbing grenades in a lobby by the side street motel. 
Vacant stares, previously vacant stairs, now occupied by chain smoking adolsents. 
Street life. 
And I'm married to it.
Seriously, what the fucking fuck. 
Can't we just be alone, like we used to? You and me, baby, until the sun burns out. 
Back to basics. 
And I don't want to go home. 
just sit here, letter bound, chained to my opus, these notebooks where in. 
Within stems, nice stems. 
It's so fucking obvious i'm such a fucking third wheel. 
i don't want this. 
I don't like this. 
masochism everywhere. 
And she's back. 
So prominent, like a dusty light fixture in an antique shop, surrounded by memories and neglected things. 
And I do love neglected things. 
Escape now.
West cliff
There’s a lighthouse on the point.
The beacon years out of use
It stands majestically neglected
Lacking in ships to guide in
Replaced now by years decades of navigational technology.
It’s true what they say
How you only see couples when you’re single
Their happiness in direct proportion to how lonely
You are when they pass by, arm in arm
Hand in Hand
Lips to Lips.
Out of eye corners I keep catching glimpses
Of golden curled short strawberry blondes.
The face is never right
Or the figure.
But I still double take
Look again just to check
Knowing full well the impossible implications
There’s this lighthouse on the point.
The city turned it into a surf museum.
Someday I’d like to take you there
And hold, embrace kiss you deep
While a swell curls, breaks and crashes
On the rocks below,
Sending snowy foam wave debris scattered
Upwards and out.
Grasping in vain at the seagulls
That refuse to do anything but shit everywhere
And Soar away.
(untitled)
You can try to hold it waiting for a moment
A space a place in time
A spot so quiet that you dare to scream
No one calls the cops out of fear
For the one guy doing what’s on everyone’s mind.
Engage this sense desensitized
And realize for the first and last time
That these dreams so fading with waking
And split second stops
For Ben Raymond
History Repeating
A ballad sent forth from the lips
The thrusting hips of water closet hookups
Of drunken game spit
Of empty bottle balancing acts
Of Cigarette butt happy endings
All the while in tie and funeral shirt
The great observer taking notes
On eavesdropped conversation snippets.
The modern writer, on track minding a storehouse of memories
That orbit around the previous center of the universe
The sun around the earth despite science
In spite of logic and lunacy
Always in transition to hangover
Tickling a notebook to coax out clichés
Reworded to subtle brilliance.
For Moe Moe
She walks like a jukebox
Whistle then hums then singing out loud
The top forty hits echoing off housing structures
All alone taking courage by breaking the dead of night silence
Of Foreigner decent, shedding the remnants of common decency
And the strangers looking on at her vocal straining lunacy.
Nose in a book always
Eyes tracing retracing the same paragraph
She bums out filters by request
Lamenting the new voids in a quickly draining half pack.
And sustenance dictates departure
While shame faced dumb dogs nap in the back of station wagons
We drain a twelve pack in her parking lot
And ill lit games of hacky sack refuse to end
Swill with us this two buck chuck
And Duck swaps jokes between swigs of beer
With a tossed brunette boy, restless and awaiting
Road trips.
For Bitchnuts.
The patron saint of strip clubs
Beer guzzling bald headed
Receding hairline harbinger.
I held you up post bull riding
As you staggered force footed up the stairs
Into the caring arms of cousins who love you.
Bury your face in the massive flesh pillows
After awkward shower sex scenes.
My windbreaker is somewhere on your floor
Somewhere between the Maxims and Bud Light bottles
Burnt out butts on your balcony.
My would be brother in law
Empty rum bottle battles
On clock intoxicated escapades
And dangerous flirtations with no longer underage waitresses.
I could palm her whole ass one handed.
Half Asian half sisters and you on the floor
With the man stealing ho bag.
And the bitchy roommate that called me creepy
When really she’s just a shitty hostess
And a filthy little mudshark
Downloading Counting Crows songs on the couch.
Pervasive pole dancer leaves jaws dropped
Girls with envy.
The culmination of years of study
And rows of dollar bill pyramids.
Movie quoting manwhore.
Bitch nuts forever and I hope you never grow up.
Pac Ave.
Pacific Avenue is my real home.
Where I go no matter how I feel
To be distracted in your bookshops
To waste countless hours between a half dozen cafes.
To devour all those slices from Rockers, Pizza and Grille, Pizza My Heart.
I love you and your kelp’d beaches
Your bumming Boardwalk, filthy sidewalk littered with tourists.
Your bums harass me constantly
The street urchins refuse to let me be
For cigarettes, spare change, petition signatures
Bus fare and booze money.
You panhandling persistent poor
I wish you’d just get a fucking job
And Leave me alone.
Santa Cruz, you are a paradox unto yourself
An enigma never at peace
I don’t like it when you tone it down
I like you wild and weird,
Your grown up hippies and all too quickly matured street kids
I miss you when I leave
I’d kiss you goodbye but I’m not so fond of disease
I’ll blow it your way flying down 17
Watch you catch it between what remains of your meth stained teeth.
Heartbreaker
What she lacks in chest
She makes up for in legs and ass.
Change color hair, straight and elegant
With deep brown doe eyes that hypnotize and tease
She’s a hell of a saleswoman
And a gold digging bitch.
She’ll show up on your doorstep at three in the morning
Looking scared and helpless.
Barfly and hellion, hell raiser and Helen of Troy
We gave you a nine point two and clapped when you walked in the room
Oblivious heartbreaker
And I timed my smoke breaks around you;
Always a perfect gentleman.
For Mikey
Gazing towards heaven,
But it’s only space.
Empty infinite boarding school for Stars.
And I linger on
Lying on the floors of saints
Wallowing in their unclean carpets
Wishing on a painted moon
I wake only to find
The fading memory of a dream
That left me blue balled.
The Scientific Method.
It’s thirty-six inches from me to you.
Measuring tape seldom lies. 
Retracts with a snap
Recoils and whirs.
Extending again to find the extent
And no, not the former habitat of past camping trips.
Stretch up and out to cards long ago shuffled
And it’s sixty-three inches from you to aces.
Misplaced poker hands stuck with invisible adhesives
Making a map of potential pot winners
Granting solace to chip holders.
We measure again a means to an end
It’s fifty-four inches before you go.
The distance to broken doorways with still working locks
Soon passing through your feet clad in shoes
Or your sole bared in flip-flops.
On Sexual Frustration.
Big fan of summertime
Summertime with short skirts
And low riding hip huggers
Halter top heroin
Just let me inject interjections
And rejection junkies on a sidewalk fix.
Cleavage peeks from the bosoms and blossoms
Tank top titters and sniggering giggles
Give rise, give rise
And Christ alive a little release.
Meticulously catalog the hunched over
Un-pantied ass cracks,
Pleasant distractions compliments of Levi Strauss.
I can’t protest the way women dress
In this season of heat.
You can only admire, be pleased by the tease;
Sultry skin scenes played out between shoulder blades.
Leggy lovers spreading rumors amongst other things.
Only imagine the treasures hidden under very impractical shorts.
Eye catching ankle tattoos give me kicks
And people watching is always cheaper than strip clubs.
Until you get home, dead bolted door behind you
And engage in purely utilitarian masturbation rituals
Sowing your seeds in crumpled tissues
Just to empty out excess body fluids.
The Misfits.
We exist by division,
Conflicting definitions,
Spracked out day dream hangover victims.
On restroom walls
Manifestos pass for graffiti;
These chicken scratch chronicles
Sold from the trunk of a stolen Mercedes.
Wild on whiskey we howl at a full moon
And laugh like shattering glass.
The sounds of defiance waft heavenward
Like so many billowy clouds
Of Cigarette smoke.
With hash crazy red-eyes
We peer into crystal strip malls
Pray to nothing in particular
And laughing, always laughing.
Just another saliva soaked finger
Singing on the rim of a wine glass.
I hear voices around every corner
That sound like stale beer,
Nestled in aluminum prisons
Half consumed under the unholy
Lidless, listless gaze
Of everything we hold
Dear.
She cuts her lip on a Zig-Zag
And slices her tongue amidst
The screams of so much
White noise.
She stands on a balcony
Bathed in the blood
Of her ever open mouth.
We watch her dive like a china doll
With less than horror
In her eyes;
We sigh with envy
At her calm complacency
And her dream
Of a beautiful
Suicide.
II
We gather again at the end of our wits;
Make plans for a wake.
I polish my minister�s badge
And write for her, a eulogy.
She rests now; coffin bound in robes so silky sheen.
Obscene scenesters hang their heads
Half in sorrow, half from the weight
Awaiting words regurgitated
Little chicks unable to chew, they sit on pews
Sending text messages.
Throat cleared now and hrumph hum hum.
You are not my dearly beloved,
My brothers and sisters and not family by any means.
End now this silly charade and claim again
Your birthright;
Which is just to live as you see fit.
Fuck you and your attention span.
Fuck you in your head, not listening.
Fuck you and your precious festering wounds.
Your puckered lips are a cat�s asshole.
Your words fall short like little shits
Sticking to the fur.
I watch you when you fuck or copulate.
Bang, buck, punk, pork, poke, prod your prick
Into musk scented love sockets.
You are my pornography,
Lying in a casket.
III
Days and weeks pass and skid
Grind by, halting here and there.
Rap at a window late night
Let�s me know the time is right.
A brick as thick as it gets smashes the silence
Red smatter shattering pane
She reaches in and grabs me by the neck
Drags me under a shot out street lamp.
We camp a minute, flicking bics.
And inhale deep down,
Returning wide eyed and ready.
Grasping hands we run off into pitch black
Promises of promiscuous perversions.
She hangs a leg out of the window of a car
Letting wind whip her three days unshaven legs.
Her face facing starry ceiling
Sings a battle cry at hitch hikers;
A thumbs up serenade
To the tune of Isn�t it Romantic
We drive a hot hatchback into the waves
And cheer at mermaids.
Bastet sits on the shore
Basking in the glow
Of our collective cheerful absurdity.
She runs thin nicotine stained fingers
Through hat perfect hair,
Kisses her finger tips
And muahs at nothing at all.
Give �em hell, give �em hell
And break the spell of boredom.
Badass china doll face breaks no fasts
In the lanes of the happy highways
Pulling blind corners, pausing
Only to lurch four letter words off the tongue of a mute.
We shoot shit like it means something.
These small talk soliloquies have only the dim reflection
Of it�s so nice to see you again.
Now motionless lips and wandering eyes,
Indulging in the semi-awkward silence.
I was going to write a poem about loneliness and sobriety.
I was starring at the wall and couldn’t sleep
Again.
When I turned out the light and went to bed
In place of you I read a story
About an emaciated daredevil.
He died trying to become famous.
He pulled three and a half stunts
And then he died.
In my bed I’m on a motorcycle
Flying over a line of semi-trucks
Your name is Peterbuilt
And you’re the last truck in the line.
Why yes, I have tried flossing.
At five thirty in the morning
The only sound is wheezy breathing coming through the wall
One of the teeth on my right side feels funny
But it’s not hilarious.
My tooth is terrible at standup comedy
All his jokes are racist and vaudevillian
After the show he goes to his dressing room
Lights a cheap cigar, drinks bad brandy
And misses his uncle
The one that taught him how to laugh.
With a pretty bow on top.
I’ve been trying quite hard not to write about you.
Like when you were a child and you had a gift that was
So special
That secretly you hid the treasure
Only bringing to light when alone for fear that someone would
Steal, mock, judge, destroy, crush
And the gift would disappear
If you told even god in your prayers
But secret gifts have a tendency to wander off
And right now
I am all the wrapping paper in the world
On the day after Christmas
The time is six in the morning
I am sober, therefore I wake
And write shitty poems
That are not about you
Or the lack thereof.
I see your face when I close my eyes
So I turn over
To cook under your gaze
Equally on all sides
And wish for the thousandth time
That I bought some whiskey
So that when I close my eyes
I see nothing
And I don’t have to
Write shitty poems
That are not about you
At six in the morning.
Pokerface.
I read a story once
Maybe in the paper
About a man that was stranded in the dessert
He had a small flask of water which he sipped sparingly
He wandered in as straight of a line as he could
Sipping only when necessary.
He found old water bottles, dry and plastic
Empty and drained.
He walked into a fence eventually
That contained a yard for someone’s house
The fence surrounded a swimming pool
He was found floating face down
And grinning in a way
Completely unsuitable for playing poker.
Advertisements cease making sense. 
No all, but some. 
Sombunal. 
Some people read on the train.
But not all.
Some read books with fine titles and flashy tits.
Her face wasn’t so bad really.
She made up for it by allowing her breasts to buoy out of her blouse.
Calling lost sailors to shore,
Distracting them from the cliffs of her face.
Unrequited love
Is going to be the death of me
If the cancer doesn’t catch up.
Oakland passes underneath me
Like sweeping the kitchen floor
And watching the crumbs seek refuge
Under the oven.
The coliseum stands like a concrete bunker
Awaiting war time
When grown men fight over an inflated ball.
You know how I know we’re perfect apart?
Because when I went home with you
There was an inch of bourbon
In the bottle by your bed.
And when I got home
There was an inch of bourbon
In the bottle next to mine.
Hello Nine A.M.
Anything new?
Nothing really, huh.
Just more of the same
You’d think another day would
Bring changes
But fuck that
Everything is just fine
Just like always
Hello Nine A.M.
I’m going back to bed.
Notice I didn’t say sleep
I don’t know where that is
Good night, Nine A.M.
See you tomorrow.
If you’re lucky.
In January the sun is out early
The heat is like spring
But it’s January.
My throat is protesting.
My throat is a raw hamburger football
Kicking around in a parking lot full of metal heads.
They pass a black leather studded bottle around
And take turns
Throwing my throat at each other.
In January, the sickness found me
Happy Birthday, self.
I hope you’re happy.
I hear children and vacuums
Through the walls of the next apartment
How I long for them
To become one.
Burn, burn on down.
Bourbon down.
One to go.
On down.
One more.
That’s all.
Just one more.
For the road.
Radio Silence
In times of crisis
Like waiting for a call
Cutting through the static.
Fuck.
Fuck radio silence.
Restful eyes and I, not so much
A hiccup nap in sleep’s great coughing fit
For a king would simply order it so
But just as well, I’ve run dry
A pill, a pillow, a puddle between
My legs and all I have left is
Meh.
Whatever man.
See you tomorrow.
Flushed face, lever down leave it to Beaver
Fine dining marathon betwixt your thighs
And eyes again, closed and open mouth
For heavy breath and heaving breast when
Twin hills point accusingly at the
Ceiling.
Now that’s what I call breakfast.
Gee Wally.
And his waffles were slathered with syrup.
One can down and some time ago
I can’t remember when.
Clutter can of memory loss
And five cents of redemption
From the land of Blue Waters.
One cigarette left
One thirty in the morning
One pack for three days
I must be getting old.
Or I would have smoked it already.
Every time the phone makes a sound
I think, maybe it’s one of my women.
But it’s only B-Ray. 
And he wants to know about a printer.
I don’t have a goddamn printer.
I don’t have anything worth printing.
Especially not all those letters to women.
The ones that never garnered a response.
Or all the stories.
The ones that have been rejected by magazines.
Judged unfit for print.
I don’t have a goddamn printer.
Blood finger is a sign of carelessness.
But oh well, I was in a hurry.
I can shit tomorrow.
The house smells great
Like chicken soup
Which is tomorrow
No work and all the time in the world
Hurray for days off.
Hurray for shit and chicken soup.
This is the tenth cigarette I’ve smoked in bed
Since the last time I emptied the ash tray.
There are no bottles or cans next to my bed.
A sad sign that this is the morning of pay day.
When I can’t afford to be drunk at five a.m.
When I need it most.
According to the clock
I can sleep seven hours before
Rock and Roll Radio wakes me up.
Lunch hour DJ good morning Rock and Roll
Are you ready to rock and roll out of bed?
Everyone else has already eaten their sandwiches
I hope you’re ready to rock steady
Because now it’s noon, you have to roll into work
The radio wills it.
Rock and Roll Radio.
The boss called me Emo today.
I think he was just calling my hair names.
My hair responses apathetically as usual.
My hair has no feelings
Least of all sad ones
I keep those all to myself
So I can cry myself to sleep
Weeping over my depressing haircut.
Bad scene
With crying girls
And cocaine
Our numbers man with blood on his hands
He saw his window of opportunity
And he punched the sombitch right in the face
And that window had it coming
Believe you me.
Word on the wire is that
My uncle has a year to live
Cancer has begun to eat his body away
He’s a member of the Sierra Club
He’s a proud Scotsman
Even has a kilt
A year from now my uncle will be underground
In a plaid skirt
He’s an avid outdoorsman
And in a year
He will become earth
My uncle has a year to live
I bet he’ll spend a lot of time
Hiking with his wife and grandson.
He will be buried along with his moustache
And his laugh
That belongs more so in a canyon
Than confined in a coffin.
I feel like a marionette
Hanging by a thread that’s wrapped
Around my neck
And You’re pulling the strings.
Tequila drinkers next to me on the south train.
Tequila is good for
The passionate and the young.
Whiskey is better for broken dreamers
“No salt! Sugar. 
And lemon. 
Just like tea.”
In my bed instead of you
I have three good books
Two notebooks, a pen, a phone
Cigarettes, an ashtray a lighter
And two cans of beer.
And a pint of whiskey.
Stories to read, a place to write stories
A means for communication
And sources of intoxication
Just like you.
But not as warm
And much more quiet.
And spread out
Silent as a streetlight
In the gutter
Next to my bed.
Seven thirty
Thank god I bought bitters
What a wonderful accoutrement
To garnish my lack of sleep.
With ice and whiskey
In a little blue mug
Meant for camping trips
Or prison camps.
Or trips to prison
Without tents
Without visiting hours.
Almost back out, finally
I came back in
Realizing that my bladder
Has a four hour time limit
A good nap. 
But not much else.
Tempted to sneaky Pete my way through work
Bourbs and ginger ale
Dash of bitters
Twist of lemon
The Jessica Special
From a special Jessica.
The most tragic of things
Is sleeping next to someone
Of great personal significance
Unable to sleep
Because my heart won’t stop pounding
Because I’m not used to sleeping with
Someone
So I lay awake
Holding a dream come true
As close as possible
Because in the morning, you never know
In the morning anything can happen
And I’d rather lie in bed
Holding my dream
Then deal with work
Or social obligations.
I’d rather drift in and out of consciousness
But never make it all the way out
Life is too short to wake up from this
If neglecting me was a profitable enterprise
You’d be a millionaire by now.
Someday, I hope I don’t care about you
As much as you don’t care about me.
One of these days, someone else will give a damn.
In Recent Memory of Trout Fishing in America.
Cold steel spinning bait thrown out
Overcastting a line to the opposite shore
Where the lure slaps at a rock before
Tumbling into a gap between the stones
Where the line snaps
And my lure is lost
Between two moss slicked stones
And the water moves along
With rapid apathy.
Sometimes, I feel as though
I should keep every good thing that
Happens to me.
A secret.
Because if anyone finds out
It may all just disappear.
Like the flame from
A birthday candle
Right After my wish
Comes true.
Cold medication.
Do you really do anything?
Supposedly you suppress coughs
And colds
But my face still leaks
Just the same
I tried four bowls of
Spicy soup
To drain away my nose
To no avail
Cold medicine
Whiskey rocks ginger ale
Rock a bye baby
Rock me to sleep
Where the cold goes away
And in the morning I wake
Or just lie in wait of morning.
Chubby checker barfly
Is just another one of you.
Gave me her number and everything.
On a napkin I’ll never use
Because I’m just not attracted to you.
Sorry sweetheart.
I’m a little bitter.
It would never work out anyway.
You should probably get drunk and forget
About me.
It’s for the best
Of both worlds
Yours and mine.
The cough came back
Come to think of it
I’m not so sure it ever left
But there it is again
At nine fifteen
Like a kiss good morning
Blown from the diseased hand
Of a leaper lying through
Teeth
Of orthodontic appeal
Brace yourself
For a perfect fit.
I met a man named Joe
And another man named Natto
I don’t remember anything we said
Bar talk is cheaper
Than the drinks.
Is there a luxury greater
Than smoking in bed?
All the money in the world
Perhaps
Or shiny cars
That smell like pine trees
Pine trees that are too
Expensive to obey speed limits.
Oh water
Restore me to my feet
My tired feet
That need three more hours
Of restless napping.
Oh water
Bathe me back to life
My tired life that needs rest
Or something like it
Oh water
Wash my glass
Give me the cold shoulder
And become ice cubes
Chill the whiskey
And water it down
Until the glass is
Only half full
Six thirty
Is no time for this shit
Or anything. 
Really.
Stupid ears
Why can’t you clean yourselves?
Why?
Not.
I sleep behind America.
Well, I would be sleeping behind America
But I can’t do that.
I’d rather sleep next to
Sleep with America
But America is just a flag
That is always sleeping
Unlike me
Who is always waking up.
My hand smells like my balls.
That’s predictable.
It’s reasonable.
Especially on a Sunday morning
When everything should smell like my balls.
Mike has a cold instead of a cat
Or a dog (or a bitch)
He had a ferret once
Last year or the one before
Can’t remember
It’s been a while
His cold gave birth to a litter
Of coughs and sneezes
And a few fevers
I took a cough home with me
He’s about six months old
I feed my cough cigarettes and beer.
He sleeps on my bed and bathes with me
In the shower
I’m not so fond of him.
But we’ve become attached to each other
I might raise him till he matures
Maybe into a cold
Or a disease
Or lung cancer
Who knows.
Maybe he’ll run away
And join the hospital.
I took my scrotum out for a spin
The other day. 
It was getting dusty
Down in the garage.
The check engine light came on
All the mechanics wanted too much money
So I sat in the garage
With the motor running.
Until the light went out.
This poem is totally going to be five lines long.
That’s real talk, I ain’t jiving you. 
Seriously
I wouldn’t pull that shit on you. 
You’re too nice
But after five lines we’re calling it quits.
“It’s pretty cool, being five lines long,” said this poem.
“You’re such a liar,” I said.
I hope the sleep study calls me back
I hope she lives with regrets
I hope I go out like fireworks
I hope Modern Drunkard likes my story
I hope the band goes on tour
I hope I can keep my job for a while
I hope this room lasts a while
I hope they find a cure
I hope I’m right about god
I hope she loves me
If all lines continue infinitely
Going on and on into the night
Then where do you draw the line?
How do you cross it?
Can a line be picked up?
Can it be stolen
Inhaled
Can it be traded bought, sold etc
Fuck Continuity
They have cutting rooms
For movies
But I want to start a dive bar
With that name
The Cutting Room
The décor would be very morbid.
The patrons would giggle about suicide.
I love everything about the morning
Except when it takes place.
Hazy Lazy beginnings
Foggy after tastes and Facial scars.
As Far as gentle is concerned, we don’t have time for that.
This is greedy, take what you can now
Famine to feasting
And punched in the neck by a pair of blue eyes with teeth.
Blue eyes and blue balls, blue skies
And just blow me.
Blown away and breathless
But this is someone else’s couch.
Casual cameos compromise integrity
Exercise caution but retain curious urges
Ruthless, relentless
And Less rest then I needed.
Sleep deprived self censor breakdowns
Leading to finger rhythm drum beats
Heartbeats and hard heavy breathing
But this is someone else’s couch.
And I didn’t even get her number.
But to sum it up in a limerick.
On my neck is a ghastly abrasion
The skin print of last night’s liaison
Why must you tease me?
When you know what your needs be
Leaving graffiti to mark the occasion.

Or Exercises in Post Modern Prose.
Huge Throbbing punks answer collect calls from receptionists on lunch break
This is a time for bitch lore told by ghost story sellouts,
Reading off a phone pole six inches deep with concert flyers.
Mourning hymns greet sunrise processions; Death hungover at a funeral party,
Always chasing skirts.
Death is a dirty flirt and always first on the scene.
I sit on the shoulders of giants and gentleman,
Singing anthems to lightning bugs.
Woah ho hooo is a new face;
Sound resounding in echo shots off the canyons of mind space.
My flaxen haired princess dancing with seven veils in silhouettes on a cave wall.
Finding only puppets and pretenders we soldier on,
Searching lurching; Motion sick on an oil slick of loose change.
Each page a variable lexicon in process,
And a sign on the door reads �Out to Lunch.�
Drift drifting swift dynamis, A shift winded long;
A love affair with a fair haired harlot,
Scarlet lady with seductress eyes; Smiles.
I�m skipping beats and thirty-three and a third in the passenger side of the carpool lane.
My driver reeks of whiskey and Camel Lights.
He�s yelling over the stereo; A Siren�s song in futility.
The things we do for Tequila Tuesday.
Always along for the ride, we take back streets.
Fast food wrappers and cigarette remains litter what once was a floor.
The back seat passenger is an assortment of possibly laundered wardrobery.
We speed down, whipping around corners in search of coroners and
Rest in peace.
Transitions don�t come easy.
I�m the beat down of a morning erection,
While the red-haired green-eyed bride of Satan sings old songs with burnouts and punks in the back room of a coffee house.
On a sidewalk couples stride hand in hand along side third wheel friendships;
Snide jokes written margin-side to amuse the perceptive.
Jesus! Someone�s going to have hell to pay.
We are blasphemers in debtor�s prison; This purgatory of princes.
I make no promises of sense-making in these brief moments of sobriety.
Third minds drift by the wayside,
Seeds sown sans care by dirt merchants and mediocre scam artists;
Self absorbed attention whores, drunk off years of neglect.
The first one�s always free.
Soldier on little lover, someday your heart will race
A tour d� force, cyclically.
You�re a adorable in your own way; Faint smiles and quiet words whispered in tandem.
Persons and people watchers, content to observer, never missing moments.
We stand adrift in the shallows, afraid of depth and the dangers lurking therein.
Neon signs bark in color code at strangers and street preachers,
Sipping away at pink slips while cloudy headed muses shout from rooftops via the mouths of suicide youths.
Self destructive simpletons drinking themselves to a glorious oblivion.
Snoring on sidewalks, an androgynous bi-polarity spins like a yin-yang.
Constants flux, a redux of yesterday in detail.
Red dressed vixens beat in time with a funeral brigade,
A parade of peacocks in full bloom spread plumage like fanned out Tarot cards;
The Fool in Kether.
Summer storms wash away muggy memories of nights previous.
Thunder rattles the windows of old Colonials
Sending shivers of ancient nightmares to the sleeping minds of infants.
Well rounded table nights and five card studs makes bets against the odds.
Crack a bottle with a bic; Suds explosion followed by table mopping behind fluorescent beer signs,
Previously hung where steins were lifted.
Cannon fodder fiddlers sing ballads behind empty hats,
Parole officer shake downs spread fear along paranoid paths,
Catching in well made traps the down trodden.
No body wins the spite game.
Back and forth motivated members make a mockery of all things sacred.
Seductress in a red dress stands under a street light,
A solitary soldier of vice,
The Spice of Life.
These tales told ad nauseum, this mausoleum of scripts written cryptically,
Full of resounding non-chalance. 
We sit on doorsteps steeped in funnel cake memories
Watching carpet baggers peddle wares from house to house.
In the face of absolute terror
Pan pipes smoke via ventilation shafts
Billowing on pillows we sit, my friends and I
Drunkenly inhaling.
Sweating and restlessness set in.
You see, the reason we aren�t so close is that I simply can�t risk falling in love with you.
Saunter and sway, slow motion collapse.
Head held by hands not his
Rousing eye slits crack to light blinding flashes
Reflexive defensive mechanisms shut it out again.
Fever fever, inferno on a forehead.
One extra to keep an eye on heaven.
Kittens snore sofa-side
Down syndrome eyes and autistic grins showing the first signs of sadism.
Hell no! You�re a crazy bitch!
Snap shots hung with magnets pull you in
Same sages burn brushes still fresh and saffron red.
Bread bakers rise early at optimal temperatures
Engaging in life long yeast adventures.
Indulge your petty preoccupations,
Predict fear and project vanity.
The soul pours in draughts during droughts
Doubting the return of a messiah in bell-bottoms.
Clean shaven sons of sacrifice pledge their lives on TV screens.
This is a test of the will on it�s own terms.
She�s in the restroom powdering her nose
In a stall with the powder in her lap and a veil over her face.
She cuts up lines.
Heaven words bound,
Prometheus is fucking Theophobia in an hourglass.
This mythical masturbation; Beowulf in shepherd�s clothing
And a little child shall deceive them.
We toss coins in trinities pretending they are sticks
And stones will break my adulterous bones, said She.
Try fatalism on for size.
Not so much an outfit as it is a mob.
Mentality speeds down a mounting password
Accessible over changed-linked fences
Expecting spenders we settle for fifteen percent.
It�s enough to get us in the door,
But Knocking is for guests.
We turn the knob by remembering it isn�t there
And so we turn the hourglass over, reversing the cowgirl.
Isis in a ten gallon hat with a sheriff�s badge.
She�ll have a Madonna on the rocks and I�ll have the same.
But we don�t smoke rocks, we chase dragons.
St. 
George in his birthday suit ferries us across the Styx,
Humming Credence Clearwater Revival.
Summer storms in like a soliloquy on an empty stage,
Hailing in pebbles stinging sideways due to wind change.
This light shows sizable these seated statues;
Bobbing plastic birds to drink.
Houses of non-merriment pent up to the ceiling with socialites.
Pitcher chase after DUI pursuits; We rest up.
Our knives are stained from sitting fire side
In between rings of glowing coils.
We billow in beer bottle hooters,
Sucking up our guts as girls process in succession
Ascending to throne rooms with hair held back,
This reckless infatuation crashes in a furious flurry of sparks.
Ebb and flow like a hustler, beckon to shadows and cloaked in whispers.
I�ve met some shady characters.
Persist and perspire.
He holds his knees chin-ward, wallowing in self pity.
It�s the little victories, really.
He told me good things happen to good people,
And I wanted to punch his ignorant mouth.
They made a mockery of his affections
And sport of his sincerity.
He�s a Polaroid head case; Flashing in moments of clarity
These wishes of divine singularity,
Singing all the while, �We shall overcome.�
This masochistic streak leaves me with naught but an empty wallet and desperation.
Oh, that there were streams of stars,
All scuttlebutt and no noise.
We pick up again at the drop of a needle,
Vastly imbalanced now.
Chemical arrest is one way to put it.
Curiouser and curiouser,
Down into the habit hole.
A photo finish of sorts; This business.
We digress in unison riding passenger side on the omnibus.
I said it all in capitol letters;
That Stupid Son Of A Bitch.
In the hour of transition into a butterfly, I cocoon.
Amored up we lunge into this plunging motion.
A morose reminder tacked in sticky notes.
Quiver erroneously; shivers in this chill factor
Sends breaks to snake charmers.
Focus! Focus on these,
This ink stained hocus pocus.
Write out of love, out of spite.
Spit fire and breath venom vehemently.
Cowardly staring at conflict we resolve to opting out entirely.
Intimate plans best laid to rest
These times that test the unbroken men,
In droves they wait in line for words to say;
Tongue-tied orators tease in paragraphs
Using bullshit prose like matadors in heat.
Crumbly bums make their way to Greyhound launchpads;
Life couches sans a fairy godmother.
We dance at two steps up flights of stairs
Amidst stares and glaring streetlight serenades.
My baby lobbing grenades into the lobby of the State Street Motel.
Vacant stares, previously vacant stairs now occupied by chain smoking adolescents.
You and me baby, until the sun burns out.
Conversation play out over loud speakers on sets designed by opium addicts.
God bless the word junkies
Getting kicks from a thesaurus.
Cold fingers etching rigor mortis post-mortem pen vomit
Cock teases strip paint off the ceiling
Rocking on to aerobics videos,
Eating hotdogs out of buns of steel.
Catch that dawn light in a cab ride,
Hold it in the palm of your hand on the doorstep of the crash space you call home.
Use it to light that last cigarette.
Sit and decipher these hand written sloppy love letters to the damned.
Chapter One: Introductions are a waste of your time and mine.
French fries cook best at around three hundred and twenty-five degrees Fahrenheit. 
Oskar lights the pilot, cranks the dial and sets the baskets in place. 
He wipes a hand on his apron and checks his drawer full of frozen fries. 
Two large brown paper sacks fresh from the freezer. 
In fifteen minutes, a small printer will tick off orders. 
One after another for six hours. 
In six hours, Oskar’s arms will be pock marked with little red dots. 
A constellation of grease burns covering his arms. 
A scrapbook of scars cataloging every time he dropped a basket with a little too much force. 
Every time he got in a hurry to get a plate of fries to some slob with a hankering for a burger. 
There are three other employees at Berger Haus at any given time. 
A guy washing dishes, some girl behind the counter taking orders and the burger cook. 
The burger cook was the guy in charge when the owner wasn’t around. 
The owner wasn’t around much and the guy on the flattop grill ran the kitchen like he missed his bus. 
He would holler at Oskar, at the counter girl and the dishwasher. 
Every word out of his mouth degrading, demeaning and often deranged. 
His name was Camron. 
He was a dick. 
The girl behind the counter would listen to his verbal assaults on Oskar. 
His tirades on the dishwasher. 
She’d roll her eyes and take orders from the line of college students, lunch break business suits, and the lucky bum that managed a handful of sympathy change. 
Her name was Dakota and she was hired to look just pretty enough in a polo shirt and a pair of jeans. 
She wasn’t required to smile in the employee handbook. 
A detail that never occurred to her. 
She never read employee handbooks. 
Javier stands in the dish pit. 
His tattoos seep out from under his sleeves. 
There’s a sideways cross on his left hand. 
An intricate pattern of dots on his left. 
The Virgin of Guadalupe covers his entire back. 
He has teardrops on his face; three open, two closed. 
Between his thumb and forefinger is a cross with three beams of light emanating from the center. 
His arms have names written in cursive, in old English script. 
He doesn’t talk much. 
Not to Oskar, not to Camron, not to Dakota. 
“Hey chief, I needed five orders of fries yesterday. 
What the fuck are you doing over there? Play with your dick on your own time.”
Oskar mumbles to himself, he mumbles like, “pinche pendejo puto. 
“ That fuckin’ Camron and his stupid burger spatula. 
His stupid little hat. 
His smirk. 
The cocky little fuck. 
Like flipping burgers makes him the king of the block. 
Oskar dropped a basket of fries and felt the raindrops of black fry oil speckle his arm. 
Que toda mierda. 
Oskar pulls the fries up from the fryer. 
He dumps them in a four inch deep metal pan. 
Takes a handful of salt and sprinkles it liberally over the lot. 
He tosses everything around and divides it up between five cardboard boxes with red and white checker picnic patterns on the bottom. 
He slaps a bell on the counter between his station and the front of the Berger Haus. 
On cue, Dakota takes the boxes, slides them into paper bags with burgers, packets of catsup, packets of black pepper, packets of mustard, mayonnaise, and salt. 
Takes a handful of napkins and carries all the bags to the pick-up window.
Outside the Berger Haus are two lines of people. 
One is waiting to order, the other is waiting to pick up. 
In the line waiting to pick-up, waiting for a hot burger and a box of fries is a woman with a bike. 
She has short purple hair and a messenger bag. 
The difference is that she actually carries messages. 
Her long muscular legs crossed on a bench, he arms folded neatly on her chest, she gets up to get a bag and bike away to a nice stairwell. 
A perfectly cozy lunch nook. 
Somewhere shaded. 
Somewhere quiet. 
She has twenty minutes to cross town and drop off three large manila envelopes at two different office buildings. 
She will be ten minutes early, even with a burger inside her.
Javier is pulling two boxes of frozen burgers out of the freezer. 
He drops the boxes at Camron’s feet and walks back to the dish pit. 
Runs a few loads through the machine. 
Sprays off a few trays, a few pans. 
Watches the red brown water wash off of old patties run down the sink into the drain and down into the floor. 
Javier cracks his knuckles, pops his shoulder. 
The cross on his hand denotes that he was a weapons supplier. 
The dots indicate his resume. 
His biography could be summed up like cuidado, puta madre. 
“The fuck man?” Camron is all kinds of offended. 
He’s not at all happy about the box of frozen beef dropped on his floor. 
At his feet. 
A backhanded favor. 
Javier just looks at him. 
Javier does not smile, he doesn’t shift. 
The look on his face is as blank like a new chalk board, as hollow as a gun barrel on a starless night. 
Camron doesn’t have a lot to say to a face like that. 
Camron sees the ink on Javier’s neck. 
On his sleeves, his hands. 
He sees the tattoos and only knows a kind of primal fear. 
He flips a burger into its own grease. 
Camron says, “Fuck.”
Oskar isn’t a tough guy. 
I’m just going to put that out there. 
Oskar is the kind of guy that knows trouble on the horizon. 
He knows that shit is going to hit the fan. 
About that time, he’ll find a way out. 
He’ll make some distance between himself and danger. 
He’d rather not get involved. 
The sound of his madre in a rage in the back of his head. 
“You’re just like your father! Pendejo! Aye Christo.” And she would shake her head. 
She would be so very disappointed. 
“We’re clear.” Dakota walks through the kitchen and out to the back alley by the trashcans, the dumpster. 
The pile of cardboard boxes. 
She lights a menthol cigarette and sits on a milk crate. 
Oskar follows her out, rolls one up on his leg while leaning against a blue recycling bin. 
He lights and they smoke together, not saying a word. 
She finishes first and stubs out her smoke on the bottom of her shoe. 
Flicks her butt over the back fence and walks back into man the register. 
She’s really good at leaning on things and tapping buttons.
Oskar lingers outside. 
He blows his smoke at the mid afternoon sky. 
His breath comes in large bursts of white cloud smoke. 
Just when he’s feeling good about it, Camron sticks his stupid face around the corner. 
“Get your ass back in here, holmes.” That pinche guerro. 
There are only a few more hours in the day. 
There are only a few more days in the year. 
There are only a few more years left in a lifetime. 
Oskar doesn’t see this going anywhere. 
I mean, he appreciates having a job, making rent, paying his phone bill and everything. 
But there’s got to be a better way to make a living. 
Oskar drops basket after basket of fries. 
He seasons them, portions them out and restocks. 
It’s a routine that lets his mind wander. 
He wanders all over the place. 
Often he wanders into Dakota’s pants. 
She’s got a boyfriend is what he heard. 
She doesn’t really care is also what he’s heard. 
He hears a lot of things. 
Sometimes he thinks he would have been better conceived as nothing more than a giant ear. 
Just a big drum for people to blah blah blah into. 
His mind wanders to the clock and it’s already time to get out of there and thank god. 
Oskar walks home. 
The walk takes about an hour. 
He’s dreamed of owning a car. 
He’s thought about buying a bike. 
He’s considered investing in some kind of transportation device that didn’t have laces. 
Not once has there been any follow through. 
He thinks, maybe if I had a car I could talk to girls. 
Maybe all those smoke breaks with Dakota would turn into kisses, make out sessions, maybe even sex. 
Maybe a car with a big back seat. 
A big back seat to have sex in. 
That would be pinche dulce.
The living situation is like this. 
There’s an apartment on the shitty side of town. 
There are two guys on the lease; Oskar and his roommate, Todd. 
Todd got a lucky break a few years back. 
He cashed in on some internet thing. 
Threw some inheritance money at a company that sold out to the tune of twenty million. 
His timing was perfect. 
He hasn’t worked a real job in his life. 
He’s twenty eight and he’s pretty much retired. 
He doesn’t leave the house much. 
He’s very determined to hold on to that money as long as possible. 
Todd spends his time taking a lot of naps. 
He spends a lot of his time on his computer watching short videos of other people doing things.
Oskar walks in the door. 
He checks the mail, hangs up his keys and takes off his shoes, placing them next to the door. 
“Dude, you’ve gotta see this shit. 
I found this video of a guy running around with a dog in his arms. 
Except the thing is he fed the dog cans and cans of chili. 
Like, so much fuckin’ chili it’s ridiculous. 
Then he runs around and asks people to hold his dog while he talks to them. 
And the dog, that fuckin’ dog just blows up all over the place! Shitting chili everywhere! It’s fucking hilarious.” Todd is on the couch in a bathrobe. 
The television is on. 
A constant stream of science fiction movies. 
He doesn’t bother to look up when he talks to people. 
He doesn’t spend much time looking people in the eyes. 
He prefers screens. 
“I just posted a link to it. 
You should check it out. 
It’ll make your day.” Todd laughs to himself. 
He laughs kind of like a zebra. 
Kind of like horse. 
“Maybe later, I’m fuckin’ beat.” Oskar pushes the door to his room open. 
He falls on his bed facedown. 
He doesn’t move for four hours. 
Chapter Two: A bike between the legs is worth more than a punch in the face.
The eastside is a lovely grid. 
This makes most of the work pretty easy. 
Peddle and push and pump the handle bars. 
Purple hair in the wind, the constant crank of the chain on the gears. 
Little hills here and there are like rewards. 
A nice downhill coast. 
Put the bitch in cruise control. 
The girl can dance on two wheels. 
I suppose that’s why her name was Cha Cha. 
Cha Cha O’Henry, courier for hire. 
A burger in the gut will fuel your body for a few hours, give or take. 
A box of fries will keep you going a couple more miles. 
Homegirl is flying through the streets. 
Her ass hardly touches the seat. 
She shifts gears by feel, moving on and moving fast. 
A complex of offices sits on the corner near a shopping center. 
One of those one stop and get it all kind of places. 
A business park, they call it. 
There isn’t a swing set in sight. 
Cubicles in cubes of concrete and glass. 
Boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes. 
And they all sit down at desks, answering phones, directing calls, forwarding email. 
Some are in meetings right now, talking about charts and graphs. 
Making presentations about some money making plan. 
Trying to keep the company afloat until this year’s vacation. 
This year’s staff barbeque. 
Cha Cha runs the maze of partitions like a mouse in a lab. 
She finds the receptionist’s desk and drops a thick manila envelope on top. 
“Got something for a Mister Larkin.” She says.
“Mister Larkin is on vacation.” The receptionist says. 
She pushes a pair of glasses up her nose with her ring finger.
“Could you just sign for it and leave it on his desk?”
“Sure. 
I suppose.” The receptionist takes a black ball point pen and signs her name. 
She takes the package and drops in a pile of papers in a box labeled, “out”.
“Thanks a bunch!” And Cha Cha walks out of one office and into the elevator. 
Does the same dance two more times and hops back on her bike. 
Her phone rings and it’s the dispatcher. 
His name is Clyde and he’s a voice that guides the flow of information. 
“Pick up at the office, O’Henry. 
Two more deliveries for the day, take it or leave it.”
“I’ll take it. 
Thanks Clyde.”
And our girl bikes off into the distance, hoping to wrap up the day by six. 
Thinking about that cold pint of beer waiting for her on top of the bar that resides underneath her quaint studio on the south end of town. 
That beer is going to taste amazing. 
That beer could change her life. 
Cha Cha lives and dies by her watch. 
Timing is everything. 
Speed is valuable beyond belief. 
In her world, a flat tire could ruin everything. 
But for now, everything is going smoothly. 
Right now, her day has been one A to B to another. 
Crisscrossing town at a rapid fire rate. 
Memorized pavement, street signs, and every short cut possible. 
Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry part one:
She’s named after a dance of Cuban origin. 
Her father (Irish) died of a rare bone disease back in the day. 
Her family is a mother (Cuban), one sister (older), one brother (also older), an uncle (in prison), and one grandfather (old and drunk). 
She’s close to her mother and closer to her brother. 
Her sister hasn’t spoken to her in years. 
She has a college degree in art history. 
She’s something of a stargazer. 
She really loves coffee. 
Long walks on the beach are overrated. 
And she’ll take a slice of pie over cake any day. 
Her most common form of self expression is changing her hair color. 
She considers t-shirts a valid medium for statement. 
Sometimes she plays the piano, but only at the store with the baby grand that’s out of tune. 
Her eyes change color between green and blue. 
She’ll tell you it changes because of the weather. 
That’s a good start. 
Look forward to the next installment of Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry. 
The dispatch is really a warehouse. 
There’s a desk with two phones. 
A filing cabinet, some pallets. 
Rows of shelving. 
Mostly the place is home to a small team of odd job enthusiasts. 
There’s a guy that hops from one classified section to another, looking for some job he’s never done before. 
He’ll lie over the phone about experience and see what happens. 
There’s a girl that bakes medicinal cookies. 
There’s a house band that only plays at house parties. 
They’re going to make it big someday. 
Just you wait.
“Punch it in the face like you’re married to it!” Some guy is holding up a crash test dummy and another is wearing boxing gloves. 
The guy wearing the gloves is bouncing back and forth on his feet. 
He swings at the dummy, punching it left- right- left, over and over again.
“Barbara Waxbusch was the greatest female vocalist that ever lived.” Clyde is sitting behind the desk in a rolling office chair. 
He rolls around on the bare concrete between a filing cabinet and the desk. 
He pulls a magazine out of one of the drawers and hands it to Cha Cha. 
He pushes his glasses up his nose. 
“Ever heard of her?” She shakes her head. 
“Barbara Waxbusch was just a pseudonym.” Cha Cha looks at the magazine; on the cover is a woman dressed in black leather biker gear. 
She has a black leather cap cocked on the side of her head. 
She’s posed to look like a bad ass. 
With heavy makeup and all the trimmings of the thing they call rock and roll. 
“She had something of a cult following back in the late seventies. 
Mostly in upstate New York. 
Somewhere around Ithaca.” Clyde shuffles two manila envelopes around on the desktop. 
He adjusts his glasses.
Cha Cha turns to a page. 
There’s Ms. 
Waxbusch, leaning against a speaker. 
Looking all sexy like. 
The article is mostly pictures of Ms. 
Waxbusch in various poses, with various pieces of musical equipment. 
The text is squeeze in between shots of Barbara gradually stripping down to nothing but a fancy hat and long black socks.
“One more! C’mon Marvin, fuck this guy up!” The boxer takes a step back and using the full force of his weight, twisting his leg and torso into his shoulder into his arm into his fist into the face of the dummy. 
The guy holding it up staggers back and falls on the ground. 
The Dummy falls right on top of him, the way an empire falls due to famine or plague. 
The guy gets up and leaves his empire behind.
He’s all like, “Damn Marvin.”
And Marvin’s all like, “Yeah.”
O’Henry closes the magazine and drops it back down on the desk. 
“And? Is there a reason you’re telling me this?” She asks.
“No, not really. 
I just thought you’d be the type of person that would appreciate her music. 
No more, no less.” He shuffles the envelopes again. 
“Seriously, you should check her out.”
“Awesome. 
Thanks for the hot tip.” She picks up the envelopes and looks at the addresses. 
“How long do I have?”
“An hour for both of them. 
They’re not too far apart. 
Should be a piece of cake.”
“Yeah sure. 
No problem.” Cha Cha puts the envelopes in her bag. 
She turns to go. 
“Thanks Clyde!”
“Don’t forget, listen to some Barbara Waxbusch.” Clyde slides his glasses up his nose and runs a hand through his hair.
Chapter Three: These poles were made for dancing. 
And that’s just what they’ll do.
The first thing that you’ll notice when you walk into the club is the air. 
You could say that the air was heavy, seemingly smoky but not a cigar in sight. 
The purple plush upholstery stood around in dimly lit alcoves. 
One thing you will not notice is the gentlemen. 
For this is a gentlemen’s club.
In the middle of the room, on a stage surrounded by chairs, there’s a pole bolted to the ceiling and the floor. 
The pole shines gold in the spotlights. 
The bass of the subwoofer vibrates everything in the room. 
Paintings hang on the red velvet walls. 
On the stage in the middle of the room a girl and a pole are doing their thing. 
Around and around she goes. 
Dollar bills are thrown at her feet, on the stage. 
This one guy stacks them up in a pyramid. 
The sound track is heavy with butt-rock, dance techno, and gangsta rap.
The girl on the stage is a whirl of veils falling around a burnt sugar skin tone muscular legs like a tri-athlete. 
She swims around the pole in a cycle, running a routine of desire, enticing, icing on the cake. 
Her flesh glimmers with sweat when she drops her ass down, when she crawls across the stage towards the man with the pyramid scheme. 
The girl tells the guy to move closer. 
She breaths in his ear, guides his face between her tits, rubs her head in the crotch of his pants. 
She bites his zipper and pulls away slow, burning his eyes with desire and lust. 
The song ends and the girl picks up the dollars thrown around on the stage. 
Crawling on her hands and knees. 
The DJ says,
“Give it up for Takira! Takira will be around on the floor if you liked what you saw. 
Show her some love and buy a dance. 
Up next is Ginny! Be sure to hit of the bar because right now is happy hour! Two for one shots of well vodka.” The DJ pushes a button that cues up a CD on a large console. 
He lets the music take over and sits back.
“Nice work baby.” A fat man in an expensive suit gives her a kiss as she walks off the stage. 
She has her costume in one hand and a wad of cash in another. 
She picks up a small lock box from the side of the stage, quickly counts the money and puts it inside. 
Locks the box and walks backstage. 
She puts her box in a locker with her name on it. 
Takira slips back into her costume and wipes the sweat off her face. 
She takes a moment to sit down, spray a little perfume on. 
Straightens her hair and make any adjustments before stepping back out on to the floor.
As she walks out a man wearing his sunglasses approaches. 
“Hey there, nice moves.”
“Thanks,” she says.
“How about a dance? How long will 40 bucks get me?”
“Two songs.”
“Alright,” he says, “let’s do this.”
“Could you give me a minute? Let a girl get a drink?” She walks to the bar, not giving him time. 
She’s going to get that drink before anything else. 
She’s going to talk to the bartender before giving another show. 
The bartender is a woman in her thirties. 
Used to be a dancer, now just works the drinks. 
Her makeup is heavy and her cleavage stands out of her vest like two synchronized swimmers coming up for air after the routine is all over. 
She’s a tough mother hen sweetheart with a mean penchant for sequins. 
Her name is Sandra Clamshell but everyone around here calls her Sandy.
“Sandy, baby, I need a shot.” Takira leans heavy on the bar top, arching her back and jutting her ass out just a bit. 
“Still drinking bourbon?” She asks.
“Is the sun still handing out cancer?”
Sandy turns and grabs a glass and a bottle and pours and puts it down. 
Takira takes the shot down and sighs big like, ahh that was nice. 
“What’s with that guy with the glasses,” Takira asks.
“Dunno. 
Never seen him around here before.” Sandy leans on the well, getting closer and quieter. 
“He was standing in the back watching you dance. 
Never moved. 
Never bought a drink. 
Kinda creepy.”
“Huh, strange. 
Could I get one more? I’d like to get this dance over with and get out of here.” Takira slides the glass over to Sandy’s hand. 
“Sure thing, honey. 
I’d like to get the hell out of here myself.”
Takira takes down the shot, says thanks, and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. 
She walks back to the dude in the sunglasses. 
She says, “Still want that dance sir?”
And he says, “Yes ma’am.”
She turns to look at him for a second. 
He has a goofy smile on his face, like he’s never done this before. 
He’s got those sunglasses on despite the dim lights. 
His hair is greasy; his nose is flat and wide. 
He has an ugly moustache. 
His chins prickle with stubble. 
There’s an old coat wrapped around his body. 
The kind you can get at the flea market or the Good Will on a bad day. 
He looks like his name should be Chester.
“My name is Chester,” he says, walking in the private dance room.
“That so?” says Takira, closing the door behind her. 
She goes right to work. 
Walking over in time to the music she stands in front of the small couch where Chester sits. 
She dances a little in place, just curving her body like a snake that’s been charmed. 
She looks him up and down.
“Franco’s pissed.” Chester sits calmly, like a lawyer. 
“He knows about the kid.” He talks like an accountant.
And just like that. 
Seven words just ruined someone’s day. 
A little someone named Takira Sunrise.
“Oh Fuck You!” Takira looks for something to throw at Chester. 
A vase perhaps. 
Maybe an old telephone, the kind with a rotary dial. 
The kind that weighed a good twelve pounds. 
She’s mad now.
“Look lady, I’m just a messenger, alright? Don’t get all pissed off at me just because some shit just hit your fan.” Still he has his hands folded neatly in his lap. 
“What the fuck does that bastard want with me? And I swear if he lays a finger on my fucking baby...” She gasps for breath. 
She looks at Chester like he has some kind of say in this. 
He’s not that guy. 
He’s just the fucking messenger. 
“Woah, woah, woah. 
Easy now. 
No need for those kinds of theatrics. 
Franco doesn’t want to hurt the kid. 
Trust me. 
That’s the last thing he wants. 
But Franco hates secrets, you know? Doesn’t like to be left out the picture. 
Shit like that really pisses Franco off. 
And when Franco get’s pissed off, someone needs to cheer him up. 
Someone needs to do Franco a favor.” Chester pulls a tri-folded stack of papers from the inside pocket of his coat. 
He unfolds them and hands them to Takira. 
“Franco needs a favor or some might get hurt.”
One of the papers is a photocopy of a photograph of the kid in question. 
Takira’s son.
“How did he… Oh god…” Takira looks at more of the papers. 
There a map with markings on it. 
There’s a list of names.
“A map and a list of names. 
That’s what you’ve got. 
The people on this list all owe something to Franco. 
He’d be very pleased if motions were made to expedite the process in which those persons pay Franco what they owe.” Just another day at the office for this guy. 
And it’s a hell of an office. 
Believe you me.
“Wait. 
You want me to extort some people? Don’t you have like, tough guys for that shit? I mean, fuck, look at me. 
I’m like five foot two. 
I weigh like ninety pounds.”
“You weigh one hundred and twenty-five pounds. 
And most of it is muscle. 
You work out a lot. 
We know. 
We also know a bit more of the story. 
A few things a working girl like yourself would tastefully leave off a resume.” Chester gets up and walks to the door. 
He turns before opening the door. 
“Figure it out. 
You’ll be hearing from us.” And he closes the door behind him.
Takira slumps over. 
She says, “Aw. 
Fuck.”
Chapter Four: On the fair banks of the olde harbor town.
It’s hard work, being an investor. 
At least that’s what I’ve heard. 
I’ve never had the pleasure first hand. 
But from what I’ve seen investors do, what I’ve heard around is that investing is hard work. 
It’s like a really drawn out gambling game. 
Say you’ve got some excess money. 
Let’s say you’re feeling a little adventurous. 
Let’s say you’re feeling like you want to be a part of something greater then yourself. 
And there’s this company. 
Usually a small company with some fresh new ideas and a gang of lovable losers with the skill to pull it off. 
They just need the overhead. 
They just need that money for things like a real printer and a copier. 
A new computer that doesn’t crash as often as the old ones. 
Some decent recording equipment. 
A company car for company purposes.
Anita Fairbanks is one of those investor types. 
She’s sitting on a bit of money. 
Back in the late seventies she was at the right place at the right time. 
That bit of luck has lasted her well into right about now. 
Right about now she’s thinking it’s time to throw that money into politics. 
Big business. 
She’s thinking that boyish senator looks like a sure win. 
I mean hell, she’d vote for him. 
She’s comfortable enough with his politics. 
With the way he gives speeches. 
Mrs. 
Fairbanks is a widower. 
Her third husband died of an opiate overdose five years ago. 
She really thought it would work out this time. 
He wasn’t the greatest of men, nor the worst. 
He had a kind heart and a way with words. 
Part time philanthropist, part time womanizer, part time junkie. 
Said he couldn’t help himself. 
Those addictions were just too good. 
Too hard to let go of. 
Then too much to handle. 
Anita is the Spanish form of Anne. 
Anne means favor or grace. 
A graceful little favor. 
I suppose that’s exactly what she was up to. 
Providing graceful little favors to politicians. 
Keeping the campaign afloat. 
Floating like the boats out in the old harbor.
There’s a boat out there with her name on it. 
It’s painted in green. 
A flowing freehand script. 
It looks nice. 
Even in the fog. 
The sky in the old harbor town is a blend of grays. 
The clouds are well layered here. 
Like a cake made from humidity and depression. 
The rain comes and goes and comes back again to hang around. 
The rain keeps making excuses to stop by. 
Like, oh I seem to have left my glasses over, could I swing by and pick them up? I’ll only be a minute. 
Or, do you have a good hat I could borrow? See, there’s this thing tonight and I really need a hat to go. 
Without a hat, I’d just look silly.
Anita takes a pack of slim 100s. 
She sits on the deck of her quaint little house by its cozy little harbor town. 
She lights a long thin cigarette and lets her eyelids down a few degrees. 
She sighs and looks out at the harbor. 
The sail boats and schooners. 
A couple of yachts. 
A yacht club with matching weather stained wood siding. 
Woodpecker Swiss cheese telephone poles and rusted cars. 
It was such a nice, quiet town. 
Anita moved north when the city started to destroy her. 
She had a reputation, she was considered privileged. 
The way was paved for party all the time- push- shove-push it harder all the time and never a break just going and running wild with every turn burning down in little spoons and soon shall be injected into the flesh to the bone to heart to the head the brain and blood stream and then…
Anita drags on her cigarette. 
Just drags and drags. 
The wrinkles in her fingers and the wrinkles in her face the lines of worry on her eyebrows and bloodshot eyeballs the shakes. 
The fucking shakes again. 
Anita drags on her cigarette. 
She flicks and shakes and drags on her cigarette. 
A little stream of ashes falling like Pompeii snowflakes on to the weather stained deck attached to the quaint little harbor town home.
Her half brother lives down south. 
In the thick city. 
The city where the noise and the speed, the lights and sounds all collide and amplify, echoing on and on and on. 
She can’t really go back to that city. 
She’d rather not go back to any city. 
It’s not that she’s old. 
She looks and feels older than she is. 
But she’s been there and done that and knows there’s nothing but trouble. 
Her son’s down there too. 
Down there with her half brother. 
Right in the thick of it.
That poor little bastard, she thinks rolling the butt of her now extinguished, now put out, now nothing but a filter from a cigarette. 
Her poor bastard son. 
She tried. 
There were schools and teachers and priests and pastors, after school activity clubs and sports teams. 
Every distraction from the streets. 
From making those kinds of friends. 
The ones that get into to trouble. 
The kind that have a roll of money all to themselves.
It didn’t take long. 
Not that long at all, really. 
First there were the detentions, the suspensions. 
Parent teacher conferences, school transfers, attendance records. 
There was no stopping him once he got started. 
Pretty soon he just stopped coming home unless he was hungry. 
Unless sales were down. 
Unless he just wanted an excuse to show up and let his mom know he wasn’t dead yet. 
She never done him wrong and he knew that. 
She wasn’t around much either. 
She had things to do and people to see and parties to go to. 
And the boy’s father. 
Well, let’s just say he was before husband number one. 
He didn’t bother to keep in touch. 
He just kinda, disappeared. 
Step dad number one was a whole big barrel of fun and old money. 
He just paid for everything, that big fat beautiful man. 
Took to looking after Anita. 
Making sure she had a nice dress to wear. 
Made sure she had her fill of little shrimp cocktails with plenty of Heinz 57. 
Then the fat fuck had to go and have a stroke. 
Just broke Anita’s little heart. 
She couldn’t very well stay married to a half man half vegetable. 
He was just so needy and useless after that. 
Anita wasn’t a caregiver. 
Was never in her blood. 
Her mom didn’t baby her, she didn’t baby nobody neither. 
It wasn’t a bad thing, exactly. 
I mean, that’s a good way to learn a few keys to survival. 
You ain’t got nobody but you, babe. 
Better learn to live with yourself and make the most of things. 
You’re a human being just like the rest of us. 
Stop making excuses and do something about it. 
That’s your gift as a human. 
That magical quality that put you at the top of the food chain. 
The divorce was finalized and Anita didn’t get much of anything in the settlement. 
Time to start over again. 
So she packed up and headed west. 
The land of sunshine and opportunity. 
To some exciting new career in something or other. 
Onward, to destiny.
Destiny came in the form of a lawyer all to herself. 
The man was handsome and well connected. 
He wasn’t a court lawyer like they have on the television. 
He was a company lawyer, the kind that draws up papers for one company to merge with another company. 
A mergers and acquisitions kind of guy. 
The kind of guy that would take you out for a nice steak on the weekend. 
Take you out to the rock and roll clubs at night. 
Take off your shoes for you. 
Take a line of coke off your cleavage. 
Destiny gave Anita Fairbanks the best sex of her life.
And of course he cheated on her. 
Then she cheated on him. 
Then they got married and had more sex behind each other’s back then they would together in the same room. 
Sometimes when you get good at something you just have to see how much better you can get. 
Now you’re curious. 
Now you’re wondering, how much farther I can take this. 
Where can this road go except up? And what do you mean there’s a top to this hill we’re climbing. 
What’d you mean there’s a cliff on the other side?
This time the divorce was really messy. 
There were TV crews and radio reporters and newspaper men. 
There was a lot of publicity and tabloids. 
It was the worst month of either of their lives. 
It was the kind of thing that could only happen in a town like Hollywood or Miami. 
That left Anita with a reputation and a track record. 
She was the talk of the town for days. 
She had to leave. 
She needed her space. 
This? This just wasn’t working out.
North bound and she bought a coat and everything. 
Swore off men and marriage and left her kid behind in the city he called home to fend for himself. 
Just like he’d been doing all along. 
Mrs. 
Fairbanks went up north. 
She found a nice little harbor town with a quaint little dock. 
She found a kind older gentleman that owned a sturdy old yacht. 
She changed her named to Anita and planned on settling down. 
She planned on getting used to the cold weather and the clouds and the sweet older gentleman that would bring her flowers that he cut out of the neighbor’s garden in the morning before they woke up. 
She even liked the sound of her new name. 
Anita Fairbanks has a much more pleasant ring to it than Barbara Waxbusch.
Chapter Five:  The Grease Trap.
In the floor of every restaurant with a fryer, in every restaurant with a lot of oil waste, there’s a grease trap. 
The grease trap filters out the solid chucks of solidified fat and oil that make their way down the drain. 
They come in a variety of shapes and sizes. 
They need a good pumping from a rooter service every once in a while. 
What happens if the trap doesn’t get pumped? All that shitty water from leftover food, old grease, and ancient burger fat comes up and out of the trap. 
It seeps and soaks the floors, right through cardboard boxes. 
It’s a health issue, a safety issue and it’s just plain disgusting. 
When the grease trap overflows the place might have to shut down until the plumber can be called to suck the whole mess into a giant vacuum that connected to a big truck with a tank in the back. 
A tank holding all those things that went down the drain and caused a problem. 
This is exactly what happened around lunch at the Berger Haus where Oskar was dropping frozen French fries into old black oil.
Around his feet this puddle began forming. 
A smell like decay and death and the motor oil found in a fermented junk yard somewhere in the bowels of the Midwest. 
“Aw shit! Fuckin’ shit. 
Not again. 
Puta madre!” Oskar lifts his feet up. 
He’s tip toeing around the sewage spewing up from the ground. 
Like the bog exacting its revenge.
“Would someone please call the fucking plumber? Dakota!” Oskar has moved out of the way. 
Javier turns to watch. 
He leans on the dish washer and spits in the sink. 
Folds his arms across his chest and watches Oskar avoid the grease. 
Camron is all ready for this situation.
“Goddamnit Oskar! What the hell did you do this time? Have you been forgetting to close the drains in the fryers again? Did you spill a shit ton last time you changed the oil?”
“Fuck man, no. 
It just won’t fucking stop!” Oskar is standing by the freezer door, watching his station slowly flood with black brown swamp grease. 
“Oh god, this shit is fucking disgusting.”
Oskar does what comes naturally and goes out the back door. 
He rolls a cigarette and looks up. 
Dakota is already on the phone to the plumber. 
She says it’ll be an hour at least before he has time to stop by. 
This is not looking good for Oskar.
“Are you done smoking yet, you filthy fuck? Get some goddamn towels and old linens and get them on the floor. 
We don’t have time to cry about this. 
I need four orders of fries. 
And I need them right fucking now.” Camron flips a few burgers around on the grill. 
He slides the partially frozen beef patties around on the flat top and takes a few buns and lays them cut side down on a dry spot. 
He toasts the buns and slides the burgers on top. 
He puts the whole thing in a little paper tray and throws it in the window so that the box slides down to Dakota. 
Oskar sweats and kicks around a pile of greasy rags, old moldy aprons making a nest on the floor around the fryers.
This is going to be a long, stupid day.
Quitting time came exactly five years, seven months, two weeks, four days and seven hours later. 
Before that day at work was over two presidents were elected, Oskar’s childhood friends were all married and had multiple children, and his mother grew older and crazier. 
The environment got hotter and cancer was cured. 
Oskar was not happy about the cure for cancer. 
Oskar was still pissed off about the grease trap. 
He walked home under the street lights. 
He kicked at the shit in the street and swore out loud when no one was around to hear him. 
At least he thought as much.
On a bus bench near the corner store under a particular shade of street light was a mighty black man. 
His pigment was as dark as sin and stronger than a real cup of coffee. 
His hat might have been older than he was. 
He had fingers thick like slabs of bacon in a time when the pigs ate well and the pigs were fat and happy. 
His clothes were faded like the ending of a sad movie. 
He had a guitar case sitting next to him. 
The hard kind. 
The kind where it was hard to tell if that was leather or alligator skin. 
The old black man he says, “’ey Boy. 
Look he’re. 
Look he’re.”
And Oskar was dumb enough to stop and listen.
“Boy you look like a woman got to you.” And that old black man he laughs. 
He laughs like Thanksgiving and Christmas were having a party to celebrate St. 
Patrick’s birthday. 
He laughs until next summer then starts on again.
“Now lemme tell ya somethin’. 
Real quick like. 
Lemme lay a little story on you. 
Say Boy, you got a quarter?” And the black man shuts up and looks at Oskar for a second. 
“Stories gonna costa quarter from ya.”
And Oskar reaches into his pocket and finds a quarter. 
It must be his lucky fucking day. 
He hands the quarter over.
Black man goes, “lemme buy a cigarette off you for a quarter.” 
This gets Oskar to smile a bit. 
That was almost witty. 
He kinda liked the guy at the moment. 
Oskar takes out his pouch of tobacco and rolls a cigarette for the man with the guitar at the bus stop. 
The black man says, “Thanks Boy. 
That’s some mighty shitty tobacco you got there.” This time he only laughs until solstice. 
“Now about that story…
Now back in the day there was all kinds of nutty folk out there. 
Not nutty like you and I, Boy. 
Nutty like the way cookies can be or what’s that shit that hippies eat? Granola. 
That’s the shit. 
Shit is horrible. 
Anyway, so there’s this dude and his chick and they get all married and have a kid and the kid is alright for a time. 
Then the dude gets disinterested in his wife, fools around with her friends and gets one of them all with a kid too. 
Now the dude has two sons by two different women. 
Takes one under his wing and just sort of leaves the ma and the boy to fend for themselves. 
Which ain’t so bad. 
They do aight. 
‘Cept the thing is, dude’s kinduva big shot. 
Has a buncha land n’ shit. 
Now he’s got two sons and they’re entitled to the land and what not when he dies. 
He’s already a pretty old dude right? So his favored son, the one he kept gets it in his head to go out to sea. 
See the world, right? Wouldn’t you know it but the son got pushed overboard. 
Never heard from again. 
Declared dead. 
Dude goes all into a depression, affects his health. 
He’s all messed up. 
Doesn’t know where his sons are. 
Old and dying and got no more kids to take over the family business. 
So being the big shot that he is, he holds some try outs. 
Figures he can recruit just as well as procreate. 
Figures the rightful heir will turn up sometime and claim his shit. 
But here’s the twist. 
The bastard son’s ma dies of some disease. 
Kid never knows his dad’s loaded. 
Never knows he’s supposed to inherit the good life. 
Ends up living with his uncle on his ma’s side of the family. 
And this uncle guy, he’s a real piece of work. 
Makes the boy do all sorts of nasty chores. 
Cleaning up horse shit, caring for the animals on the farm. 
Slave work.
You hear me Boy? Slave work! Hey! Look he’re!
So the uncle being the opportunist that he is thinks he’ll go for this tryout thing. 
Thinks maybe this is his lucky break. 
Takes the kid along to be his lil’ servant. 
Clean up his horse shit. 
That kind of thing. 
So this tryout business is like a fight, right? Buncha guys all riled up. 
Battling for the fortune. 
And well shit. 
I must be boring the hell out of you. 
Boy you look lost.
And Oskar breaks his trance and looks at the black man on the bus stop with his guitar case and he’s no longer smoking that rolled cigarette. 
Just looking at Oskar.
“An ol’ nigga like me can go on f’hours. 
I’ll finish the story next time you come round. 
And next time you come ‘round, maybe you bring me a little something to sip on. 
Brandy is nice. 
Little brandy goes a long way.” And the old black man laughs from Halloween until Valentine’s Day.
“Run along, Boy. 
And don’t let them women getcha down like that. 
There’s plenty of time for that when you’re my age.”  
Chapter Six: The Prologue.
Earthquakes. 
Fire. 
Famine. 
Plagues, they call ‘em. 
Then there’s flooding. 
Then there are weird sicknesses. 
Influenzas or something. 
Yeah, I like that word. 
Influenza. 
It just sounds so sexy when you say it. 
Could be the name of some hot chick. 
Could be the name of a sexy dance. 
So here’s the setting. 
We’re at this farm, somewhere in the middle of fuck, USA. 
And there’s some old farmer dude and his livestock. 
There’s a bunch of immigrant workers in the fields, picking, weeding, harvesting, and dealing with whatever it is that he’s growing in there.
Farmer dude’s all like, “yep” and “mhmm” all the time. 
Spends a lot of time in the sun, has rough wrinkled leather skin like a lizard in a good farmers hat and blue jeans. 
The farmer dude is a stocky dude. 
He likes to watch his cows out there in the fields. 
He doesn’t like to watch the laborers. 
Not so much. 
He watched the cows chew grass and lay around. 
He watched them swat at flies with their tails. 
The cows are walking around all slow like. 
Their balls are swinging underneath them like twin grandfather clocks made from skin. 
Inside the balls of these cows something strange began to happen. 
Maybe it was dietary. 
Maybe it was something in the water. 
Maybe god came down from heaven on a little red wagon and kicked a cow in the balls before flying off to deliver presents to little children all over the world. 
Things you should know about me and cow balls:
I firmly believe that bull testicles are fucking delicious. 
The texture is like scallops. 
Big beefy fucking scallops. 
Seared or grilled, well marinated or straight up oil salt and pepper. 
I have dreams about cow balls. 
Sometimes they keep me up at night. 
Little nuggets of magic. 
I think everyone should eat balls whenever the opportunity presents its self.
Sometimes I start talking about balls I lose track of whatever else I was going on about. 
I would apologize, but I wouldn’t mean it anyway.
Also it should be noted that the balls of these particular cows were chalk full of fungus. 
Now, I’m not talking about the good kind of fungus. 
The kind that feed you or fuck you up or make everything better again. 
This kind of fungus was the kind that had some kind of relationship the cow balls. 
A bad relationship. 
A destructive and violent relationship. 
The cow balls needed counseling. 
Think of me as a testicular counselor. 
A hope for the future. 
A future full of balls.
The old farmer dude looks at the cows and scratches his own balls. 
The future is full of balls.
Chapter Seven:  It takes two to tango but only one to Cha Cha
See a blaze of purple hair in the wind on a neck on a backbone on a bike plowing the hillsides like a streamlined bead of sweat rolling down the face of America. 
Right after America’s morning jog around the world. 
See a girl with a bag at her side, snug on her torso, strapped in for the ride. 
See Cha Cha O’Henry fly over concrete seams and sidewalk cracks. 
Watch as she bobs and weaves through traffic like a paper boat in the run-off from a recent rain. 
Deliveries done, work over, off the clock and time to sit back, set back, and unwind the wind from her short, cropped, purple like a head of cabbage hair. 
She pulls up her bicycle to the side of a bar. 
Her apartment is right upstairs. 
Apartment number two. 
Right above the bar. 
Now the bar should have a few words. 
Just a few to sort of sum up what and who the bar is and why it’s there. 
The significance of the bar. 
Which really, isn’t all that significant at all. 
In fact, the bar will have no say in this. 
The bar was a dive joint with a lot of wood on the inside and concrete on the outside. 
That is to say, a rough, weather worn exterior, a warm cozy, messy like its well lived in interior. 
You might like this bar, you might hate this bar. 
But the bar will neither acknowledge your feelings nor give a rat’s ass about them. 
The bar will continue getting people drunk and kicking them out. 
The bar will continue being loud. 
Glass will keep breaking inside. 
The sound of pool balls hitting pool balls, the sound of loud people talking in a slurry. 
An erratic soundtrack of whatever the fuck. 
It wasn’t a bad bar, it wasn’t a good bar. 
Cha Cha locks her bike up outside.
She walks up the steps and unlocks the door and throws her bag down and sits on the couch. 
She sits down and works her shoes using one foot against the other. 
She lies down. 
She breathes. 
She closes her eyes. 
Her day now done for obligations and work and whatnot. 
She’s thinking about a nap and a shower and a drink sometime soon. 
She’s thinking about it. 
And for right now, that’ll do.
Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry’s Apartment.
When she got the place the rent was cheap and she liked the bar enough and everything just kind of fell into place. 
The inside is decorated with stolen signs, artifacts, remnants of her life. 
Cha Cha likes order and disorder in equal parts. 
Half the time, everything is clean. 
The other half of the time, it’s not. 
Her furniture consists of a small table, a two seated couch (some folks call those love seats. 
I guess two seats is an intimate insinuation. 
In this case it was practical. 
It was a small apartment. 
Maybe I should have mentioned that earlier. 
So go back a few steps and pretend you’ve never seen the place.) Alright, now we open the door to apartment two and it’s a very small apartment. 
There’s an array of paintings, posters, photographs, flyers, and odd things on the walls. 
There’s a small circle of shag rug, right in the middle of the room. 
She has a small radio on a small windowsill next to a little potted plant. 
She has a miniature chair with a tiny desk. 
All of this is ok. 
Cha Cha O’Henry is a pretty small girl. 
She fits right in there. 
That’s all you should know about her apartment.
Cha Cha took a whole paragraph of time to take a nice hot shower. 
She’s toweled off and clothed. 
Her beet juice hair is all wet still and drops drip, darkening and dampening her clothes as she walks around the place looking for her comfy shoes. 
In case you were wondering, she’s more a t-shirt and jeans kinda girl. 
That’s like, pretty standard you know. 
“I know right!” voices from down below seep into the hardwood floor and up they go into Cha Cha’s ear drums. 
“He’s like sooo into you!” Patio seating out back. 
It just drifts right in with the smoke and the lights. 
The thumping of a bass on the weekends. 
You get used to it. 
Cha Cha goes down the stairs and into the bar. 
She found her comfy shoes. 
Now she could use a drink. 
A nice shiny drink, all to herself. 
She’s thinking a cold, cheap beer and a shot of whiskey. 
That sounds like magic right there. 
Something special. 
A very special thing.
She sits down at the bar and behind the bar is a woman in her early thirties. 
She’s built like she belongs on the hood of a car magazine. 
She’s built like an S, like the first letter in she, sexy, saucy, and satisfaction. 
Like the first letter in silence, in solace, in soft and supple. 
She stands all arms akimbo, smiles at Cha Cha and says something so simple. 
She says,
“Well?”
And Cha Cha says,
“I need a special. 
Please.”
And the woman behind the bar pours the shot and cracks open a cold can of beer. 
She sets it down on the bar and Cha Cha hands her a five dollar bill. 
Cha Cha puts two dollars in tip on top of the bar and drinks the shot. 
 No hesitation, no waiting. 
Just downs it and takes a drink off the beer can. 
Cha Cha goes,
Aaaahhhhh
She does it like a leaf free falling from the top of a tree when the autumn winds start blowing and the leaf is all like, my job is done here! And he flies off into the street on to sidewalk and into a drainage ditch and down the drain and into the ocean. 
Cha Cha sighs like nature on a pension plan. 
Like the whole ocean hitting fifty-five and finally retiring. 
Cha Cha sighs a sing-song senior citizen’s discount with a shopping cart full of groceries.
Down the stools, across the long wood bar are two guys watching the baseball game, muted on a corner television. 
The guys are somewhere between twenty or thirty. 
Could be anywhere. 
Old enough to drink beer and watch baseball. 
The game goes on and takes days for anyone to make a move. 
A nice slow ball game for some slow beer drinking guys. 
The kind of thing most people like at the end of a long day.
There’s this painting on the wall. 
It’s a nice painting. 
A little stream and some trees. 
It’s all peaceful like. 
It’s the most peaceful looking thing in a two mile radius. 
There’s this tray of drink condiments on the bar top. 
A little tray with maraschino cherries and wedges of citrus fruits. 
There’s a small pile of olives in a little olive dish. 
Cha Cha pops an olive in her mouth. 
She chews it nice and slow.
“CATFISH!” A voice calls out. 
The voice is huge. 
The voice behind the catfish would take up three city blocks and carry them across town. 
The voice could stop traffic, stop motion, stop everything. 
That voice could stare the hole in the O Zone down and say, “HEY! CUT THAT SHIT OUT!” and the O Zone would be like, “oh man, I’m sorry man. 
I didn’t mean it.” 
A man only slightly smaller than his voice walks. 
He’s wearing an apron and a very utilitarian hat. 
He wears the hat because he’s bald. 
Without that hat, his head would be very cold.
The woman behind the bar says,
“Hey Nat, what’s cookin’?”
And Nat says,
“CATFISH!” He walks behind the bar and grabs a tall can of beer. 
He cracks the beer and in once swift motion, downs at least half of it. 
He walks out back to his grill and once more with feeling he says,
“CAAATFISH!” After he leaves there’s enough room in the bar for three competing marching bands, a parade and a kettle of fish.
Cha Cha eats another olive. 
She turns towards the television but doesn’t pay too much attention to it. 
Like a reflex. 
Like a moth to the front porch light at an apartment on the wrong side of town.
In an apartment on the wrong side of town, in a bed in a room there’s Oskar. 
Tired, beaten Oskar. 
He rolls over on his back and stares at the ceiling. 
He looks at the ceiling the way a woman once stared at a piece of toast until the Mother of god came down and rubbed her burnt face right on it. 
And just like I would have done were I that woman with the piece of toast, Oskar decided right then and there that he needed a drink. 
A nice strong, shiny drink. 
All to himself.
Right at very moment, Cha Cha flags down the woman behind the bar and says,
“Could I get another special, when you have time? Please.” She asks very nicely.
Chapter Eight: in which I’m not yet convinced I have ignored the plot enough yet.
Balls. 
Big ol’ swingin’ cow balls. 
All those bulls. 
Out standing in the field. 
If you had some kind of crazy telescope/microscope x-ray machine you could zoom right in on those balls. 
You could check out the nonsense under the hood. 
See what’s going on down there.
Things you will not find in and slash or on a field full of cow balls:
A circus.
The Warsaw Philharmonic.
A gunslinger challenging the sheriff to a duel.
A chess board with all the pieces.
A hot cup of coffee.
A paperback copy of the Constitution of the United States.
You will find all kinds of shit though. 
There will be shit on the balls, shit in the balls. 
Shit around the balls. 
Shit will circumnavigate the cow and the cow’s balls as long as there are cows and balls and shit to be around. 
The external shit isn’t the problem right now. 
Right now, the shit inside is causing a maddening itch. 
If there’s one great thing that I am glad about not being a cow, it would have to be the ability to scratch my balls with an appendage well suited for the task. 
A cow’s hoof won’t scratch balls with any sort of efficiency. 
More so, a hoof would just kind of slap at the sack of cow balls swinging liberally between the cow legs like a lindy hopper that’s been spun out on sugar and steroids during the entirety of spring training. 
Now, I don’t know about you, but if a hoof slapped my balls, I could only be very unhappy about it. 
I would be hurt and sad and angry then I’d feel sick and throw up all over the place. 
It would be a nobody wins kind of situation.
Inside the testicles of these bovine some silly virus is trying to divide by zero. 
The cows will start getting upset. 
First only a little, then very much so. 
Those fucking cows will lose their goddamned minds. 
Try an experiment to better understand the cow mentality. 
Go find a nice field of grass and stand around it all day wearing nothing but boxing gloves loaded with weights on your hands and feet. 
Roll your balls around in the field, get them good and acclimated. 
Now wait until the itching starts. 
And just try. 
Just try and deal with it. 
See how many times you smack yourself in the junk and the itching won’t stop. 
Count if you can, on a scale of one to ten, how nuts that starts to drive you. 
 Now picture yourself a few tons heavier. 
A couple hundred pounds of ungraceful muscle and fat. 
Try to dance your way out of that one.
I bet you thought you were pretty clever. 
I bet you though you could scratch your own balls.
Chapter Nine:  Brown Eyed Women and Red Grenadine.
The shift is over. 
The night is being swept into the dust pan called closing time. 
The strobe lights are off. 
The spot lights are down. 
The floor lights are up and at the bar is a row of photogenic, picture perfect, could be perfect porn stars. 
They sit in miniskirts that are more like belts. 
They sit in shorts and panties and blue jeans and sweat pants and hot pants. 
Like ducks in a row. 
Most of them are drinking vodka, some are drinking water. 
A few are drinking whiskey. 
They’ve broken off into little pockets of conversation. 
Like,
“Where did you get those boots?”
“I love your hair! It’s so pretty.”
You’d probably think they all like each other very much. 
You might think that every night is like girls night out. 
You are blind between the lines. 
You are all kinds of wrong about it. 
The air is competitive. 
This is a pretty ruthless game they play here. 
Take lacrosse and add a few more balls in there. 
Take out the sticks and put in poles, remove the ref and throw in a bouncer. 
Replace the scoreboard with a money box.
Above the bar where they all sit and talk amongst themselves is a neon pink flamingo of a sign spelling out in sexy cursive script, “The Daisy Chain”. 
It’s a nice sign. 
The sign will make you think of Florida. 
You’ll find the connection odd and completely expected. 
It’ll just feel right. 
Back down at the bar there’s a show going on. 
It’s a show of subtlety and insult. 
The girls with the bigger tits will do terrible things so that no one forgets about the fat sacks stapled to her chest. 
Little arm motions to set the skin to movement. 
A brush off of the hair in the face leading to a well racked display of what happens to Jell-O molds at housewarming parties during earthquakes.
The words will be nice, but no one’s really listening. 
The rivalries and disputes will carry on underneath all those letters. 
Each girl is there for one reason. 
And that’s a reason called rent. 
There are a lot of strippers in the world and each one is fighting off the rest of ‘em for a couple of bucks for five minutes of your time and the all too brief occupation of your lap. 
“Hey what was with that one guy?” A girl drinking something girly asks between straws.
“I don’t know but he creeped me out.” Another girl that’s already in civilian attire answers.
“He was hella weird.” This time it’s the bartender. 
The one whose tits have been gasping for air all night.
“He sent Takira out of here in a state.” Says another girl.
“Mhmm.” Replies someone else.
There’s this bouncer dude in a smart suit standing around all over the place. 
He’s in one place as much as any other. 
He’s like your average ex-military tuff guy. 
All cast iron barrel chest from the belt to the face. 
All work horse legs and thunder clap thighs from the belt down. 
And yeah, those are probably steel tipped black boots custom made to stomp any motherfucker that tries any funny business in a place like this. 
Leave the funny business to the comedians. 
The comedy club is down the street.
Down the street and a few over behind the wheel of an off green hatchback is that girl named Takira Sunrise. 
The bad news is there’s a guy named Franco and he’s got her number. 
The good news is that exactly eleven minutes ago, Takira picked up smoking again after a five year hiatus. 
She’s already smoked three down to the filter. 
She just parked the car and thought and smoked and thought some more. 
Smoking is the best way to get some thinking done. 
Almost as good as a hot shower. 
If there was a way to smoke cigarettes in a hot shower while getting the full effect of both, we’d all be prunes by now.
She looks at the photograph again and again and again. 
She looks at her boy there in the picture, oblivious, child like. 
And to think she was so happy that he never had a chance to meet his father. 
She was so happy to leave that behind and get the hell out while the getting was good. 
The umbilical cord of the past was just dragging behind her. 
Waiting to spring back like a neglected Slinky caught on the stairs of a great escape.
She flicks a fourth butt onto the sidewalk. 
She takes out the list of names and looks it up and down. 
Ten names ain’t that bad. 
This could have been much worse than a list of ten names. 
Could have been that Franco sent the cleaners right over to the club and they would have walked out with a linen bag full of Takira. 
That would have been real bad. 
And Takira’s thinking, “thank god I left that boy with Aunt Veronica.” Best decision she ever made. 
One barren womb aunt made day care specialist. 
Everybody wins.
She’d love to drive over and see him right now. 
She’d really love to. 
But her instincts tell her she’s probably got a tail. 
She’d put money on the idea that as soon as she pulled out of here another car would follow. 
She’s getting a dumb idea right now. 
She’s thinking that maybe just parking the car and getting on a bus and taking a train and switching to another train and then maybe a bus then a cab and the tail might be gone by then. 
Then she thinks a smart thought to counter act the dumb one. 
She’s thinking that there’s probably some guy camped out by her apartment. 
There’s probably some guy watching Aunt Veronica’s place too. 
Hell, when you get a message like that, the only reasonable reaction is complete and total paranoia. 
Everything is now on the road to shit. 
Everything is going to be just fucking terrible. 
A way out would be so cool right now. 
A brilliant plan would really make her day. 
Franco up and dying right now would convert her to every religion that ever was. 
At least until she got over it. 
At least until everything went back to normal. 
And as Takira thinks all these things she’s smoked like eight cigarettes and is lighting a ninth. 
Her throat is right pissed off. 
Her throat is the least of her concerns. 
She looks at the list again and wondering,
“Where I have seen that name before?”
She’s looking at the third entry on the list. 
The one that says, “Anita Fairbanks.”
Chapter Ten: Franco.
Set sail for Stereotypes. 
I want you to think about a villa. 
A nice Spanish style one with the red tile roof and the quaint little fountain and lots of gardening happening everywhere. 
Like the gardener gets paid to find unused soil and do something about it. 
Just like a bunch of fucking leaves and flowers everywhere. 
It’s not like Franco especially enjoyed flowers. 
It was his wife’s wishes that were planted in that garden. 
And his wife just adored the color green. 
She loved green the way most people love hot chocolate in December. 
 She loved green as if green pumped her quaint little heart into flowing what once was blood around in her veins. 
Green was in her eyes and she made damn sure that everywhere on the property she went or would go or considered going would match her green like stagnant spring water eyes. 
Franco was a man. 
He was one of those kinds of men that had one real wife and several other that thought they would be Mrs. 
Franco someday when he finally did away with the one he married. 
That just wasn’t going to happen. 
Mrs. 
Franco’s first name was Mindy. 
Mindy is the kind of name you give to a little girl that’s going to grow up and drop bombs on the world. 
She’s going to drop bombs from up in her tower far above the clouds. 
She’s going to remake the world in her image. 
Her image was one of those you’ve seen on magazines in the supermarket. 
The kind of magazines they put next to the checkout lines with all those pretty faces on them. 
Cover girls. 
That’s what they call ‘em.
There was a time that Franco could keep up. 
A time when he wasn’t an overweight house husband with a few business meetings a day. 
There was a time when business was booming and everything was going Franco’s way. 
But that was like, ten years ago at least. 
Now here he is. 
All fat and always worried about something. 
He still smokes cigars like a big shot. 
He still walks around the garden getting lost in the sea of green. 
Sometimes he feels like he’s back in Honduras, watching his father take the goats out to slaughter. 
He’s a little boy standing with his brothers and sisters and cousins and cousins and cousins. 
And they’re all watching Abuelo Franco run a knife around the neck of a goat. 
He’s holding the kid around the torso. 
He’s sure to severe the artery that’ll drain the blood and get that goat ready for a big family meal.
Franco takes a deep breath and takes in a lung full of sea air. 
A cool inhale. 
A nice break from the cigars. 
Franco has a thing for pleated khaki pants and deck shoes. 
He’d rather be on his boat right now. 
Mindy hates sailing. 
The last thing Mindy would ever do is sail away. 
Not even from shore to shore. 
Especially not to the virgin seas. 
That whole virgin seas thing is bullshit anyway. 
You know sailors and their reputation. 
Well, sailors have been at the seas as long as things could float. 
The seas are defiled and filled with seamen.
Franco stands in his garden letting the breeze blow on his chest hair between the buttons on his shirt, between the gaps in his slicked down comb-over. 
 Mindy is standing on a balcony that comes out of the second story. 
She’s standing there watching her husband putter around the garden like a little lost lamb that’s forgotten his way. 
She shakes her head and in a voice that could strip the habit off a nun she yells,
“MARTA!” and the sound of very small feet walking at a polite racing speed come pattering down the hall.
“Si?” Marta asks.
“Would you kindly tell Franco that dinner will be ready soon. 
Also tell him I’m going to open that bottle of cab he’s been saving.”
“Si Maestra.” And the feet scurry away down the hall, down the stairs, down more stairs and down into the garden and up to Franco who says,
“That’s nice.”
Dinner at Franco’s place is not the most pleasant experience for a fly on the wall. 
You’d be made uncomfortable a few times over. 
You’d see the way Franco just sort of knocks his veggies around with a fork and stares at his plate. 
You’d see how Mindy drinks a bottle of wine to herself before dinner is over. 
You’d see Marta cleaning up broken glass and broken china all the while saying nothing but, “Si.”
Mira. 
Mira aqui. 
Mindy is out on the patio, smoking long thin American cigarettes. 
Smoking them between wrinkled fingers with glossy nails. 
Smoking them one at a time and watching the early evening sun sink into the waves of another balmy day. 
Mindy is tired in a bad way. 
She’s tired the way a general is when he comes out of retirement to do one more battle. 
One more time. 
Once more with feeling.
Chapter Twelve: Meet me in St. 
Louise’s trailer.
Let’s go back like ten years. 
I know we’ve been jumping around all over the place and nothing’s really happening yet. 
But hold on, just sit tight. 
Let’s go back twenty years ago.
Barbara Waxbusch is wrapping up a concert in a punk club. 
Her hair is gelled and moused and pulled and teased in an array of waxy crayon colors. 
Her band mates are all black leather and ripped jeans. 
Spiked this and spiked that. 
Chains and stains and everything has holes in it. 
If you asked them, they’d say the holes were from fights they got into a few years back at some other club at some other time and this little bastard spilled his beer or someone’s beer and justice had to be served. 
Right now they’re in the back alley behind the club, passing around a bottle of gut rot. 
“Good show, man”
“Fuckin’ A, good show. 
That drum solo was fucking crazy.”
“Man, did you see that guy throw up all over that one chick, the one in the red?”
“Right in the front fucking row!”
“Damn, we’re so cool.”
And Barbara is leaning against the dumpster smoking a menthol cigarette. 
Barbara’s all like, meh. 
She looks cooler than she actually is. 
And she knows it. 
The band is called Landing Strip Express and street drugs are always on the menu. 
And Barbara is all like:
“Man.”
And the band’s all like, “huh?”
And Barbara just sighs more and drags on her cigarette like it’s the last life left in the universe and she’s mad as all hell for no real reason. 
She storms off and throws her still burning butt at the street and slams the door to her trailer. 
When I say her trailer I really mean the outhouse in the back.
The band is all like,
“What the fuck.”
And Barbara is all crying herself to some semblance of sleep on a nasty ass shit can.
She’s hoping she’s not going to throw up in the morning again. 
Especially because she hasn’t been drinking for a week. 
Especially because she tested positive for a parasite known as pregnancy. 
It’s the kind of thing that can ruin a girls day.
Chapter The Next One From Here
I can’t really remember what’s happening with the story any more. 
I don’t really want to go back and read what has already been written. 
So I’m going to start somewhere and see where we go with it. 
This could take a while. 
Just hold on. 
Bear with me. 
Or bare with me. 
Either way.
So we’re in this bar. 
And there’s our girl Cha Cha sitting down drinking beers and shooting whiskies. 
In the door around that time in walks Oskar. 
Poor ol’ Oskar. 
He walks up to the bar and asks for bourbon and rocks. 
He asks for a lot of bourbon, please. 
A nice big glass of bourbon and rocks that he can sip on for a good long time. 
The bartender, the one shaped like an S, like the personification of the word seduction.
Chapter One
I awoke nowhere near Paris. 
A whoosh and a blur and lights and off they went to pick up Roscoe. 
The Chev and I were parked on the side of the road. 
The Chev was an old truck. 
Old but fairly reliable. 
The Chev and I were on our way back home. 
 We’d stopped off for a toke and to kill that half pint of JB. 
Jimmy, the Chev and I all curled up in the front seat together. 
A girl and her two best friends in one place at one time. 
A little whiskey baby in the womb of my truck. 
Then there were the sirens and the lights and defiantly not Paris. 
Paris is not so much a field of long dry grass. 
Paris is not so much long winding coastal roads. 
Paris is really archways and whores and rows and rows of streetlights. 
Paris is baguettes and espresso, berets and drunken artists painting absolute shit. 
Paris is a big ass tower that some people think it’s clever to jump off of. 
Paris is not so much anywhere near me.
Absolute shit was in my thoughts and out of my mouth all along the pursuit home. 
“Shit. 
Shit. 
Shit. 
Shit. 
Shit. 
That Motherfucker.” I slapped the steering wheel with an open palm repeatedly. 
 The empty bottle had to go. 
Out the window to lie in the grass. 
That’s a good spot for you. 
Just chill for a while. 
The closer you get to home the longer it takes to get there. 
When there are a couple of cops blazing a trail in front of you then it might take until tomorrow. 
 You just might pass by your street and take the next one over and try to see what’s going on at your house before you pull up the driveway like a chump. 
The Chev pulled up to a spot where I could see the cops parked in front of the house. 
There were no signs of struggle. 
No cries for help. 
The arrest was made quietly. 
I watched them take Roscoe into the sheriff’s car. 
He had one those click tight ribbons around his wrists. 
He looked pitiful. 
I think I could hear him moan, “aww man. 
Really?” Before they took him away. 
They exited the scene without the sound and lights, driving legally for the first time in two hours. 
 I crawled around a bush and through the eucalyptus trees. 
 The house was as empty as ever. 
They got Roscoe. 
But they did not take the reason Roscoe was arrested with them. 
They didn’t have that kind of time on their hands. 
Or the proper vehicle to transport all of it. 
I however. 
I however had the Chev. 
While the Chev and I could only take so much right now and later wouldn’t be a safe option. 
This had to be a now or never operation. 
 I walk through an unlocked door into my own home, knowing that I’m going to have to abandon the place for a while. 
I pack the essentials first. 
Clothes, toiletries, a whole duffel bag stuffed full of essentials. 
Phone charger and a few good books. 
One small hash pipe of great personal significance. 
 All the cash I had stashed around the house. 
All the cash I knew Roscoe stashed around the house. 
And finally, to Roscoe’s private reserve.
Every year in Amsterdam there’s an event called the Cannabis Cup. 
Every year marijuana growers from around the world come and meet for a few days to swap seeds and stories. 
To smoke bowls and joints and bong hits. 
And to submit an entry in the competition. 
Who grows the best weed in the world? Roscoe had heard of the cannabis cup when he was young. 
Very young. 
From a young age, Roscoe dreamed of winning the cannabis cup. 
He wanted to eventually, judge the Cannabis cup. 
Aspirations from day one of sixth grade. 
Grow the best weed in the world and achieve fame, respect, and lots and lots of money. 
Selling the seeds of a winning strand would net him an early retirement fund. 
While in retirement, he would grow more weed. 
That was Roscoe’s life plan. 
The big one. 
The response to all those questions of what do you want to be when you grow up? A fucking baller. 
That’s what Roscoe would have said. 
My boyfriend’s being hauled off to county and I’m at home finding all his seeds. 
All his cured bud and getting two more duffel bags to carry it. 
I take a small scale and a box of baggies. 
Never know. 
I’m going to have to skip town and work for a few days until I know what’s going on. 
Lord knows what I could be implicated in or what that dumbass is telling the cops. 
 Or why the hell he’s locked up now in the first place. 
All I know is that I could be in trouble too. 
Terrible things could be coming my way. 
I pack all the money and marijuana and a coat and hat and anything else I might need. 
There’s half a fifth of whiskey in the house. 
I might need that. 
It stays under my arm as I haul three huge bags packed full of the essentials back to the Chev. 
The bags take up most of the cab. 
I can deal with that. 
I decide it’s as good as a time as any to smoke a bowl. 
I’m going to call that women’s intuition.
It’s dawn near Davenport. 
The sea air is around here somewhere, but I’m just far enough inland that it teases with your senses. 
 You might be near the coast. 
You won’t be quite sure. 
But drive west enough and it will be there. 
The sleepy little town of Davenport. 
A beach and a road house and a taqueria. 
Railroad tracks and run down everything. 
There’s a post office, which I think justifies the whole idea of a town. 
You can meet your whole town at the P.O. 
if you go there long enough. 
Everyone is going to have to send a package at some point. 
Or buy some stamps. 
Or envelopes. 
You can meet everyone here. 
It just takes time. 
In a town like this that means people are going to talk and know who they’re talking about. 
When word of the arrest hits the post office, it will spread like chunky peanut butter on the sandwich bread of children all across America on the first day of school. 
The bars will catch wind later that night when the drinkers come out to play, mingling with the rest of the working class. 
By noon tomorrow it will be old news. 
Something that’s already happened in everyone’s mind. 
Roscoe will be referred to as that strange farmer boy that had to ship at least two packages a week. 
Most of them going to Europe. 
He will be remembered as that awkward young man with the long hair and dark sunglasses. 
 He will mostly be remembered as that guy that got arrested for growing large amounts of grass. 
He will most certainly be remembered for being a bit of a dumbass.
“That fucking idiot.” I said sparking a second bowl. 
“That fucking retard.”
How could anyone be quite so stupid? I know the growers industry is a pretty shady operation in the first place. 
Taking advantage of legal loop holes and local versus federal laws and what not. 
But still. 
Prosecution is pretty low. 
No one really cares enough to waste tax dollars on a weed grower right now. 
There are bigger fish to fry. 
At least in these parts. 
California is a hot bed for every kind of activity imaginable. 
 Growing a little pot isn’t going to send you away for life any more. 
So, now what? I now have a Chev full of borderline legal cargo. 
Not really that full. 
But full enough. 
My options are north to San Francisco, south to Santa Cruz or east, to the sunrise and the great beyond. 
I have options for a safe house either north or south. 
South to surf city. 
North to the sprawling metropolis. 
To sky scrapers and and subways and everything that ever was.
Down south is also my sister. 
Marjorie is definitely in Santa Cruz. 
She certainly has an apartment and a dog and a couch for her little sister. 
That sounds like the best place to regroup, recharge and figure it out from there. 
Besides, family should always be able to help you out. 
No matter how bad it looks. 
I call her, still parked and looking at my house through bloodshot eyes. 
She answers the phone with a croak in her voice.
“Dude. 
It’s before noon. 
It’s before noon on my day off. 
Why the fuck would you ever call me before noon on my day off? I thought we had established rules about this kind of thing.”
“Look, sis, dude. 
I’m sorry alright. 
But shit just went down. 
Shit just hit a fan of epic proportions. 
Shit is fucked up right now.”
“Ok, ok. 
Emergency situation. 
That’s cool. 
You can call me if it’s an emergency. 
Hold on.” A toilet flushes in the background, the sounds of a sink and soap and hands being washed. 
“Alright, ok. 
Let’s hear your little dilemma.”
“Roscoe just got arrested.”
“Roscoe? Your boyfriend? What the hell could he have possibly done to get arrested? He’s like, the most inactive guy I’ve ever met. 
He doesn’t have the willpower to get arrested. 
Is couch surfing illegal now?”
“No, Marjorie. 
 He was growing a lot of weed. 
 I mean. 
A lot. 
Of weed. 
He had the basement filled with plants. 
That’s why we got that house. 
Huge Basement. 
Big Plus.”
“That’s still illegal? I mean, even in Cali?”
“Yeah, still illegal in the United States. 
That means still illegal in Cali.”
“When did this happen? I mean its balls early in the morning. 
You must be parked somewhere as a witness.”
“Yeah, hiding out across the street. 
Or rather, in the neighbor’s driveway.”
“Shit, dude.”
“Yeah, I know. 
I got everything I need from the house. 
I’m ready to get lost for a minute.”
“Good girl. 
Now what’s the plan? Sell a bit from the private collection? Make bail?”
“I dunno something like that. 
Hey, alright listen. 
Would it be cool if I just crashed at your place for a few days, figured out something?”
“Oh fuck no.”
“Dude, sis, come on. 
I really need a place right now. 
I just woke up to this.”
“Yeah, well, so did I! Thanks for that.”
“Are you serious? After that time when you crashed dad’s car into mom’s car and I helped you make it look like someone else’s fault? After that one time when you totally blamed me for killing grandma, which I might add had nothing to do with either of us. 
She just died. 
 It was her time. 
 She was old and ready and just because we thought it would be funny…”
“Ok, ok, ok.”
“And that one time in Mexico!”
“For fuck’s sake Laurel! I get the point. 
I was just fucking with you anyways. 
Of course you can crash here for a while, that’s totally cool. 
Just don’t come over until noon. 
 I have to kick someone out first. 
And give him a long goodbye.”
“Awesome. 
 I can take my time. 
Is he anyone I know?”
“Probably.”
“Probably? That’s all you’re going to give me?”
“Yep. 
I’ll have some Pop Tarts waiting for you when you walk in the door.”
“You’re a crown jewel in our royal family. 
Love you Marjie.
“Love you too, sis. 
Later.”
Chapter two:
He wasn’t exactly sure how he got there. 
Well, the how not so much a mystery as the why he was there. 
They were holding him in a florescent room with hard plastic seating arrangements. 
 The other occupants of the room were two and a half bums. 
The half bum was only pretending to be as much. 
The other two were the genuine article. 
You could tell by the way their eyes were not anywhere near the room. 
Their eyes were in deep space or talking to god. 
Their eyes never rested. 
When you dream at night, your eyes twitch under the lids, moving from side to side between memory and creation. 
Their eyes moved just like that. 
Except the lids were open. 
Sometimes they talked in their sleep. 
Roscoe was huddled onto a chair, trying to sleep, trying to do anything except be there then. 
 The half bum looked him over and shook his head. 
“Look, kid, look.” The half bum shook a dirty hand at him to get his attention. 
“Hey kid, hey. 
 Hey man look at me!”
Roscoe looked up in between fear and avoidance. 
He didn’t want to acknowledge the half bum. 
That could prove disastrous. 
That would initiate conversation or worse. 
He didn’t want to listen. 
He just wanted to sit there and wait for the scene to change.
“Look, asshole, I mean kid. 
Listen. 
What the fuck are you doing here? You don’t belong here. 
This is my room. 
Who the fuck let you in here? And who has permission to let guests into my room? I sure don’t. 
I am locked up here. 
They won’t let me out until tomorrow. 
Do you know what it takes to get back in this room in fifteen minutes? Let me tell you.” The half bum pauses to cough up mucus and blood on to the cold concrete floor. 
“Let me tell you something about perseverance.”
Groaning and feeling the red strips on his wrists. 
The plastic ties were completely unnecessary. 
He didn’t struggle or fight or give any sign of desperate measures. 
 He was a push over. 
A limp wrist in the wind of authority. 
Just a rag on a flag pole waving around to the will of the breeze. 
 Roscoe went along quietly into the police car and down to the station. 
He didn’t say anything. 
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 
So silence sounded like the best option. 
That and he was still a bit stoned. 
He was always in between sedation in one form or another. 
The police doing little to jar him from the heavy load of the hashish currently running loops and twists in his blood stream. 
“Perseverance is key! Key! The man out there will try and get you down. 
He’ll try anything to crush your spirit. 
You and I have something he’ll never have. 
We have the intelligence to read between the long winded lines of the law. 
We can see things for what they are. 
That’s why I’m here. 
Why are you here? You never said anything to me this whole time.” The half bum scratches at his crotch with gusto.
“I don’t know man. 
I really don’t know. 
It’s early in the morning still.” Roscoe fidgets around, trying to get comfortable.
“Is it? Kid, this room exists outside of time. 
You better scrap your notions of where you might be going and plans you may have made. 
Because as long as you’re inside here. 
The outside will go on without you. 
And there’s not a damn thing you can do about it. 
No phone calls. 
No nothing. 
They got your wallet and any personal possessions with them out there. 
You don’t even have shoes. 
How do you expect to do anything without shoes?”
“I don’t expect to do anything, man. 
I don’t have expectations.”
“See, that’s your problem. 
Well, that’s one of your problems. 
 We can get into the other ones later. 
But first off, these expectations you don’t have. 
What’s wrong with you?  Why don’t you have expectations? Why don’t you have shoes?”
“When did this become about me? I’m just here for some reason. 
They won’t tell me. 
They just say things like, ‘Oh, I think you know’ and ‘you did this to yourself, cocksucker.’ What a bunch of assholes.”
“Well you are what you eat, as my dear old dad would have said. 
At least he would have said something like that if the epilepsy let him talk more. 
You strike me as something of a pussy. 
Do you eat a lot of pussy?”
“There was a time, I guess. 
I don’t know what you mean by a lot. 
 Are we talking variety or frequency?”
“It doesn’t really matter. 
The point is, the point being. 
Point is. 
Did you ever expect to eat some pussy?” The half bum shifts in his plastic chair, remembering the best tulip he ever smelled.
“Well, sure, there was a time when I considered it dessert. 
You know? Like you just had a nice meal and now you move on and between a pair of legs. 
Spreading your way to culinary glory, tongue deep in the sweetest piece of pie you could find.”
“Ok, ok. 
 I get it. 
You’re a pussy. 
You’re a pussy and you are what you eat. 
That’s fantastic. 
I’m very happy for you. 
I feel much better about you not raping me now.”
“What the hell? You were expecting me to rape you? Are we in prison? Is this really what prison is like? I was expecting more bars.”
“Oh no, we’re not in prison, this here is just holding. 
This is where they keep you until they know what to do with you. 
They’ll never know what to do with me. 
I keep surprising them. 
I’m smarter than them. 
That’s why I’ll be stuck in holding for a good long time. 
Maybe they’ll let me go again. 
But who knows? I certainly don’t. 
Not my job to know things. 
I’m just here.”
“Dude! You just said something about me not raping you and I guess that wasn’t really important. 
Do you exist solely as an extension of shock value? I mean, dude. 
Seriously.”
“Ha! Got you good that time didn’t I? Yeah, the ol’ rape line riles a few feathers now and then. 
Don’t let it get to you. 
I’m just rehearsing for the day they really get me. 
When I go to state or the fed. 
Then I’ll need every shred of wits at my disposal. 
You worry a lot. 
I mean you are a pussy and that’s something that pussies do. 
Worry about a bunch of shit they can’t fix or change or do a damn thing about. 
Just sit and worry. 
That’ll get you places. 
Doors will open at your shoeless worry worn feet. 
You make me sick. 
Just like eating pussy makes me want to puke.”
“Alright man, alright. 
I get it. 
Just shut the hell up and let me sit here, trying to nap or something.”
“Nah, I don’t think so. 
Time passes faster if we talk. 
Even if we just end up screaming at each other. 
It’s better than nothing.” The half bum flicks bits of dead skin out from between his fingers.
“How could screaming possibly be better than nothing? What kind of sense does that make?”
“Because there’s an exchange of attention! It’s not neglect, and nothing is worse than neglect. 
Neglect says ‘I just don’t care about you.’ Or it would, if neglect actually cared enough to acknowledge your existence. 
 Neglect will leave you cold and lonely and leave you there to die, not even pretending that you matter. 
But screaming at least means there’s an emotional investment. 
We only scream about things that really matter. 
It takes a lot to make most people scream. 
But a neglectful person would never bother to scream. 
That’s a lot of effort. 
And there are always better things to do than scream.”
“Of course there are better things to do than scream. 
Lots of better things. 
No one has to scream to make their point. 
That’s totally unnecessary.”
“Are you a neglectful pussy? Is that what your problem is? A neglectful pussy with no expectations?”
“Jesus, man. 
Why are you digging in to me like that? What did I ever do to you?”
“You barge into my room and expect me not to dig into you a bit? You’ve got some nerve. 
Of course I’m going to rip into you. 
All the other options have been exhausted. 
I’m not really interested in your life story. 
I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t believe mine or care enough, especially since my life story has absolutely nothing to do with you. 
So we could sit here and bore each other to death, or I can mock you and pray on your insecurities, much to my own amusement.”
“You know you’re an articulate motherfucker for being a bum.”
“Oh, I’m only half way there. 
The other half is on the way. 
But that’s later. 
Right now…”
The sound of a door opening interrupts everything in this room. 
The two and half bums are at a kind of attention and Roscoe is perked up and listening. 
A man in uniform looks at everyone in the room in disgust.
“Beecher. 
First name… illegible…”
The half bum giggles to himself and slaps Roscoe on the back.
“Well, my name’s Beecher. 
I don’t give a fuck who you think you are. 
Get out of my room.” And with that he leaves. 
He leaves and now all Roscoe has are two regular bums with amphetamine teeth and Listerine hangovers. 
 They don’t look at anything even slightly resembling Roscoe. 
One of them mumbles quietly. 
The other begins humming Oh, Canada. 
A Roscoe’s spine is an ice luge dripping sweat cold enough to shoot in a glass. 
The Canadians. 
The fucking Canadians.
Chapter Three:
Highway one runs along the coast like a prodigal son. 
Wayward and misguided. 
Giving hints of an ocean and the distant just over the cliff visions of waves breaking. 
This road doesn’t work as well at dawn as it does at dusk. 
With dusk you get the sunset on your right and the tree infested mountains on your left. 
With dusk you get a cool night breeze that will tickle your arm with salt water spray as you navigate the air currents with an open palm. 
With one wing extended you will dream of catching flight and soaring above the roads, piloting off pockets of thermal uprisings. 
 Just like a bird. 
Just like a bird in a beat up Chevy truck hugging the curves in all the right ways. 
Except it’s just after dawn and the sea on the right undulates like a sequined sheet hanging out to dry.
Laurel steers one handed, sipping from a paper cup of coffee whenever she can. 
She takes it easy, at least the driving. 
There’s no hurry. 
 She has a good three hours before she can see her sister. 
She’s not one to arrive without gifts to a family function. 
And Marjorie isn’t the easiest girl to shop for. 
She never wants or appreciates gifts. 
“Fucking clutter and useless crap.” That’s what she calls most gifts after the giver is out of earshot. 
She’ll find a way to get rid of most anything. 
What do you get the girl that appreciates little and holds on to next to nothing? Breakfast. 
That’s exactly what you get her. 
She will love you for feeding her. 
She’ll love you anyway. 
But now with a full belly everything will be that much easier.
The road takes the Chev down into the start of town. 
Effortlessly becoming Mission Street. 
Almost every good sized town in California has a mission street. 
In grade school history they will blame this on a Father Junipero Serra. 
He was a man that traveled up and down the coast converting heathens and building missions. 
More than likely using the native labor force. 
The great grandparents of the men that stand around the hardware stores and lumber yards looking for day labor jobs all week long. 
In towns just like Santa Cruz. 
All over California.
Laurel drives into town. 
Hardly anything is open. 
It is Sunday and it is before noon. 
Anyone with a shred of common sense would be asleep right now. 
Asleep or in church or maybe reading the paper over a cup of coffee. 
Or going to the gym. 
Maybe they would be jogging. 
Point is. 
Point being. 
It’s really early on a Sunday. 
And no one wants to be at work right now. 
Especially not the few people that are at work right now. 
And they all work in Restaurants, Gas Stations, and Coffee Shops. 
This group of people doesn’t know what a weekend is supposed to be. 
When all their friends are at parties on a Friday or Saturday, they are at home, going to sleep so they can get up at six or eight in the morning. 
And open up shop.
This is exactly the type of girl that made Laurel’s coffee this morning. 
And she will meet the same type of girl at the café where she stops to order two everything bagels with lox and cream cheese. 
 The girl behind the register will not smile. 
Not really. 
It might look like a smile. 
It might resemble something of a genuine smile. 
But it will be a distant relative of a smile, the one that’s always being mistaken for her cousin at parties.
The bagels safe on the passenger seat, Laurel still has an hour and a half to kill. 
What the hell is there to do at ten thirty on a Sunday? You could go to church. 
The idea strikes you as novel. 
Like a silly passing notion. 
You could go to the wharf and watch the beach at sunrise. 
Not so bad, but not as good as sunset. 
West Coast and everything. 
Sun does set in the west. 
Too bad. 
Maybe later. 
But right now you might as well drink some coffee and look at the ocean. 
The ocean will give you peace of mind. 
The vastness of the whole thing. 
It will give you some perspective. 
The giant blue mass. 
Always there and waving around. 
Going nowhere. 
 Going everywhere at once. 
That’s the ocean for you. 
Completely reliable. 
Driving out to west cliff seems like the most reasonable thing to do right now. 
The Chev pulls into the parking lot by the wharf. 
There are restrooms here with outside showers built in. 
They must be for washing off all that sand. 
 There’s a walkway that will take you right on to the beach. 
Or there’s a sidewalk that will take you to the wharf with another café and more restaurants, all of which are serving brunch right now. 
Champagne and eggs. 
Last night’s steak with last night’s potatoes and a glass of champagne with orange juice. 
They call that a mimosa. 
The cross breed of two of America’s favorite breakfast drinks.
Laurel feels the stiff salty breeze on her face. 
The chill of autumn winds coming off the ocean just after dawn. 
The salt water and several sea lions waking up, barking like a kennel full of strays that will never fetch baseballs again. 
Laurel looks down at the fat beasts. 
How they lie there, seemingly content. 
Bellies hanging off the wooden beams of the wharf. 
Fat, lazy bastards. 
Not a care in the world. 
 They pay her absolutely no attention. 
 She looks down at them, she looks down and she frowns slightly exhausted and perturbed.
“Why do you miserable fuck-stains get all the luck? You don’t have boyfriends running illegal operations in your house! You don’t even have laws! You just lay around, being fat and full of fish. 
What the fuck. 
Where’s my laying around time? When do I get to retire? You can’t be so old. 
You couldn’t have earned that kind of life. 
What did I ever do that was so bad, so bad as to be exiled from my own home?”
You’re not so much mad at them as they are just there to absorb your anger. 
They don’t care. 
They can’t even understand a word you’re saying. 
 You’re just a different kind of background noise. 
The sea lions want nothing to do with you unless you can provide food or entertainment. 
You are not a fish. 
You are not so interesting. 
The sea lions bark indiscriminately. 
You remain inconsequential. 
Laurel frowns at the sea lions. 
The sea lions just lie there. 
On the beams. 
Same place they will be tomorrow. 
And they still won’t give a fuck. 
If she had something heavy to throw, she might think about throwing it now. 
Knocking one of those great sea beasts upside the head. 
Nature wouldn’t care if she did. 
Nature lets the sharks kill the sea lions. 
Nature lets volcano’s erupt and spew lava into the ocean making islands and are destined to become the luxury resorts of the super rich. 
Nature doesn’t give a fuck what we do anymore. 
It’s all been done before. 
We’re just trying to stay alive. 
And so is nature. 
We do not have the upper hand in this situation. 
Mother Nature is not a housewife that will take a black eye sitting down. 
Mother Nature will burn your house down with you inside it. 
She will collect the insurance and settle down in a nice beach community with gates to keep out the ruffians and vagabonds. 
Mother Nature will move on and you will be fertilizing a bed of wild flowers. 
The rest of the wharf consists of a few seafood restaurants with poor to mediocre food. 
They will all be serving brunch right now. 
Brunch with an ocean view. 
How nice. 
We can sip mimosas and eat our eggs Benedict while the kids munch on French toast and drink their colas and other assorted soft drinks. 
We can talk about the future while the kids send text messages to their friends back home, telling them about how lame it is to be eating French toast with their family so early on a Sunday morning. 
They will stare at anything aside from the Pacific Ocean stretching out towards Japan and south East Asia. 
Going all directions at once because it is an ocean. 
Because it’s really all the same body of water. 
It’s just too damn big so we had to divide it into seven sections and give them all names. 
 Division and name calling. 
The ocean is grade school all over again. 
Just a math problem and a nickname you never wanted to hear. 
Walking down on the wooden walkway, Laurel passes the candy shop, the various tourist gift shops, all with over priced jewelry and hats. 
 Cheap sunglasses and swimwear. 
Because some people show up to the beach without sunglasses or a suit. 
Expecting not to need such things. 
Being proven terribly wrong and now forced to spend twice the retail value of some cloth that will allow them to be in a socially acceptable state while on the beach. 
Such is the scene in Surf City, USA.
There was an article in the paper a little while ago. 
Something about how Hamilton Beach was claiming the rights to Surf City, USA and Santa Cruz had pretty much established the use of that moniker for something like forty years. 
There were songs about it. 
Books. 
 Photographs lining most of the businesses that capitalized on the whole surfing thing. 
None of those had any effect on Laurel. 
All she could think about now was eating that bagel that was sitting in the Chev. 
All this wharf walking and sea lions and brunch nonsense made her terribly hungry.
Eating breakfast in a parking lot is an acquired art form. 
Not everyone can pull this feat off with grace and style. 
You need a certain kind of nonchalance. 
 You must possess at your disposal an attitude that states simultaneously, I am cooler than you. 
And yeah, I’m eating breakfast standing up, leaning on my old ass truck. 
Fuck you, my dad could beat up your dad. 
End of argument. 
 You should probably wear sunglasses when you do this. 
You might consider taking up smoking just to look cool in a parking lot after eating a bagel with your sunglasses on. 
 That’s something the Fonz would have done. 
That’s the kind of cool that will never die.
Laurel picks a piece of lox off the bagel and drops it into her mouth. 
She licks cream cheese off lips and pushes her sunglasses up the bridge of her nose using her little finger. 
All of this while resting against the Chev with one foot and the other firmly on the ground. 
She observes an early morning intersection, marked by a liquor store; a café with a restaurant attached, and railroad tracks cutting through. 
 Does anyone still jump trains? That sounds like great way to travel. 
Hitch a train right here and take it down to L.A. 
Or up north to San Francisco. 
Maybe there’s a train that goes east from here. 
Not here, here. 
But somewhere along the way. 
This track is mostly for a tourist train that runs through the redwoods. 
From Felton to Santa Cruz and back again. 
From the heart of the Valley to the Beach. 
The morning is still warm. 
 As soon as the sun comes up the temperature changes to remind you that it’s been an Indian summer. 
The afternoon will be mostly cloudless. 
It will still be shorts and tee shirts and sandals weather. 
 This is perfectly agreeable. 
The sunshine and Laurel get along like rain and root vegetables. 
She basks in the calm morning air, licking the last of the cream cheese and crumbs from her fingers. 
She still has an hour to deal with. 
She has an hour to mill around and be distracted by a sleepy beach town, recovering from wave after wave of foreigners on sightseeing trips. 
College students coming into town to scope out the place. 
Seeing if this town is all it’s cracked up to be. 
They will walk down Pacific Avenue in herds, led by a guide that will explain to them how cool this town is. 
 The influx of new students will determine the city budget, will affect the public transportation system, and will undoubtedly over crowd the handful of decent bars. 
 The new students will bring a barrage of baggage with them and they will litter the streets with their nonsense. 
Down Pacific Avenue is a good morning walk. 
It will be a sidewalk stroll with all kinds of smells and sights. 
From the beach to Pacific will be weeds and chain linked fence. 
It will be a road in need of repair. 
 The shops begin around the Chinese restaurant and the car stereo place, next door to the used car lot. 
Then there will be two dive bars in various degrees right next to each other. 
This is the best place in town to score hard drugs. 
At very least, it is the most convenient. 
You can pretty much be sure to get something along the lines of whatever you’re looking for. 
Quality is completely inconsistent. 
But this is a convenience store for contraband. 
This isn’t a farmer’s market or co-op. 
This is the Seven Eleven of discount crack cocaine. 
You can be sure it’s cut. 
You can be sure you’re going to get ripped off a few times. 
But hey, that’s business.
There’s a liquor store just after that. 
Just the right size for a corner store. 
There will always be one of three people working behind the register. 
This adds to the homey small town ambiance of the place. 
A familiar face behind the counter. 
A man that will know what kind of liquor you drink and what brand of cigarettes you smoke. 
A man that will know your face and your name but still check your I.D. 
every time. 
Smile. 
You’re on a security camera.
Because it’s a Sunday and there’s not so much to be doing, because Santa Cruz is a town that’s never in a hurry, you will be tempted to relax. 
To take it easy. 
Laurel takes a leisurely pace, hands in pockets of well worn blue jeans. 
Feet in socks and sneakers coated with different layers of dust and dirt. 
Torso in a shirt of muted color, faded from years of washing and being worked in. 
Her small frame well tanned from digging in the dirt, from harvesting in the late summer sun. 
Her arms will be toned with muscles from lifting crates of beets and bunches of radishes. 
 Having a farm job means never needing a gym membership.
Having a farm job means you learn how to grow some fantastic marijuana. 
Laurel looks around for a joint smoking area. 
 A safe haven from prying eyes. 
Not that’s she’s scared of the cops, not exactly. 
Not here. 
Her drug of choice is pretty low on the cities list of priorities. 
She’s more concerned with the mooches. 
They will smell the pungent, sweet aroma of burning Mary and follow her until she is found. 
She remembers a place not too far from here. 
Either down a cross street to the bleachers at the high school. 
In the opposite direction to the levy. 
Or down Pacific a ways until there’s a parking garage. 
Not much of anyone is on top of a parking garage early on a Sunday. 
Peace and quiet and a view. 
That sounds just about right.
Laurel walks to the right side of the road. 
She crosses the street and walks past the Mexican restaurant and the metro station. 
The city metro and a Greyhound station. 
Launch pad to out of town. 
Last hope for escape for the carless. 
The refugees sleep under the overhang, keeping safe from the sunshine and maintaining sleep in the shade. 
Crusty kids with army surplus matched luggage. 
 From who knows where. 
Going anywhere else. 
Getting nowhere fast. 
These are the kids that will catch wind of your smoky bowl and inquire about getting some. 
Just a hit. 
Please? Spot me a bowl? Anything? Business is business and right now this is Laurel’s only resource. 
 She’s going to have to safeguard her source of income. 
Don’t pinch too much from the till. 
Keep enough to get that dumbass out of wherever he ended up. 
Wait for him to call. 
He’ll get a phone call. 
They will let him call you so you know what the hell is going on. 
So you can claim responsibility for his mistakes and use whatever money you can muster to try and deal with things in court. 
This is going to be a shitty month. 
Laurel has already decided this. 
She is committed to this month being nothing less than a nonstop screaming match with Roscoe. 
This month will not so much be peaceful. 
She is ninety-eight percent certain of this.
The pleasant part of the Avenue comes into view with rows of trees lining the road. 
With restaurants and shops with fancy signs and budgets and foot traffic. 
The money starts right around here. 
Right after the street with the Tiki bar and the taqueria. 
Here you will find salons with hundred dollar haircuts. 
Jewelry stores that are always having a sale. 
ATMs, kiosks selling vegan food, a sushi place, a skate shop, a supermarket for hippies and random hangers on. 
Drifters and yuppies out for a morning bike ride. 
One or two walks of shame will pass you by. 
With faces expressing recently woken frames of reference, hangover complexions, all night parties that haven’t quite ended, bags under eyes, make up running down, eye lids struggling to deal with the brightness of it all. 
Laurel passes a book shop and coffee cart, intersections of little to no consequence. 
Places of business not even remotely her concern right now. 
If she can get the timing right, everything will all work out. 
A little dawn patrol on the parking lot roof. 
A sunrise session. 
Then a stony backtrack to the Chev and then to Marjie’s place for some quality sister time and a nap on the couch. 
It’s been a stressful morning. 
She could use some time to recharge. 
She could use a lot of things right now. 
Reassurance that her life did not just go to shit and out of control. 
That her dipshit boyfriend didn’t just ruin their retirement plans. 
Around a corner and through an archway into a hall between Pacific and Front street. 
 Up a few flights of stairs in a sparsely populated parking structure. 
 Walk up the incline, find a nice chunk of concrete to perch on that’s not covered with seagull shit and spark a bowl. 
Watch the few and far between traffic make way across the bridge to Ocean Street. 
See the people milling about in front of the drug store. 
Feel the sun on your skin and glaze over your eyes and sigh and breathe and listen to the chorale of a city waking up in four part harmony. 
If your boyfriend didn’t just get arrested, this could be the start to a perfect day.
The bowl is cached. 
It’s all ass and ashes. 
Laurel taps out on her palm, blowing the remains into a breeze. 
She sits a minute, taking the scene in around her. 
The green hills in the distance. 
The streets stretching off to the shore. 
She gets up and dusts off her backside. 
She reaches up with her arms into the sky and tilts her neck, popping joints with satisfying little cracks and snaps. 
She cracks her knuckles, her neck, her back, her shoulders, wrists and ankles. 
Laurel is ready to deal with today on her own terms.
Down the staircase and back to the street. 
Back on the sidewalk and hands in pockets and shuffle along back to the Chev with a now cold bagel soaking up cream cheese. 
A man that’s mostly tattoos and metal ears rides a bike in circles in front of a coffee shop. 
He’s waiting for someone, just like everyone else. 
 Laurel walks inside and orders two large cups of black coffee to go. 
This isn’t a cream and sugar kind of morning. 
This is going to be an uncut caffeinated kick start of a morning, followed by a day of figuring some things out. 
Followed by a whiskey night and a whiskey morning and we’ll see how long that’ll last.
Two old poets are playing chess in the black metal chairs out front. 
A shaggy boy with thick glasses carries a padded guitar case on his back. 
His eyes dart around not out of nervousness, but more so because he can’t hold them still. 
He talks to the tattoo on the bicycle in the opposite of a library voice. 
Laurel passes by without alarming anyone. 
She doesn’t think anyone’s noticed her coffee purchasing experience. 
She is free to go and not interact. 
Just the passing idea of a girl, walking with a purpose. 
Too busy to stay and chat with the locals. 
 The tattoo and the shag will have noticed and waited until she was a ways down the street before saying anything. 
They will speak of her briefly in fairly flattering words. 
Flattering for street slang and local dialect at least.
The rest of the walk back is punctuated only by several requests for spare change or a cigarette. 
She’s not even smoking. 
Why would someone ask her for a cigarette if she wasn’t smoking? Does she look like a smoker? Does she have that air of nicotine about her? She is stoned. 
Of that much, she is sure. 
But that’s a different breed of smoke. 
It’s not the same. 
She’s not like the tobacco people. 
 She doesn’t understand the allure. 
 It’s just not her thing.
The Chev is just where she left it. 
No tickets. 
No recognition. 
No signs of tampering. 
Everything is in order. 
 The other cup of coffee rests in the passenger seat next to the neglected bagel. 
Hot coffee and a cold bagel. 
At least it’s something. 
The drive to Marjorie’s apartment is short from here. 
Only a matter of a few blocks. 
 Laurel parks the Chev again and walks up another flight on concrete steps. 
She knocks on the door and waits, checking her watch. 
It’s twelve fifteen. 
Just about right. 
Just after noon. 
The door opens to Marjorie’s mess of dreadlocked hair, her closed lip grin and a pair of eyes that are all in the family. 
She has half a hand rolled cigarette hanging between two fingers and the neck of a morning beer bottle in between the other two.
Chapter four.
“You fucking pothead.”
“Morning sis! I brought you breakfast.”
“Aw Lars, you shouldn’t have. 
Actually, fuck that, I’m starving. 
And I was lying about the Pop Tarts. 
What’d you bring me?”
“Black coffee and a bagel.” Laurel tosses the bag on the coffee table and puts down her purse.
“Black coffee? That’ll only interrupt my beer. 
No thanks. 
But a bagel. 
A bagel is perfectly reasonable. 
Good job. 
At least half of your efforts were not in vain.”
“I tried. 
You are the most difficult woman in the world to please.”
“So not true. 
My needs are very simple. 
I’m not rocket science.”
“Good morning then?”
“Very. 
That boy had stamina.”
“Glad to hear it. 
As long as you’re in a good mood.”
“So far. 
So good. 
Let me get you a beer and you can watch me eat and tell me all about it.”
“I can deal with that. 
That sounds like a good plan. 
Yeah.” Laurel sinks into the couch. 
 “I think this might have something to do with Canada.” A perfectly medium dog with perfectly medium length hair ambles up to Laurel. 
He begins licking her hand and wagging a lot. 
He’s a good dog. 
She pets him absentmindedly.
“Like the whole country of Canada? Roscoe couldn’t manage something like that. 
There’s no way.”
“I don’t know how involved he is specifically. 
I think he might just be the guy that got caught.”
“Involved in what exactly? Selling weed across national borders? Trafficking is still serious stuff no matter where or what you’re busted for. 
What a retard.”
“I know. 
I know this is way over his head. 
But that’s the past and now is now and now he’s in jail or prison or something that is certainly not home.” Marjorie cracks a bottle open and hands it to her sister. 
She takes a long heavy gulp down. 
“I just don’t know what’s going on right now and I need to crash somewhere safe for a while.” The dog curls up to her on the couch. 
Demanding nothing and taking everything it can get.
“Because no one will ever come looking for you at your sister’s place down the street.”
“That’s what I’m hoping.”
“This isn’t the brightest idea you’ve ever had. 
You’re a potentially hot commodity right now. 
I’m guessing that truck of yours is stuffed full of that dipshit’s devil weed.”
“Not quite full…”
“Either way, even with a medical card you’re way over the limit.”
“Yeah. 
I’d say that’s one way to put it. 
I’m going to have to get rid of as much as I can, as fast as I can for as much money as possible. 
 Wanna help out with the footwork?”
“I might know a few people. 
But seriously, everyone just grows their own here. 
It’s too easy not too. 
And much more profitable.”
“Yeah, tell me about it.”
“Look, I’ll see what I can do to help, but I’m not making any promises. 
In the meantime, we should look for somewhere safer for you to stay until we know more. 
I’ve got some friends up north in Berkeley. 
I’m sure they’d be down to let a cute farm girl crash at their place. 
Especially if you come bearing gifts of green.”
“Do I know them? I hate to intrude on a couple of strangers. 
 I really don’t know about that.”
“Strangers to you maybe, but these guys are solid. 
And no one except me would ever look for you there. 
And unless I sent you, I’d never come look for you there. 
It’ll be perfect. 
I’ll call them later.”
“Later? Why not now? Shouldn’t we get a move on? It’s already after noon.”
Marjie shakes her head. 
“These two wouldn’t be caught doing anything until at least two in the afternoon. 
When I say laid back guys, I mean lazy as fuck. 
Don’t worry about it. 
The situation is pretty much under control.”
“I hope so.”
“Trust me. 
Trust your sister. 
I can work miracles. 
Right now, as far as you’re concerned, I’m saint fucking Jude. 
As far as I can see, this is an easily manageable situation. 
At least the part about keeping you safe for a few days. 
The rest I don’t know about. 
I kinda want the jackass to rot in jail for a while and think about what he’s done. 
Might do him some good. 
Maybe he won’t listen to Phish all the goddamn time after being in jail. 
Better for you, better for him.”
“Better for me… Better for him.” Laurel finishes her beer. 
“If you say so.”
“Besides, stay the night. 
You don’t visit enough. 
And we can hit the bars later. 
We haven’t been kicked out of a bar together in years. 
It’ll be great. 
Let’s have some fun, get your mind off things. 
Either that or you can stay her with Dutch and I’ll go tear things up O solo Mio.”
“Is that what your dog’s name is? I could never remember.”
“Short term memory loss, my dear. 
Happens to everyone someday.” Marjorie tries to take a gulp of beer and comes up empty. 
She eyes the bottle disapprovingly and walks to the fridge. 
“Anyway. 
Post up here. 
Get comfy, take a nap, take a shower. 
You probably need both. 
Mi casa su casa n’ shit.
Chapter Four.
The half bum was right about holding. 
No sense of time. 
The constant lighting makes time as meaningless as the space between a eunuch’s legs. 
The pale yellow light will give everything a sense of slow motion decay. 
Of watching the inner workings of entropy wasting away on the cold hard plastic. 
The cold hard concrete. 
And now all alone, Roscoe hasn’t slept. 
His eyes have been closed and he’s trying to keep warm. 
They took his jacket, his shoes, his wallet. 
 Anything distracting. 
Anything warm. 
He’s cold and losing his mind. 
 He’s miserable and just wanting something else. 
There’s something of a bathroom in here. 
A stainless steel can, mostly shat on, not in. 
Moisture all around it. 
Vomit on the floor. 
Piss on the vomit. 
Shit all over everything else. 
The sight and smell of the little room will only increase the urge to vomit on the shit.
Several eternities will pass before he hears his name called. 
He will die and come back out of the womb of wakening a few times before he hears “Maxwell, Roscoe Maxwell.”
“Oh thank god! Fucking finally!” Roscoe gets up and staggers into more fluorescent lighting. 
Bags under eyes, skin a hanging testament to decay. 
He’s not looking sharp or well. 
He looks like hell. 
The kind of hell that escapes from the outhouses on construction sites. 
 He’s not anywhere near his Sunday best. 
Roscoe is long unkempt hair, down to his shoulder blades. 
He is an old tie-died shirt and acid wash jeans. 
Roscoe is in no visible condition to contest his case before anyone. 
Damn near any judge or jury would pass judgment on him within five seconds. 
He just looks tailored for his crime. 
A stumbling cliché of nonviolent dope dealing. 
A hold over from several decades of leftover hippies. 
Roscoe is lead into an ill lit room.
“Sit down, sit down.” A plain clothes man tells him upon entering, motioning to one of three wood and metal chairs.
“Have a seat; we don’t have to be here long. 
But that’s entirely up to you.” Another cop in a hat and jacket informs him. 
“Thank god!” Roscoe exclaims.
“Tell us about the fucking Canadians!” the plain clothes shouts at him, banging a meaty fist on the table.
“Whoa, hey Pete, calm down. 
Let’s start this off nice and easy. 
We don’t want our boy to get uncomfortable. 
Would you like a cigarette?” The hat and jacket extracts a white cylinder from a small cardboard box.
“Oh god, please, yes.” Roscoe doesn’t know about much aside from instant gratification.
“But first. 
But first. 
What do you know about Canada?” The man with the cigarettes holds back.
“Canada? Like north of here?”
“Don’t fucking play stupid with us cocksucker! We have evidence!” The plain clothes snarls and growls.
“Evidence of what? Why am I here? You guys haven’t told me anything!”
“Look, kid. 
We can do this easy, or not so easy. 
But we’re going to do this our way. 
Irregardlessly.” The hat and jacket looks down on him still holding the cigarette just out of reach.
“Irregardlessly isn’t a word.”
“Shut the fuck up you little shit!” The plain clothes punches one of the empty chairs sending it across the room. 
“You fucking think this is a joke? You think we’re here to be funny? Do you think this is fucking funny time you fucking piece of shit punk?” He kicks the chair for emphasis.
“I don’t know what to think! I was in that horrible room for god knows how long, is it still today? When did you guys pick me up? And where’s my goddamn lawyer? When do I get my fucking phone call?!”
“YOU’RE NOT HERE TO ASK THE FUCKING QUESTIONS SHITWAD!” The plain clothes picks the chair up and smashes it on to the interrogation room floor. 
“I WANT SOME FUCKING ANSWERS AND I WANT THEM RIGHT FUCKING NOW!” Chair legs and splinters explode from ground zero, sending debris scattering in all directions.
“Jesus Christ!” Roscoe is on the verge of terror. 
Being mostly a peaceful man he hasn’t been around anything remotely like this. 
A new kind of fear overwhelms him. 
He’s deathly afraid he might piss himself soon. 
His body language displays acute signs of avoidance. 
He’s as far away from the chair and the angry man in street clothes. 
The hat and jacket puts the cigarette in his own mouth and lights it. 
Saying nothing.
“TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT FUCKING CANADA! WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THE CANADIANS!?” The cop begins stomping on the chair remains, kicking and screaming. 
He takes a metal chair leg and begins banging on the floors and the wall. 
Primal rage bellows from his diaphragm. 
He is the embodiment of the term “going ape shit.”
Roscoe is fighting with his bladder, his tear ducts, and sweat glands. 
He’s fighting every instinct that tries to make his body leak until the threat goes away. 
He is trying desperately to keep control over his bowels. 
The fight is painful. 
A war of resistance. 
Someone is going to have to clean this room up later. 
He will be a poor city worker, trying to find a way to land some workman’s comp and stay home with his son for a few days. 
He would rather not deal with the output from Roscoe’s body. 
He would rather not deal with piss and shit and tears and splinters. 
Not again.
The plain clothes cop kicks the splinters against the wall. 
He picks up the other chair and slams it against the door. 
He howls wildly. 
His mouth is foaming, his pupils dilated. 
His eyes wide with rage. 
The hat and jacket stands in the corner shaking his head and rolling his eyes. 
He’s seen this scene before. 
He is neither impressed nor intimidated. 
Pete really gets into his work.
“Look, kid. 
The sooner you start talking, the sooner we can get out of here and you can go back to whatever. 
Or Pete over there can mess up your chair next. 
He might take you along with it. 
He gets a little carried away sometimes.” The hat and jacket flicks ashes indiscriminately.
Roscoe starts cracking. 
“They found me! Ok!? They found me at one of the co-ops and asked me for an exclusive deal. 
They were ready to pay cash. 
 That’s all I know. 
I don’t want to ask questions… I don’t want to ask questions… I don’t… want…”
The hat and jacket removes his hat, becoming just a jacket smoking a cigarette. 
“So you admit you know the Canadians? And you did business with them?” He says this holding out a brand new never before smoked cigarette.
“Y- Yes. 
Yeah… I admit it. 
Was it really that serious? Just selling to Canada?”
“Son,” the Jacket says, “Son, when it comes to Canada, everything is serious.”
Chapter five.
Somewhere between California and Oregon. 
Somewhere there’s a spot on the side of the road with two old shoes, rotting away next to a broken cell phone in the weeds. 
The trees will continue growing. 
The wind will continue blowing. 
This is a place of constant transitions. 
Right between A and B. 
You will neither be here nor there when you are between. 
Parked dead center on the line, dissected in half on the border, is an old van, with one occupant. 
In front of the driver there is a current newspaper. 
He has a marker ready to draw circles. 
 He’s reading the obituaries over carefully. 
 Sometimes he circles them. 
Sometimes he doesn’t. 
He’s reading by the dashboard light. 
He has the local papers from five different counties on either side of the boarder. 
He’s looking for specific details of the death. 
Details that concern exactly how the person died. 
Anyone die from gang violence? Next. 
Anyone die from drunk driving, drowning, routine Darwinism? Sorry, not interested. 
Anyone dead because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, because they made a bad decision, or took a wrong turn? Not my problem. 
Anyone die from strange unexplainable ways, maybe and including involvement by aliens, governments, international conspiracies and slash or various religious organizations?  No. 
Oh, hell no. 
Not even close to what we’re looking for. 
 Anyone have a long struggle with cancer of the lungs, brain, breasts, throat, etc? Oh, he makes a circle. 
Oh, that’s very interesting. 
Tell me more.
Spencer Raleigh draws a circle around an obituary that marks the time and place of the funeral. 
It will take place in two days about three miles from here. 
Friends and family encouraged to attend. 
 Vernon Quimby, age seventy four. 
Survived by his wife, son and daughter, Quimby fought with cancer for seven years. 
He saw his son be fruitful and multiply. 
He saw his daughter bare crotch fruit. 
He saw bombs dropping, He saw bullets flying. 
He watched his friends being assassinated, presidents getting shot. 
He saw riots in the streets, police state tactics used on the dissenting citizens of the land of the free. 
He saw a lot of nonsense. 
During his final days he shook his head at a lot. 
 Because he was dying. 
And there were still a lot of stupid people doing stupid things for stupid reasons. 
 Quimby’s disposition at the moment of his death could be called dissatisfaction. 
Disappointment at his fellow human beings acting like complete savages towards each other. 
Believing totally in their own bullshit. 
Quimby did not die with a smile on his face. 
The look on Quimby’s face at the moment of death was something more like distain.
Spencer taps the marker on his head for a minute, looking for other candidates. 
There was an old woman that looked likely, but that was it. 
Slow weekend. 
At least for cancer research. 
At least for progressive, boarder line illegal cancer research. 
He bites on the inside of his lips, trying to plan a trip between two towns on the same day. 
Just after the funeral, when the dirt is fairly fresh. 
 Gas cost, traffic conditions at the projected time of arrival. 
Etc. 
Planning and plotting. 
Spence looks straight ahead as far as his headlights can see. 
He produces a tin canister and crumbles a small bit of dried marijuana onto the news paper. 
Then a pouch of tobacco. 
He rolls a small spliff and smokes until there’s nothing left but roach.
The trees are thick with old growth. 
The shadows long and impenetrable. 
This is nothing like the Texas border. 
All dirt and more dirt and flat lands. 
Always crossing the light in the dead of night, looking for tomorrow’s work. 
Spence has been at this job for over half a year now. 
All along the old Route 66. 
No longer called that, now just another highway. 
Just another collection of run down gas stations and diners with boarded up windows. 
 Dust on dust along a road full of pot holes. 
An antique show, showcasing bygone eras. 
Trailer parks and tract houses. 
There’s not much in the way of tourism any more. 
A few old communities still exist around these parts. 
Mostly paint chip facades and termite reservations. 
A few old churches, built with old wood on cracked foundations. 
Old churches with just the right kind of faulty wiring.
The scene was old Chicago. 
The outskirts where the industry is. 
Smoke stacks and factories. 
Warehouses and trucks up and down the streets at all hours. 
 Spencer Raleigh is five years old. 
His father’s been gone for four of those years. 
The boy spends most of his time at the public library. 
His mother spends her time working, paying rent, paying bills. 
Trying to keep a sandwich in her son’s mouth and the water running. 
Just maintain. 
 Just keep trying. 
Something will pay off. 
Keep scratching those lottery tickets. 
Something will come through. 
A rich relative will die someday. 
Just keep waiting. 
Survive.
Spence as a boy has learned to read well enough. 
That’s most of his time. 
He doesn’t do school in the normal sense. 
He doesn’t do classes and teachers and homework. 
He has his boy’s mind and his curiosity. 
He has all the time in the world. 
And books about damn near everything. 
The librarians know him by name and tolerate his presence. 
His mother. 
His mother they don’t know what to think of. 
His mother with haggard expression, tired eyes, wild hair. 
His mother that drops the boy off in the morning and picks him up just before closing. 
The boy sits small in large wooden chairs. 
A stack of books picked out for their pretty covers and fascinating titles. 
Books by the likes of Hakim Bay and Noam Chomsky. 
Books about politics and science. 
Religion and anti-religion. 
He read conspiracy theories. 
 He read and re-read Illuminatus! Between the ages of seven and twelve he read that book twenty three times. 
 He devoured books by Tim Leary, Bob Wilson, and Richard Dawkins. 
His childhood was marked by self education. 
He learned about the idea of god as an idea, not so much as an actual entity. 
He learned about the function of the state and the function of the individual. 
 Most importantly he learned never to trust anyone except himself. 
 And even then it was a fifty-fifty situation.
That was all the serious stuff. 
For fun, when his mind wasn’t busy expanding rapidly, absorbing and developing logical reasoning at an astounding pace, he read books about card games, thought puzzles, problem solving. 
There was no one around to consider Spencer a prodigy. 
His mother usually responded to his inquiries and statements with a robotic, “That’s nice dear.” She was busy keeping the machine going. 
She was busy pushing all the right buttons and pulling all the right levers. 
Just enough to keep a loaf of bread around. 
A jar of peanut butter. 
Maybe some jam if times were good.
Aside from the librarians and his mother, Spencer’s human contact was fairly limited. 
Sometimes he would tire of the library and wander around the streets of rural Chicago. 
He would hear and smell and see the things that could only be happening just outside of a major city. 
Where all the poor people live. 
On either side of the tracks. 
Rich people don’t live near the train. 
The noise drives them crazy. 
The vibrations of the freighters irritates them to levels of irrationality. 
Boxcars, more boxcars. 
Spencer as a boy would sit near the tracks and try counting them. 
He would count the number of boxcars that passed during a given hour on a certain day of the week and write the number down in his journal. 
He would return, weeks, months later. 
Same day of the week and check the numbers for consistency. 
He had all the time in the world.
He would wander the streets and hear the music played out on the boom boxes and pouring out of houses, the nightclubs, the passing Chevrolets. 
He came to love the noise, the constant hubbub and lights. 
The sirens, the strobes, the headlights. 
Everyone coming and going and staying the same. 
Fluctuating constants. 
 Spencer was the cities’ child. 
In the front seat of the van, Spencer the adult cracks a beer. 
He cracks the beer with both hands. 
He listens to the last unique sound break the dead of night silence half way between Oregon and California.
“Shitballs.” Spencer says after taking a long swig. 
He gives a long, drawn out exhale. 
Part of him waking up while another part is falling asleep. 
“Ok, ok.” He thinks out loud. 
There’s no one around to tell him that he’s talking to himself. 
“Ok, so let’s see. 
Let’s see. 
Where are we… and we need a few hours for regroup, rest and relax. 
Tomorrow, work starts at noon and then skips two towns down and begins again at three thirty.” He drinks again from the beer. 
“That should give me just enough time.”
Spencer turns on the radio and scans the stations. 
He scans through static until he hears a bass line and an echoing guitar. 
Mood music. 
Just what he needs. 
He turns the keys in the ignition and begins driving south into California. 
The tune is Soul Man as recorded by Sam and Dave.
Chapter six:
The drive from Santa Cruz to Berkeley takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half. 
Highway Seventeen winds it’s way over the hill and into the sprawl. 
South Bay to North, all four lanes or more. 
The commuters and carpoolers. 
Lanes of highway deep with traffic. 
Everyone with a place to be. 
The Chev makes due. 
Taking the curves as an old timer can. 
Maintaining. 
Laurel smokes a joint and takes the sun into account through rose colored shades. 
She passes the towering building letting her know she’s about to enter San Jose. 
She passes through Santa Clara and keeps going. 
Her foot barely varies in pressure on the gas pedal. 
 The buildings get thicker, the concrete becomes more pervasive. 
The road stretches on in all directions. 
She looks again at the map and scrawling her sister made before she left this morning.
“You sure these guys are going to be a good idea?”
“Don’t worry about it. 
These guys would not worry about it. 
They’d just deal. 
And that sounds like a great idea for you right about now.”
“I just don’t know Marj. 
This is kinda weird. 
What the fuck am I supposed to say?  Are they even expecting me? Did you call them?”
“No, I didn’t call. 
They’ll be cool with it. 
They like surprises. 
You’ll be welcome. 
Just trust me. 
I’m your older sister. 
 I’m here to help.”
That was all she left with. 
Words of wisdom from the elder. 
Go my child and seek the safe house. 
They will look after you while you figure out your next move. 
Fine. 
Just great. 
Shack up with a couple of strangers. 
No doubt a couple of fucking hippies. 
Ah well. 
Hippies are better than nothing. 
Besides, they might be able to help with business. 
Moving a little weight. 
Buying a little weight themselves. 
Might not be so bad. 
This could be a good thing. 
Think positive Laurel. 
Keep your thoughts on the bright side of things. 
Just look ahead and don’t worry about things you can’t fix right now. 
Everything is going to be fine.
Laurel pulls off the intersection. 
She takes the exit indicated and continues until she sees the cross street. 
She makes one loop around the block before seeing the right street and makes a turn. 
She parks her car and takes a long look at the apartment complex. 
A black metal gate blocks everything in. 
It should be one of those automatic car gates that slides in and out to let the occupants park their cars. 
The gate is broken open. 
Permanently slide in. 
She eyes this a little cautiously. 
Completely on her guard in foreign territory. 
She walks up to apartment fifteen and knocks twice, pauses and knocks three more times.
From within noises of struggle emanate. 
Wrestling with something and grunts and groans. 
Things falling over, the clatter of empty cans, the rustle of papers. 
The distinct sound of a lighter and then a man coughing violently. 
The door swings open in one swift motion, exposing two strangers to each other in the most dramatic of fashions. 
 A man in only shorts stands half hunched in the door way. 
A cigarette dangles out of his mouth and his eyes are bloodshot beyond redemption. 
His hair can’t make up its mind. 
 Deciding on all directions simultaneously. 
He laughs at you standing in front of him. 
“Aha! Ha ha! About fuckin’ time!” He walks away leaving the door open. 
Laurel stands there. 
Completely unsure about everything that just happened. 
 The man with multiple personality scalp crawls back into bed, a mattress in the corner of the living room. 
He pulls a blanket over himself and starts falling back asleep, still smoking. 
“Well, come in for chrissakes.” He says with eyes closed. 
“Don’t just stand there. 
Put your things inside, sit on the couch, whatever. 
Just come in, come in.” He flicks the ash into a tray a few inches away.
Laurel looks at the inside of the apartment. 
There’s a desk and some chairs. 
A low table. 
The mattress. 
The aforementioned couch. 
Bottles and cans are all over the place. 
Every available surface has been painted. 
Most of the furniture is broken in some place, but not entirely. 
There are at least three ashtrays with in visibility. 
A large American flag hangs between the small kitchen and the living room. 
 It hangs on five rings suspended on a rod like a shower curtain. 
The lines on all the stars have been drawn in, making pentagrams out of a spangled banner. 
Beggars, she’s thinking. 
Beggars can’t be choosers. 
 But these guys seems pretty tolerant. 
He doesn’t even know me. 
She takes a step inside, bracing herself for something to come jumping out at her. 
Nothing happens. 
The man on the mattress takes another inhale and lets it waft out of his open mouth. 
After both feet are through the door she feels much more comfortable. 
This will be a pretty relaxed stay. 
She can tell that no one is going to be demanding anything from her. 
But she’s welcome to do as she pleases. 
Laurel looks around at the walls covered in scraps of paper. 
In doodles and words. 
A collage of the collective brain power of two strange men with time and writing utensils.
There’s a small hallway and what looks like a restroom at the end. 
She does need to pee. 
It’s about that time. 
She closes the door and see another ashtray. 
Right by the can. 
She washes up and and reenters the living room. 
The man is passed out, the cigarette extinguished. 
Only his snoring is heard. 
She figures she might as well move the bags inside. 
This can’t be that bad.
The bags all inside and Laurel on the couch. 
She rests her head and closes her eyes and rests a minute. 
 There’s a red hash pipe on the table in front of her. 
She figures, why not? She packs a bowl and sparks it, getting a bit more stoned than she was on arrival. 
The door in the hallway opens soon afterward. 
A mess walks out, scratching his ass and proceeds directly into the bathroom. 
He pisses enthusiastically with the door wide open. 
He hears a sudden coughing coming from the living room couch. 
“Oh ho! When did that get here? Good morning, good morning!” The mess walks out under a beard and sleepy eyes. 
 He sees a girl sitting on the couch with a bowl to her lips and the roommate asleep on the mattress in the corner. 
He laughs at her. 
He laughs all the way into the kitchen and opens the fridge, extracting a cold beer. 
Laurel has been laughed at twice in the last fifteen minutes. 
She finds this a strange kind of hello, nice to meet you.
“Wanna beer?” The mess tosses her one before she answers. 
“Good, have a beer. 
Beer for breakfast never did no one no harm.” He wipes head from his face. 
He throws one at the man on the mattress and it hits his stomach, jolting him awake.
“We can sleep later. 
We have a guest. 
How about food? How about Hamm’s and eggs? Hamm’s and eggs it is.” The mess walks back into the kitchen and begins cleaning a pan and turning the stove on. 
He gets out eggs and butter and more beer. 
He scratches his balls and chest, cracking eggs into a healthy dollop of melting butter. 
The man on the mattress cracks his beer and takes a mean guzzle. 
He drinks and drinks and ends with a loud belch.
“Woo! That’s so much better than coffee.”
“Tell me about it. 
How do you like your eggs?”
“Cooked.” The man on the mattress belches again.
“Not you! The guest. 
The guest on the couch that doesn’t speak. 
She might be a mute. 
I hope she’s deaf, she has no idea we’re talking about her and eggs right now. 
I’d get that pipe out of her hands. 
Could be dangerous. 
Investigate.”
“I can hear and speak just fine.” Laurel says.
“Good lord it talks!” The mess giggles to himself. 
“So guest, what brings you about?”
“Umm, my sister told me to see you guys for some reason.”
“You have a sister? That’s fantastic.” The mattress man shakes his can, listening to the last undrinkable drops clattering in the bowels of an aluminum beer container. 
No matter how many times you tilt the can and try to get that last bit out, the drops will be there. 
Dancing away in the bottom of the can. 
Dancing a dance of mockery. 
“Re-beer!” He calls towards the kitchen.
“Re-beer!” The response comes back in form of a flying can caught and cracked.
“Yeah, I have a sister. 
She’s from Santa Cruz. 
I think you guys know her.”
“The plot thickens. 
Excellent. 
Does your sister have name?”
“Most people call her Marjorie, or Marji. 
Anything along those lines.”
“M-Unit! Fuck yeah! How is the old girl doing?”
“You know. 
She maintains. 
She’s pretty much the same.”
“So, M-Unit’s sister, what brings you to our humble couch?”
“Laurel. 
Call me Laurel.”
“Alright Lars,” The mess throws an empty can at the wall. 
“What’s your story? And stop parking, that’s terribly rude.”
Laurel passes the pipe to the man on the mattress. 
He squints at her with rambling eyes, taking in two beers and premature wakefulness. 
He looks like a man in a state of shambles. 
He looks like the end of misled youth. 
He takes the pipe and sparks with a Bic, taking the long inhale to the point of no return. 
He lets the cloud out slowly. 
He gestures wildly with the pipe towards the kitchen. 
The mess with the pan takes it and continues where the shambles left off, pulling deep into the lungs. 
He exhales and hands it back to Laurel.
The pipe back in her hands she starts retelling her story. 
The story isn’t terribly long. 
She doesn’t know a whole lot of the details. 
But it takes a while. 
She’s a little stoned right now. 
When she comes back around there’s a paper plate with two eggs in front of her, a fresh beer and toast with jam. 
The mess and the shambles have already eaten and look at her inquisitively. 
“That’s it?” The shambles says smoking again.
“That’s brings us up to now at least. 
I don’t think it’s quite done yet. 
But yeah, I’d prefer not to be around my house for a while until I know what’s going on with Roscoe.” Laurel takes not so much a dainty sip from her can of Hamm’s.
“Well, you know whatever works. 
If you need a place to crash, I think we can oblige.” The shambles takes to blowing smoke rings and leaning against the wall. 
“But let’s see. 
Do we have any plans?” The shambles looks at the mess and they start laughing in low voices.
“Ok, ok. 
But seriously. 
Should be fine. 
I really don’t see why not. 
You seem pretty chill. 
And you’re M-Unit’s sister. 
That makes you pretty cool by association. 
 And pretty, cool people are always welcome here. 
Don’t worry. 
Take your time. 
Also this is fantastic weed.” The shambles blows two perfect rings towards the ceiling.
“Oh the weed! That’s right. 
I might need to get rid of a lot of it. 
You know, for financial purposes. 
Getting the boy out of jail or something. 
Who knows? Could be lawyers and all kinds of trouble. 
But yeah, I think I need to sell some weed for a while. 
Know anyone that wants to buy?”
“Off the top of my head, most of the people I know.” The mess lights a cigarette and washes his mouth out with beer. 
“Besides, students all over this place. 
Lots of weed in town already but always room for more. 
I’m sure we can unload some of it for you. 
How much are you looking to get rid of?”
“I dunno. 
Maybe fifty pounds?”
The guys in the room look stunned. 
They both stare at nothing in particular for a full minute.
“Did you just say fifty pounds?” The shambles has ashed on his pants and doesn’t particularly care.
“Jesus.”  The mess continues staring.
“Well Lars, that’s a lot to get rid of quickly. 
Unless we can find a buyer that takes large amounts. 
Most of the guys we know buy in dimes or dubs or eighths. 
Maybe one or two guys that want the odd ounce or two. 
But mostly, it’s small fries. 
 But I’ll make a few phone calls. 
Something will come up.” The shambles snubs out a butt and sits back with a sigh. 
“Dude, are we going to be drug dealers for a while?”
“I think so, dude. 
This is going to be awesome.”
“That’s righteous.”
Laurel takes a look around the apartment. 
There is no television. 
No radio. 
A lot of paper and books and ashtrays. 
“Man. 
You guys live like monks here.”
“Ha! If this is monasticism, then god help us.” The mess throws another empty can at the wall close to the trash box.
Chapter seven;
There’s something about the houses of geriatrics. 
The smell is something that always lingers. 
It will always smell old in the home of an old person. 
It will be a dull smell. 
Not quite like rot, but close to it. 
Not quite like stagnation, or the smell of dead dreams hidden in the closet. 
It will be a smell of decay, gradual and slightly off putting. 
 Something a long time coming towards death, but not there yet. 
Some people erroneously contribute this to mothballs. 
But they are wrong. 
It is the smell of someone fading away. 
The sense of smell triggers memory better than any other sense a human has. 
The sense of smell is also dulled by familiarity easier than the other senses. 
 Juniper notices nothing unusual about the smell of her home. 
She has walked the halls and lingered in the kitchen long enough never to notice anything about it ever again. 
Juniper Marie Gladstone was born in nineteen twenty three. 
She was born the year of Mailer, the year of Kissinger. 
She has seen the great depression. 
The whole of the Second World War. 
The Vietnam War. 
The Korean War, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
She’s no stranger to conflicts coming from the TV screen. 
Juniper has seen the world being torn apart and rebuilt time and again. 
She was around before antidepressants, when birth control as a pill was just an idea, when attention deficit disorder wasn’t even a vague notion in the minds of the therapists and school consolers. 
By her own account she had lived a full, rich life.
Jun never needed to see a shrink when her husband died. 
She didn’t need more help than her friends could offer. 
All she needed was the comfort that god would take care of things. 
She went to church and prayed for her husband. 
She prayed that the bills would be paid on time, that the retirement fund would never run dry. 
She prayed that god had a plan. 
Jun’s plan was god’s plan. 
She could sleep peacefully because of this. 
Jun went to church every Sunday to ensure that god would be on her side. 
She would plead and beg and ask sincerely for god’s attention and mercy. 
Her husband was still dead. 
The house still reeked of loneliness. 
Those were two constants in Jun’s life. 
Two things that could never be changed. 
In the musty dining room of her ranch house, somewhere in the middle of suburbia, Midwest, Juniper sips her tea and looks out the window. 
She watches the autumn rains smack against the window panes and stares outside, taking gradual sips of perfectly brewed Jasmine tea. 
Normally should would have made cookies to go with her tea. 
Today, however she was not expecting company and the rains would ensure no unexpected guests would drop by. 
When she was alone there was no need for cookies. 
Besides, with the way her back has been acting up her doctor said any unnecessary bending over should be avoided. 
So much for opening ovens. 
This suited her just fine. 
Her tea would keep her company. 
Her tea and the rain were the only companions she needed right now.
In her younger days, before the back pain, before Robert passed away and left her the house and the old Volkswagen that since remained parked in the driveway. 
In her younger days she loved to walk around on days like this. 
Days when the rain wasn’t a storm, but wasn’t a sprinkle. 
When it was just enough to soak you to the bone but not so bad that you caught a cold. 
Robert had taught her about these days. 
As a child she never ventured out in supposedly ill weather. 
Robert taught her that the weather wasn’t ill, that was just her silly ideas being stamped on the weather. 
Weather was always neutral. 
The weather had no concept of good or bad or harmful or beneficial. 
The rain fell regardless. 
These days she rarely went outside except on Sundays. 
And then it was primarily to go to church and back. 
Back to church in the evening for bingo and town gossip. 
The gossip mostly centered around other people’s children. 
She was always fascinated by the goings on of other people’s kids, having none of her own. 
Not that she didn’t want children. 
 Not that she didn’t try. 
But there were always problems. 
Something always prevented her from conceiving. 
But that was a long time ago and by now she was very much over the idea. 
She was much too old to be fussing over the idea of children. 
She was content to live vicariously through the other women of the town. 
The younger women troubled her. 
Their children always seemed so beyond control. 
Always running about, causing ruckus and noise and getting into the strangest kind of trouble. 
Trouble that made no sense to Juniper. 
The kids these days with their privileges. 
Kids with phones they could carry around in their pockets. 
Goodness, when she was a girl what she wouldn’t have given for a portable telephone. 
 Not to mention how they always seemed to be listening to music, everywhere they went. 
To be able to listen to music independently of records or cassette tapes. 
 Even those new CDs seemed like some kind of space age fantasy. 
And now they needed nothing except a small metal box that could fit in a pocket. 
Right next to their phones. 
She’s heard rumors that even the phones are able to play music  ow. 
But she doesn’t believe it.
Jun marveled at these things but never interacted. 
She never inquired or bothered to catch up as the young mothers at church had. 
She was not interested in being part of this modern age. 
 She possessed no inclination to try and understand what any of it meant. 
 Where it was all going. 
She missed having Robert around. 
 He would have known what to do. 
He would have explained this strange phenomenon to her in a way that pacified and calmed her into accepting and remaining detached. 
He was so good at that. 
She met Robert for the second time when he came home from the Navy. 
He was a handsome man walking into town with an army issue duffel bag, a clean hair cut and a sincere smile that was slightly condescending. 
Like he knew something that no one else did and was going to keep his secrets. 
And how he looked in that uniform. 
All fit and tanned from hours in the sun on one of those humungous boats with all those guns out in the Pacific. 
Robert said that war was a very silly thing. 
That was the most she ever got out of him. 
A very silly thing to be involved in.
When he returned to the small town he grew up in he met Juniper when she was teaching the younger grades at the elementary school. 
 Her hair was bright auburn then. 
She wore it up in a bun so as not to succumb to vanity. 
She did love her hair. 
When Robert and Juniper met it was an over cast day and they were the only two people in the post office. 
He was picking up a check and she was writing her parents, telling them how wonderful small town life was, and how she was so fulfilled teaching the next generation of children about the geography of the United States. 
Only half of her letter was full of lies. 
Robert had just been hired to work for the local newspaper, covering sports and human interests. 
It wasn’t exactly love at first sight. 
Especially since they had met before when they were in high school. 
Back then, he was a track star. 
Back then, she was a bookworm. 
 Always watching from a distance. 
Now as two adults. 
Now seeing each other again for the very first time. 
It was one of those moments that belongs with graceful cello music accompanied by bright violins and maybe a small brass section. 
The background music would be uplifting. 
The background music will make your heart race and your chest swell. 
You will be in a state of attention and affection when you listen to the background music for the moment that Robert and Juniper met for the second time.
The winter would be coming soon. 
Juniper stares at the rain and drinks her tea. 
Nothing quite like a good cup of tea on a rainy day. 
She was proud of her tea. 
She made it very well. 
She bought the delicate imported stuff when it was on sale. 
She was very proud of her tea. 
 Juniper thought of tea as something that should be graceful. 
Graceful like the dancers in those old movies. 
That Fred Astaire. 
He sure could dance. 
Juniper would, in her younger days, dream of dancing in those elegant dresses. 
Dresses that seemed to make the woman underneath an ethereal spirit. 
Moving with unfettered grace. 
Moving around a stage like the taste of perfectly brewed tea.
The rain continued to fall. 
Completely unwavering. 
Juniper Gladstone continued looking out the window, lost in her dining room. 
Unconcerned with whether or not the weather would change. 
Unconcerned in general. 
She sipped and she sat. 
Thinking quietly to herself.
Chapter Eight.
It was one of those towns. 
Where the men drank the cheap wine and the women drank the cheaper wine. 
Spencer’s van had two new occupants. 
 A male and a female. 
Both of them not much for conversation.
“Well,” Spencer talks to his guests, “Well, looks like we’re going to be stuck with each other for a few hours and might as well get to know each other.” He looks at two of the newspapers where had drawn circles. 
“Mr… Quimby?  Quimby right? You seem like you lived a pretty full life. 
Body’s in good shape for an old man. 
Put on some meat, probably had a decent wife. 
 Took care a ya in your old age. 
Not so bad. 
Well, sir. 
Well now. 
You have been called to a higher purpose. 
Hopefully somewhere in your freshly exhumed body we can find out how to prevent the deaths of thousands. 
You’d be a hero in spirit. 
But no one will ever know your name. 
 Except me.” Spencer is parked on the far side of the cemetery. 
He used to park closer but ever since he bought the wheel chair, life has been pretty easy. 
 Today he wheeled Mr. 
Quimby around, taking a good look at many headstones and crypts. 
Spotting the differences in the rich dead and the poor dead. 
“See, that’s real marble on that stone. 
Family had some money. 
But it’s not too large and not so small. 
 He was a modest man from a modestly rich family. 
A real middle grounder. 
But down there. 
That big fucker, with the pillars. 
That dude had some bank. 
He pulled some weight, believe you me.” Quimby said nothing. 
 He sat slumped in the wheel chair. 
His head bobbing up and down with roll of things. 
A few smudges of dirt in the places Spence had to touch him while loading him up. 
You’d think it would be easy to stand out in a cemetery in broad daylight. 
You’d think someone would notice you digging up a corpse just after noon when the sun was shining. 
But you’d be wrong. 
If you wear a uniform while you do all of this, no one will ask questions. 
You’re just doing your job. 
Everyone can tell. 
Because you wear a uniform. 
 You make the task of digging up six feet of dirt look like the pain in the ass that it is. 
You hit a coffin. 
Uncover half of the top. 
Just enough to open it and extract the body. 
Pull the old bastard out. 
Prop him up in the chair. 
Give him a blanket over his legs. 
A nice wide brimmed hat. 
Give him the FDR treatment. 
Close the casket, and pile all that dirt back in. 
No one needs to know. 
Then just wheel someone around for a while and load them into the van whenever you’re ready. 
 
Spencer looks in the back of the van and sees two body bags. 
Nothing except him is moving or making a sound. 
He sighs and lights a cigarette. 
Almost time to make the phone call. 
Set up an extraction point. 
 Those guys like the bodies as fresh as possible. 
The less decay the better. 
All those valuable cancer cells. 
The middle man for this operation was one of the most useful sons of bitches Spence ever met. 
He could get just about anyone in touch with anyone else. 
He was the great connecter. 
 He was the go to guy for any kind of business. 
Need to get rid of something? Just a phone call away. 
Need to get out of the country? Need a new identity? It can be arranged. 
 The guy in between would always be there. 
 Right between you and what you need. 
That’s his domain. 
And he plays all the right hands.
“House Party Joe. 
My man, my man.”
“Hey Spence. 
Right on time. 
The Northerners are looking for you.”
“Figured they would be. 
I’ve got a couple of cold ones for ‘em.”
“Excellent. 
Whereabouts are you this time?”
“Bumfuck, NorCal. 
I’m think I’m thirty miles outside Eureka. 
 Give or take.”
“Give or take what?”
“About thirty miles.”
“Well, if you make it to Eureka by seven. 
Ish. 
I can have a guy meet you at the Motel Six Hundred. 
 Room number…” He pauses, searching for a scrap of paper, “ah, room number sixty six.”
“Sweet. 
I think I can manage that. 
Sevenish. 
That should be more than enough time.”
“Dude, it would take you like an hour at most to get there. 
You are, at most, sixty minutes from Eureka, yeah?”
“Yeah, give or take. 
Thanks Joe. 
Call me when you hear back from our friends over the border.”
“Will do. 
Don’t get pulled over.”
“I make no promises.”
“Alright man. 
As you please.”
“Right on. 
Later.” Spencer hangs up. 
He flicks the butt of the cigarette into the street and starts the engine. 
“Give or take me getting a little shit faced. 
 Ha ha!” The van roars down the street, trying to find the easiest way to get to a bar near the Motel Six Hundred in Eureka.
Chapter nine;
The downtown Berkeley Bart station expels you between Center and Allston on Shattuck. 
It’s a grand piece of street with large bank buildings and lots of brick. 
When you take the escalator up to the sidewalk it will feel like riding the conveyor belt to urban everywhere. 
 There’s typically a person busking right before the escalator. 
The music won’t be great but it will be a traveler in between places. 
Trying to make fare. 
Probably going to San Francisco. 
Everyone in the station is coming or going or waiting for a train. 
They zig-zag and cross paths and wander about, looking for exits and not looking at each other. 
You will be the clever one. 
You will take the elevator, bypassing the turnstile, taking a free ride on the rapid transit express way to Berkeley California. 
Home of the one block section of space designated for your kind of people. 
The kind of people that don’t have homes to sleep in.
People’s Park isn’t much to look at. 
There’s a field and some trees. 
Lots of logs to sit on. 
The odd camp here and there. 
Just a collection of bedding and very few personal artifacts. 
There’s a public restroom that will never be clean. 
 A barbeque pit that’s seldom in use. 
A small garden where nothing much grows. 
People come, people go. 
It’s their park, and they can do with it as they please. 
In Northern California there are a few places referred to as Sanctuary Cities. 
 These are places where the homeless and outcast, the lost and weary are free to sleep on the benches and bus stops. 
Where they can find a night of rest without worrying about a camping ticket. 
Charging someone money for not having a place to sleep. 
That’s about as American as it gets. 
No home, no friends, nowhere to crash?  That’ll be three hundred dollars. 
How typically American.
Beecher stands at the corner of Center and Shattuck. 
His possessions are few. 
He has a coat and a hat. 
Old gloves that keep his hands warm. 
He has old boots that only let the water in when the water has nowhere else to go. 
His clothes have been stained so many times in so many ways that they both have the same, dull everything at once coloring. 
The holes have been patched. 
The patches grew holes and were patched again. 
Beecher holds on to any good thing he can get and keeps it until it is beyond repair. 
The path to People’s Park from the Bart Station wanders in a number of different ways depending on the disposition of the pedestrian. 
Oxford Lane will take you into the campus for the University of California. 
The path will be lined with trees and students procrastinating between classes. 
Oxford Lane will take you along into the west entrance of the campus. 
Keep on the path; you’ll get to Telegraph in no time. 
There will be a plaza or two and then you’ll see Bancroft being a cross street. 
At the corner there will be a hotdog cart. 
There will be a sexy drawing of a girl dressed up in a hotdog costume. 
This may never make sense to you. 
How does a sexy hotdog girl make me want to eat hotdogs? Why would this circumvent circuits in my brain against rational hotdog purchasing? Why do hotdog have to be sexy? Can’t we be content with something simply being delicious instead enticing and alluring? Do we really need the sexy element outside of say, things that are actually sexual? Is that really necessary?  Condiments of catsup and money-shot mustard in each of her hands. 
Her body deep between the bun and a line three deep at the hotdog cart.
Beecher waits for the light and looks both ways. 
He’s not the type of person that needs a light to tell him what to do. 
He can manage to navigate the streets of a city with his eyes and ears and doesn’t need the chirping of mechanical birds to tell him when it is safe to cross the street. 
He still presses the button and prefers to cross when all the lights are in his favor. 
But if the light is red and there’s no sign of danger, why not trust your instincts? You are smarter than a red light. 
You can cross the street. 
No one’s going to stop you. 
Don’t worry about it.
Telegraph Avenue starts off a little gentrified, but don’t worry. 
It’s gets better. 
There’s a chain drug store and of all things, another bank. 
There are corporate stores with corporate offices far from Berkeley, California. 
But give it a block. 
The inherent nature of the town will take shape soon enough. 
The grunge will come through. 
The grittier, more honest side of things will come around. 
The mom and pop hole in the wall shops. 
 Head shops and a palm reader. 
Various eateries, but nothing terribly distinctive. 
Decent fast food, most of the time. 
Which is perfect for this time and place. 
You don’t really want to linger too long in one spot. 
The place dictates that movement is a positive experience. 
You feel like you should keep going. 
Past the music stores, selling sounds on just about any format. 
A floor full of records. 
One full of CDs. 
They probably sell cassettes in here someplace. 
The idea of entering a music shop is a special kind of depressing. 
You can look and gather up a collection of albums. 
You will find just about everything you’ve ever wanted and never knew you needed. 
At the end you’ll have to retrace your steps and put back the ones you can’t afford. 
Trimming your stack down to a reasonable, affordable size.
Take a left soon. 
This will take you to the park. 
The last resting place of the tired traveler types. 
You’re free to set up shop here for a few days. 
No one is going to mind your presence. 
You’ll be welcome. 
The scavengers will find you first. 
Don’t worry about them. 
They’ll be distracted easily enough. 
 Someone else will start smoking something or drinking from somewhere. 
And the scavengers will know about it. 
 Somehow. 
They will always know. 
Beecher takes a minute to rest and relax. 
He rests his head on a log and lays his feet out in front of him. 
He decides it’s the perfect time of day for a nap. 
The citizens of the park do as they may. 
He will have some sleep. 
He dreams and rests and closes his eyes. 
He rests for a few hours. 
A boy with army issue camo pants and very bad hair cut approaches.
“Hey man. 
Hey. 
Man. 
Hey man.” The staccato of the boy’s voice wakes Beecher up form half sleep. 
The half bum in transition. 
“What is it my son?” Beecher coughs at the boy, barely making an attempt to cover his mouth with his hand. 
“Hey man. 
Hey.” The boy continues.
“We did that part already. 
I’m on the next verse. 
Let’s move on.” Beecher is tired and doesn’t really feel like listening to repetition from the mouth of a youth.
“I’m from L.A.”  He says this with a note of finality. 
As if he’s made his point.
“I’m very happy for you. 
That must be a fascinating place to be from. 
All kinds of activity and nonsense and tons of people doing wacky things for attention. 
Yes, L.A. 
is a fascinating place to be from.” Beecher the half bum. 
Always seems to attract the nutty ones.
“No. 
Man. 
What I mean is. 
What I’m trying to say. 
What. 
Well.” The boy stammers, shaking his leg and looking around nervously. 
“What I mean is. 
Do you. 
Maybe. 
You got a smoke, man?”
Beecher looks at him in frustration.
“Let a man sleep. 
Piss off.” He closes his eyes again and drifts to sleep.
The kid continues standing there. 
Unsure of what to do next. 
He hadn’t counted on failing to get a cigarette. 
He looks at Beecher. 
He looks lost and confused.
“Hey. 
Man.” The youth looks at his feet and shuffles around, nervous like.
Beecher cracks one eye, part way between apathy and annoyance.
“Yes? What is it now?” Just a little peace and quiet. 
That’s all he wants.
“Where are we?”
“You are here now. 
That’s all you need to know. 
 Maybe you want to be there, then. 
In which case, you should get a move on. 
Right here right now isn’t a place you should be. 
If I were you. 
I’d go and bum a smoke off one of the kids that hangs out in front of the bars or coffee shops. 
There’s a place down the way that invented the latte. 
A latte is like coffee but the milk is already mixed in. 
It’s a drink for pussies. 
Pussies that don’t really like coffee, but sometimes they like to pretend that they do. 
 But they have to go outside to smoke. 
I’m not so much allowed inside places. 
I have to smoke outside. 
So, since I’m always outside, I’m always out of smoke. 
Fuck off.” The half bum closes his eyes again, feeling pretty good about resolving that issue.
“Look. 
Dude. 
Man.”
“What is it?! For fuck’s sake man. 
I’m trying to fucking sleep!”
“Ok, woah. 
Ok. 
Jesus. 
Look. 
Look. 
Ok. 
What I’m trying to say. 
What I’m getting at. 
Is like. 
 Maybe. 
I don’t know what there is to do in this town. 
What should I do?”
Beecher props himself up on one arm and stares at the boy. 
His crusty hair. 
His mangled beard. 
He looks at the dirt under his chewed fingernails. 
He’s perpetually stained hands. 
His worn out clothes. 
“Ok, kid. 
I think I know what your problem is. 
You need a guru. 
You need a leader. 
Obviously, you have no mind to think for yourself and make your own decisions. 
You can’t make up your mind. 
You don’t know where you are. 
You don’t even know how to kill a few hours until something distracts you. 
This is your problem. 
This is what they call boredom. 
It’s a disease. 
I haven’t proven that yet, but I’ve got most of the paper work done and it’s only a matter of time before they take me seriously. 
I know all about the plague of boredom sweeping the nation. 
It’s been coming in waves ever since they started printing comic books and real life could never match up to that kind of intensity. 
Ever since someone made comic books and those Fantastic Stories magazines. 
Some kid somewhere in the middle of fucking farmland, U.S.A. 
is looking outside his window. 
All he sees are cornfields and bean fields and a bunch of those goddamn bean eaters harvesting the lot. 
He looks out his window and doesn’t see a superman or a super anything. 
He sees grains and fields and cow shit. 
Real life will never have the pace or flow of a comic book. 
That kid will grow up and work the farm and go to school and get a job and keep looking out his window. 
And he will never see anything nearly as marvelous as what he saw in those fucking comic books. 
 That’s not unlike your problem. 
You grew up with everything in the world at your disposal. 
Now look at you. 
Encrusted with the grime of being perpetually lost in a sea of every possibility. 
 You have nowhere to go because you could be anywhere right now. 
So you’re nowhere in particular, bumming smokes off a man that’s just trying to take a nap. 
Now what are you going to do?”
The youth shakes his head. 
He still doesn’t know. 
It’s been fascinating listening to the half bum speak for so long, but he’s still nowhere at all.
Beecher sighs. 
“Alright. 
So you still don’t know. 
I figured as much. 
Don’t worry about it. 
As long as you don’t worry about it, something will come along and distract you. 
Just be open to it. 
Your distractions will lead you in the right direction. 
At first it will seem like they are unreasonable impulses. 
This is false. 
They are signals to your brain telling you where to go. 
Just pay attention and you’ll end up where you need to be. 
It’s not so complicated. 
Life is a pretty simple game. 
Believe me. 
I only speak truth.”
The youth seems disappointed. 
He seems just as lost as when this whole discussion began.
“So… what you’re saying is… You don’t have a cigarette to bum me?”
“Oh fuck off and get arrested. 
You sicken me.” Beecher lies down and closes his eyes. 
He has no need for the youth of this land disturbing him. 
He has nothing to offer except wisdom and advice.
The kid stumbles off in another direction, hands in his pockets, not so deep in thought. 
Just waiting for something to come along and give him a cigarette. 
Beecher begins to dream. 
He dreams of cheering crowds and banners with his name on it. 
He dreams of the mob in his favor. 
They are chanting and holding him aloft. 
They want him to lead them. 
They want to look to him for guidance. 
They hang on his every word and praise his every gesture, however meaningless. 
There are lights and flash bulbs and fanatics. 
They want to make him their leader. 
He’s just being swept away in the tide of madness. 
Happy to be caught up in a crowd that doesn’t want to see him rot away behind bars.
Chapter Ten.
The sprawl is no place to have a parish. 
That’s what he heard all the time, trying to start up a community of true believers. 
The sprawl is unforgiving and relentless. 
That’s perfect, thought Reverend Carmichael. 
That’s why I should be there. 
Because someone needs to fill that gap. 
I can be forgiving. 
I will give hope and peace back to the suburban wasteland. 
They need me out there. 
That’s exactly where I should be. 
In the den of his home, Rev. 
Carmichael takes a long pull from the pint of rum in his hands. 
They need me, he thought. 
They need me and I need them. 
It’s going to work out someday. 
Just trust the lord. 
He will provide. 
The lord giveth and taketh away. 
It’s been ten years. 
Let it go already. 
There was a drunk driver. 
There was an ambulance. 
There were sirens and gurneys and people in uniforms asking questions. 
There were familiar bodies in unfamiliar positions, no longer moving. 
Ten years is a long time. 
Ten years is a long time to grieve. 
Give it time. 
Time will heal all wounds, however deep. 
That’s what they told him. 
They told him they were in Heaven now. 
They were with god and he was still here. 
And now he was all alone. 
That goddamn drunkard and that blind corner.
Pictures of his family line the mantle. 
Above a fireplace he refuses to use. 
Pictures of dead faces long buried. 
It was tragic. 
That’s what the newspapers called it. 
 A tragedy. 
There is no word for what that was. 
There is no word in the English language that encompasses the feeling of having your entire family killed in one blinding moment. 
In one big crash and sudden slamming stop with shattering glass and then silence that could fill a canyon. 
There is no word for the feeling that comes ten years afterward. 
The best we have is grief. 
Is loss. 
Is coping. 
Is sitting frozen forever in the faces above the mantle. 
Rev. 
Carmichael drinks and looks at the pictures. 
He looks at the pictures and drinks and looks at nothing. 
He feels the dizziness in his head and the emptiness in his chest and looks at nothing. 
He stares for a good hour in the den of his empty home where he lives and sleeps. 
His church is across the street. 
Just a single story structure with one front door and one back door. 
A small cemetery off to the side for the good people that passed away. 
Passed away. 
That’s what they call it. 
Passing. 
How trite and pacifying. 
 Like just passing through. 
Just passing by. 
Just passing away. 
The reverend takes another pull, right off the bottle. 
Tomorrow is Sunday. 
Correction. 
Today is Sunday, as of two hours ago. 
He has a sermon to write. 
He’s thinking tomorrow is a good day to preach about Pilate. 
Pilate the politician. 
Pilate that didn’t really do much. 
Pilate that had the life of Christ at his disposal and did nothing to aid him. 
That’s a huge oversimplification of the ordeal. 
Really, Pilate wanted to get rid of Jesus, but not kill him. 
He saw Jesus as not his problem. 
He did everything in his power not to deal with the Jesus phenomenon. 
 He constantly found no fault in him. 
He was about to release him to the mob. 
But the mob called for a murderer instead. 
 Another revolutionary that was violent and prone to acts of inspiring. 
 The mob loves violence. 
The mob loves someone that’s not afraid to kill one or two people to make a point. 
And that is one of the reasons the mob is stupid. 
Don’t be a part of the mob. 
Don’t just shout along with the others because you’re part of a group. 
They will mislead you. 
This sounds like a silly message to convey to a church community. 
Where they will all nod their heads in unison.
As a boy, Rev. 
Carmichael would think, what would Dashiell Hammett do? What would Raymond Chandler do? What would Sam Spade do? Well, they’d probably get drunk and forget about it. 
But the mysteries were already solved. 
There was nothing left to uncover. 
There were no bad guys in the shadows. 
There was nothing left except half a pint of rum and an unwritten sermon and the people that lived in between cities. 
No quite the big city or the smaller city off to the side. 
The continual in between. 
Neither here nor there. 
The sprawl. 
Just the excess of one city or another spewing out onto the concrete streets. 
The pattern of post office, mechanic, barber shop, corner store, liquor store, mechanic, barber shop, liquor store, beauty salon, corner store that sells liquor, restaurant where no one speaks English as a first language. 
The sprawl is just a never ending pattern extending in all directions until you come across the wilderness. 
Until the trees or the hills or the dust comes back to try and reclaim the land.
The good reverend sits in a large easy chair. 
The soft cushions doing little to comfort him. 
He looks at the yellow legal pad in front of him and scrawls various ideas for a sermon. 
Preacher man with a head full of pity. 
He doesn’t feel like teaching fire and brimstone lessons any more. 
He’s not one to be condemning the people tomorrow. 
He just wants everyone to care for each other. 
He’s thinking tomorrow is a good day for some Good Samaritan sermonizing. 
He makes a list of verses to quote. 
 He makes a few notes for anecdotes from his life and the lives of others that demonstrate the power of one person to lend a hand. 
That no one is above helping someone out when they have the power to. 
That everyone has the power to get the poor bastard off the street for a minute.
Rev. 
Carmichael throws the empty bottle into the fireplace. 
He hears the glass break and slumps in his chair, letting the legal pad fall on the floor near his slippers. 
He looks at the mantle and his wife’s face looking down on him. 
He looks at her and sees the blood on her forehead. 
The way her face looked with bits of windshield stuck in her skin. 
How the red stains turned brown on her clothes. 
How his son looked with his neck broken and his daughter looked smashed between the front and back seats. 
And how he had survived the whole thing. 
With only a neck brace and a broken leg. 
The limp remained. 
Every time he walked a ripple of pain would shoot up his back and he would remember everything. 
He would never heal completely. 
He knew this and looked at the broken bottle in the fireplace. 
The good reverend wept.
Chapter eleven. 
Every decent town has at least one dive bar. 
The dive bar will be near or in the low income housing district. 
The paint will be five or so years past fresh. 
The décor will vary greatly depending on the specific geography and intent of the owner. 
There will be a few things you can count on in a dive bar. 
There will be cheap beer there. 
And there will be whiskey in one form or another. 
The good dive bars allow smoking. 
The not so good ones let you smoke in certain places at certain times. 
The bad ones don’t allow smoking at all. 
That’s how to tell if it’s really a dive bar or just poor old watering hole. 
The bartenders should be a bit surly. 
They shouldn’t trust anyone that hasn’t been coming here for at least a year. 
They won’t trust anyone that doesn’t believe in drinking in a bar before sunset. 
Dive bars are the perfect place to get drunk when it’s still light outside. 
Inside the bar, the lighting will never change. 
It will always be dim. 
It should always be a little smoky. 
And the music could be anywhere. 
A decent dive bar will play a lot of blues, classic rock, old country music, or obscure punk. 
A really nice dive bar will play all of the above with no regard to playlists or following a theme. 
The not so decent dive bars will play a lot of Indy rock. 
They play it with an air of superiority. 
Like if you don’t know the band and all of the members first names, their musical history, all the other bands they’re currently playing in and have played for. 
The tragic shortcomings of failed attempts at a solo career. 
If your knowledge of music doesn’t verge on obsessive you will be an outcast. 
The most awesome and inspiring of dive bars play heavy metal. 
They play it loud and don’t give a fuck about you. 
The metal bar will always allow smoking. 
Self destruction is one of the most metal things a person can do. 
Regardless of the tolerance for smoking, there will always be a huddle of smokers outside the metal bar. 
This is to warn passersby about what lies in store should they walk in the doors. 
The average barfly will be intimidated. 
They will stumble past to a friendly looking crowd. 
But they don’t know these people. 
All they’d have to say is something like, “Danzig rocks.” Or “My life was empty until is started listening to Pantara.” Or, “This one time I was drinking tall cans in a parking lot listening to Slayer…” And they will open up to you. 
They’re people too. 
They just have more tattoos and piercings. 
They own more black leather than you. 
However, just because they may shake your hand doesn’t mean they like you. 
Don’t mistake their tolerance for acceptance. 
That will be the end of your career at the metal bar. 
One slip and they will not hesitate to punch you in the face. 
They are people too. 
People with an edge. 
Every once in a while, there will be a dive bar that has a soundtrack heavy with rhythm and blues. 
With soul and Motown. 
This will be a very relaxed bar. 
Everyone here will be taking it easy, trying to look cool. 
Al Green and Otis Redding will play in the background. 
The sound will not over take your conversations. 
It will be pleasant and allow you to carry on with your business undisturbed. 
The people in the bar won’t notice you much. 
They will be too busy looking at their own reflections or listening to the sound of their own voice. 
Or looking cool rolling their own cigarettes and drinking absinthe. 
 Every once in a while sending text messages to their friends who are doing the same thing at other bars all over the place. 
At the end of the bar balancing quarters, three whiskies deep and sinking rapidly, is Spencer Raleigh. 
 He’s going down a list of whiskey drinks he keeps in his head. 
He starts off with top shelf. 
Make it a perfect Manhattan. 
A perfect Manhattan is equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. 
There’s a maraschino cherry and lots of bourbon. 
It should be shaken until ice cold. 
Little flecks of ice cubes will float the surface of the martini glass that holds it. 
He tried as always to tie the cherry stem with his teeth and tongue. 
Once again he was defeated. 
For the next round he takes a whiskey sour with middle shelf bourbon. 
He squeezed the lemon wedge into his glass and dropped it in with the ice stirring with the straw and taking one long, slow sip. 
He discards the straw for the remainder of the drink, cutting out the middle man. 
The third time around is a tossup. 
It’s either a sidecar, if he’s in the right mood, or a bourbon and ginger with a splash of bitters and a twist of lime. 
He went with the bourbon and ginger. 
His disposition wasn’t the sweetest of things these days. 
His shoulders still sore from digging up two bodies. 
His hands still sore from hauling all the human baggage around. 
His mind still aching from slight paranoia and giddy from clandestine operations. 
For science. 
He drank to science for the third time that night.
In front of him sits two dollars in quarters all on ends spaced equidistant. 
He folds his dollar bills into pyramids, making tip towers to command the attention of the bartender. 
A little trick he picked up from strip clubs. 
The tallest tower wins the lap dance game. 
The tallest tip might win you a free drink if you behave. 
He was determined to establish enough credit in the span of two hours to earn a free shot of Fernet. 
Fernet is by most standards a foul liquor. 
The taste is very herbal and pungent. 
It hits you in the throat and goes down like over steeped tea and burning. 
But after you’ve made your shot taking face. 
After you’ve coughed and felt the burn subside, you’re left with a pleasant afterglow that will carry on for a few minutes. 
Spencer lives for the burn. 
He lives for the rush of the pain and the flow of endorphins. 
The brain over compensating for nonexistent pain. 
The pain in his bladder has caught up to him. 
The time has come to break the seal. 
To let flow the buildup of urine stewing below his belly. 
He ambles up to the restroom and opens the door. 
He steadies himself by the urinal and begins to fidget with his pants. 
Goddamn button fly. 
Common enemy of the drunken man. 
Eventually his fingers do the right thing and he’s overwhelmed with relief. 
His body drains and he rests for a minute. 
The lights in the room seem to brighten slightly as he feels the piss flowing from his penis. 
He begins to notice the smell in here. 
He begins to notice that he’s not alone in the restroom. 
There’s someone sitting in the stall next to him. 
He can hear the breathing patterns of struggle. 
He decided it’s time to button up and go back to his glass.
He washes his hands and takes two paper towels to dry them off. 
 He exits the restroom and returns to his drink. 
His tip tower is gone, but his drink is full again. 
A sign of partial success. 
He might get all the way to shitfaced drunk in no time. 
He’s off to a good start. 
He has twenty dollars left in his drinking budget. 
That should be enough to get where he needs to be. 
He takes a hard gulp of whiskey into his system. 
He feels the warm whiskey glow flowing over his body. 
He smiles a bourbon soaked smile and continues looking at all the bottles.
“Hey bartender, hey excuse me.” He calls over a short girl with shorter black hair that’s perfectly styled. 
Not a single hair out of place. 
She has bright green eyes and the complexion of a doll. 
“Whatcha need?” Her hands are in her pockets, but she’s ready for action. 
Don’t be fooled. 
“That bottle down there, the dusty that looks kinda French.” She motions towards the very bottom shelf with the hardly ever used for anything alcohol. 
“No, not that one, two bottles to the left. 
Yeah, the green one. 
What does that do?”
“I think it gets you drunk.” She says it with a smile, perpetually charmed by the simplicity of the barfly mentality.
“Well, I mean, like. 
What does it taste like? What’s it used for? It looks so neglected down there. 
I’m curious. 
I’m curious about the contents of that little green bottle. 
Tell me more.”
“Well, why don’t we try it?” She has two glasses ready and pours a little more than a sip into each one. 
They clink glasses and touch them to the bar top. 
He says, “For science!”
She says, “Hail Satan!”
And they drink the mystery liquor, trying out a little something off the bottom.
“Wow.” Spence says blinking a lot from the burn and sensation of a new taste. 
“Taste like oranges and ass.”
“Ha! I was thinking bitter lemons, but yeah. 
Oranges and ass works pretty well.”
“What the hell would you do with that? I mean, how would you mix the damn thing?”
“That, that I’d mix with something like soda and more citrus, maybe a little something sweet to knock down that bitterness. 
Want me to try something?” She looks at Spence in eager anticipation. 
At least he’s not a vodka drinker. 
 At least he’s not ordering goddamn mohito. 
At least he doesn’t want me to muddle for him.
“Wait until I finish this one.” He takes a long steady intake of whiskey. 
“Ok, I think we’re ready for it.”
She laughs lightly and begins getting the ingredients into a shaker. 
She tastes with a long straw, plugging her finger over the top and dropping the liquid into her mouth. 
She keeps shaking her head and going to another corner of the bar to fetch another bottle. 
Eventually she seems content. 
She pours the mixture into a rocks glass and slides it over to Spence on a napkin. 
He takes a slow sip from the straw and thinks it over in his mouth. 
He tosses the drink from side to side between his cheeks.
“Not bad. 
Not bad at all. 
This is very drinkable.” He throws the straws away and takes another gulp from the glass. 
He smiles looking down at his drink. 
“Hey, you got a name?”
“Jamie to most folks. 
Jamie Concord.” She extends a hand over the bar top.
“Spencer Raleigh. 
But Spence is just fine with me. 
I’m a big fan of brevity. 
A pleasure to meet you.” Spence extracts a cigarette and lights it. 
As he exhales there’s a bit of dizziness thrown in. 
Time to slow things down a little.
“Hey Jamie… would it be too much to ask for a bit of water?”
“Not at all. 
I’m more than happy to give someone a glass of water.”
“Thanks. 
You pretty good at this bartending business.”
“Well, shit, there ain’t much else to do in this town. 
Drinking seems to pass the time just fine.”
“Tell me about it. 
Say, where’s a good place to eat?”
She laughs a little. 
“When you say good place to eat are we talking like, good food or open late or interesting?”
“Any of the above would suit me just fine.”
“Well, then you’re shit outta luck sir.”
“Damnit. 
Well hows about something edible and close by?”
“How do you feel about hotdogs?”
“Most of the time, pretty good.”
“There’s a hot dog place about two blocks away. 
Just don’t get the chili dog. 
It will sound mighty tasty. 
But don’t believe it. 
Just get a regular hotdog and load it up how you like. 
But no chili. 
The chili will ruin you. 
Tomorrow morning you will be hating life. 
Just take my word for it.”
“Alright. 
That sounds reasonable. 
How late are they open?”
“Oh, I think until midnight. 
Ish. 
Should be fine.”
“What time is it now? I’m kinda drunk.”
“Well you should be! After all I’ve done for you. 
Let’s see, it’s about…” Jamie finds a clock on a distant wall. 
“About, six thirty, give or take.”
“Give or take what?”
“The last time someone bothered to check if the clock was accurate.”
“Hmm. 
This does not bode well. 
I may have to leave.”
“Aw, so soon? You just got here. 
And you’re the best customer I’ve had all night.”
“Sorry lady, business meeting.”
“Business meeting at this hour? While you’re half way to shitfaced?”
“Ha! I’m a little over halfway. 
As soon as I start walking, I expect to be most of the way there. 
I’ll try and stop back again after work is done. 
But I make no promises.”
“Fair enough. 
It’s been nice.”
“Indeed it has. 
Jamie, thanks again. 
Oh, and what do I owe you?”
“Don’t sweat it. 
Just come back soon and we can work something out.”
“You’re an angel of mercy.”
“Aw shucks.” She says shucks in a way that implies many late night Leave It to Beaver marathons. 
She says it with a look that could pacify a lone gunman. 
That would make a bridge jumper reconsider. 
She has a look on her face that could bring about world peace and feed the hungry children of Africa.
Spence closes the door behind him and pulls his coat a little tighter. 
Goddamn NorCal weather. 
He lights another cigarette and walks across the street to the Motel Six Hundred. 
He walks to the lot where his van is parked.
Chapter twelve:
On a couch at the end of the street, in an apartment in between states of disaster and functional mess, Laurel wakes up to the sound of cement saws and hammering. 
She hears voices in Spanish, the screaming of small children and their mothers trying to contain them. 
She cracks her eyes open and smells stale cigarette smoke and tastes stale beer fermenting inside her mouth. 
She looks at the walls and sees deranged doodles and photographs of mohawked madmen dancing at dawn down by the seashore. 
She sighs in a distinctly non-French accent. 
She sighs the hangover sigh that’s not from staying up all night guzzling cheap wine on the patio of some café with overpriced bread and bohemians laying about as they tend to do. 
She sighs and groans and feels her head pound in an empty fashion. 
The mark of another till dawn two case of beer escapade that landed them on a lookout well above the bay, with the sea of lights and the stark darkness of the ocean at night in between. 
The shambles somehow slept right through the saws and the kids and Spanish. 
He snored away, shirtless and short clad, wrapped in a tangle of blanket that did little to conceal his frame. 
Laurel sat up slightly and was instantly overcome by the sour longing in her stomach. 
Jesus, when had she eaten last? She looks at the kitchen and sees a trail of sauce leading to a line of dishes, going into the sink. 
Oh right. 
We ate before passing out. 
I don’t understand how they manage to do this. 
Night after night. 
 Case of beer, bong loads and countless cigarettes until consciousness seems like too much effort and just then someone is cooking breakfast. 
Or is it dinner. 
The sun was almost up but time is only measured as the space in between naps. 
What a strange situation I seem to have landed in. 
I don’t even know what day it is anymore. 
I doubt these guys even care. 
If I asked, they’d just laugh at me again. 
Jesus, Marji. 
Where have you sent me? This is like some kind of parody of a Buddhist monastery. 
Every time I have a question, I’m either laughed at or given some kind of meaningless rambling response that only leaves me kinda confused. 
And where the fuck is my phone call? Where the fuck is my boyfriend? I’ve been here for at least a few days and nothing. 
Not a peep. 
 Not a nothing. 
 I bet he called the house phone. 
Goddamnit.
Laurel has her ache in her hands and keeps closing and unclosing her eyes. 
Opening isn’t really the right word for it. 
They never quite make it to open. 
She decides now is a good time to smoke a joint. 
A good morning marijuana cigarette. 
That always seems to wake the boys up. 
Maybe, she’s thinking, maybe she should make breakfast and try and repay a little hospitality. 
Maybe wash some dishes to get today started on the right foot. 
She decides against waking the boys up with the joint. 
 She’s going to be a little selfish and smoke it outside. 
She opens the door and moves silently into the noonday sun. 
She quickly doubles back for her sunglasses and feels instantly relieved from the sheer brightness of it all. 
The freshness of the air is only in contrast to the mustiness of the room. 
The light of the sun only because she stumbled out of the darkness of inside. 
In a little while she will have adjusted to everything. 
The joint works wonders on her body and mind. 
Feeling so much better with every inhalation.
She perches on a set of concrete steps right about the laundry room. 
She watches the construction workers build two identical staircases at the opening of the apartment complex. 
She finds a spot where the sun isn’t too hard on her just now waking up and coming to terms with today head. 
The headache is just a minor vexation now. 
She’s stoned enough for it not to be a problem anymore. 
Just as she relaxes, a low murmur of a voice interrupts her comfort. 
The voice is something of a permanent slur eminating from a forever clenched jaw. 
The tone is that of an old reel to reel cartoon when the tape catches something and the voices slow down, still fluctuating in wildly animated ways but at half the speed of regular conversation. 
“Heeey.”
Laurel turns to see something of a skeleton standing behind her. 
The bone structure is stark and clearly visible beneath the skin. 
The eyes sunk in their sockets and the cheeks have retreated towards the back of his head. 
His faces makes something of a smile but it comes across like the someone whispering about what smiles used to look like when they were a child, like someone whispering in the next room about a smile they saw once that used to run around the block and dance all night with the prettiest girl in school, but once the smile grew up it was drafted and fought in a war where it lost its legs and came home crippled and living off charity.
The face looks prematurely aged as if it were found by a middle aged housewife at a yard sale, stuck inside a used food dehydrator bought from a late night infomercial when all other options seemed hopeless. 
The eyes are hollow and flat, not even a hint that something is happening behind them. 
They are the kind of green that is found only on winter coats at thrift stores made back in the days before color television when fashion designers came to work reeking of bathtub gin and feeling vindictive. 
They are dull and all the softness is gone from them. 
There are burn marks on his fat lips and he has the kind of teeth you see in dental school text books when they are giving the lessons on why dental care is so important and what will happen to your teeth if you spend half your life smoking drugs in massive quantities. 
A few of his teeth have jumped from the beef jerky ship of his face only to drown in the pools of gut rot discount liquor found in sporadic spots all over the floor of what used to be called an apartment. 
Is probably now called a hazardous material zone. 
Will probably be called in the future, police line do not cross.
Laurel looks up at him like he’s a bad dream taking refuge in the body of a nightmare possessed a legion of devils covered in fading tattoos and bearing the scars of bare fisted street fights. 
It’s much too early in the afternoon for this. 
This is not someone you want to wake up to. 
She just continues staring at him and growing slightly defensive.
“Heeey. 
That a joint yer smokin’?” He mumbles the words out of his mouth like the caricature of a man with one hand jumping across a river on the rocks with a pogo stick with a broken spring. 
The dead spring clashes around inside uselessly and the rocks are slippery with algae.
“No, no it’s not.” She can’t even utilize the smart ass response mechanism in her brain. 
She’s stunned into flat out lying.
“Sure smells like ah joint. 
A heeuhhee a heeuhhee.” The laugh escapes desperately in a low rumbling fumble of feeble amiability finishing with the kind of wheezing mostly heard in hospital wings where the nurses wheel the old people off to die.
“Well, sorry to disappoint you.” Laurel shifts uncomfortably but not at all sorry, taking in his much too shiny shoes and his ball cap emblazoned with the words ‘I’m the Boss’. 
 His sleeveless black shirt and black jeans. 
He scratches his neck and twists his face into something in between a snarl and his handicapped smile.
“Weeell. 
Oh kay. 
Byee.” With that he staggers with hands in pockets to a door across the way and knocks. 
He walks in and closes the door behind him. 
Laurel snubs out the rest of the joint and walks back inside the apartment. 
The shambles is propped up in bed, smoking a cigarette and blinking; jarred by the opening of the door and the burst of sunlight from outside.
“Where’ve you been? It’s too early for anything.” He taps the ash into a tray and takes another drag.
“I was sitting on the steps outside and saw the most tragic thing.”
“Oh, you met The Moth.” The shambles giggles to himself.
“The Moth? Is that what you call something like that? How’d he get that name?”
“Oh, he used to live in this apartment. 
He’d come over any time we had the kitchen light on. 
He’s the living embodiment of tragedy. 
You should hear his stories. 
That’ll make you thankful for everything that’s ever happened to you. 
He’s a walking testament to just how tragic life could have been for any of us.”
“Fucking hell. 
I don’t want to listen to his stories. 
I don’t want to hear that voice ever again. 
What’s his problem anyway?”
“Oh, he’s just a crackhead with an apartment. 
Living off his families charity and playing the drums, somehow.”
“That’s enough. 
That solves the mystery. 
I don’t want to know anymore. 
That works for me.”
“Suit yourself. 
He’s a character. 
 You’ll run into him again the longer you stay here.”
“I really don’t want to do that. 
He scares me.”
“He’s harmless. 
I think. 
At least he’s never done anything that seemed harmful. 
At least not to anyone except himself.” The shambles puts the butt in the ashtray, pushing it down until it has been snuffed.
“After that, after that I think I  eed a shower.”
“That’s typical. 
Suit yourself, she’s all yours.”
In the bathroom, all alone with the ashtray and the mirror, Laurel undresses. 
She turns on the water and waits until everything is just right, when the water is a comforting warmth. 
She slips in the stream and feels a wave of water wash over her thirsty skin. 
She lets her hair get wet to the scalp, rinses off the sweat and grim and dead skin from her body and stand in the water for a while, looking out the window.
She turns the faucet off and takes a towel off the rack and dries herself thoroughly. 
 In the mirror she combs her hair out from the tangles from her shoulder length brunette hair. 
 When she was a younger woman she went through a phase so common these days of changing her hair color and trying various ways of changing her look. 
Of resetting all the details to seem like a different person every so often. 
Now she’s let it grow out to the hair she was born with. 
A nice natural brown like freshly polished oak furniture. 
In the mirror she takes a good look at her face. 
Her hazel eyes are still there, a little bloodshot from the joint, but still somewhere in between brown and green. 
Some days they were a little greener or a bit more brown. 
 Today they seems balanced, right in the middle. 
Greener in the middle and extending outward to brown edges. 
She always thought her nose was a little too small for her face. 
Roscoe said it was a cute nose that seemed to shy away from the rest of her face. 
Her lips were not over bearing, they didn’t jut out and were not too thin. 
Her face was not exactly perfect symmetry. 
But it was close enough for no one notice. 
And for the most part, she didn’t care. 
Laurel puts on her clothes and brushes her hair, brushes her teeth and does her best to look presentable. 
She makes some effort to look like she hasn’t been holed up in hiding for the last few days. 
 She plans on hitting the town. 
She plans on going out and looking around. 
She has so many plans. 
It’s going to be a shame. 
But she doesn’t know that yet. 
She has yet to discover that plans always fail. 
She would be better off setting goals. 
Goals can always be reached regardless of how they come about. 
But plans are too specific. 
Plans always get broken. 
Plans don’t plan for all the roadblocks life throws in the way. 
Plans are not too accommodating for shit hitting the fan. 
The best laid plans. 
Something along those lines.
Fully clothed and groomed and smelling less like she lives on a couch, less like she’s been trapped in a room full of cigarette smoke and tweedle dee and tweedle dumbass and their madcap philosophical existential nonsense. 
She does her best to rise above her circumstances. 
She tries so hard to be something more than what she is. 
To give the appearance of being greater than the sum of her parts.
Back in the living room and the Shambles has a shirt on. 
He noodles on what should be a broken guitar. 
The guitar has made it a long way. 
Right now it’s held together by little more than five layers of paint and all the love in the world. 
It has been repaired so many times now that the instrument is a patch work of resourcefulness. 
The bridge came from a piece of material, origin unknown, that had six slots carved in for the strings. 
There’s a built in pick on the side held to the guitar by an excess string. 
The Shambles plucks away and cares for little else right now.
“You hungry?” Laurel asks, stepping into the kitchen.
“Perpetually.” The Shambles says and keeps on fingering out a melody of little to no consequence.
“Excellent. 
Good.” Laurel rolls up her sleeves and looks at the kitchen like battle ground. 
She has a boyfriend, she used to do this. 
But right now she feels like a caretaker. 
She’s wondering how did these guys survive without her. 
How much they’ll miss her when she’s gone. 
She scrubs away at crusty pots and pans. 
She washes the only four plates in the house. 
The only three forks and two spoons. 
These crazy guys living with the bare necessities. 
Just enough to get by and damn if we ever have real company. 
They can bring their own spoon to the party. 
They should know better. 
Laurel washes the dishes and wonders about these things. 
She wonders about her phone call and Roscoe sitting in some terrible police interrogation room. 
She wonders if police interrogation is anything like the movies or cop dramas on the television. 
She hopes it’s not so bad. 
The poor bastard. 
Jesus, what a buzz kill. 
Laurel dries the plates and silverware. 
She dries off the pots and pans and open the fridge to find something worth cooking.
Inside the fridge does little for Laurel. 
There are condiments such as catsup, ranch dressing. 
Italian vinaigrette and spicy mustard. 
There are fifteen varieties of hot sauce. 
There are fifteen little red bottles of capsicum extract. 
She blinks a few times, slightly stunned. 
Holy shit. 
That’s a lot of heat. 
She peaks her head around the corner at the Shambles, strumming away to another place and time.
“Fuckin’ A, you boys like it hot.”
“Oh, yeah. 
Yeah, we do.” He plucks away, unconcerned. 
 Concentrating solely on the idea in his head for a song. 
The song might be about a girl. 
 The lyrics would be about how his baby is gone. 
Now, when we say baby, we’re not referring to an infant. 
When we say baby we’re using it as a term of endearment. 
As a little way of saying, “I’m taking care of you, because you are a helpless little baby. 
There is  o way you could survive without me. 
I am your guardian.”  That’s how we say “baby” in this day and age.
Laurel keeps looking for things that can be cooked. 
There’s a head of cabbage. 
There’s a head of cabbage. 
There’s a head of cabbage. 
Goddamnit. 
The above poem is called, the contents of our fridge. 
It is for sale.
Laurel wrinkles her nose and looks for dry goods. 
A bag of spaghetti. 
Some ramen noodles. 
Bag of rice. 
Goddamn monastics. 
A Mess walks into the room.
“That motherfucker is at it again.” He groans, walking into the kitchen. 
Scratching and stretching and cracking his way to the coffee pot. 
He pours himself a cup of coffee and takes it into the bathroom. 
“That fucking bouncy ball madman upstairs.” He closes the door, lighting a cigarette.
Laurel looks at the Shambles slightly confused.
“He’s convinced there’s a man living upstairs that throws rubber balls around at certain times of the night. 
He says that’s what it sounds like. 
That’s the only way to describe that sound. 
But it might be drops of water coming from different directions splashing in patterns simultaneously. 
Don’t worry about it. 
What’s for breakfast?”
“Cabbage? And ranch dressing? This is terrible. 
We can’t eat this. 
I’m going shopping.” Laurel leaves the house and closes the door.
Laurel walks through the parking lot and pats the Chev on its back. 
You can rest up, old boy. 
I’ll do some walking. 
She passes through the black gate and makes a left. 
On the sidewalk through intermittent trees. 
Up the street along the concrete and right until she sees a light. 
Then another left. 
Laurel ambles down the street adjusting to the sun again. 
She walks past all the parked cars and shuffles along with dead leaves by her feet. 
She kicks the debris and swings her arms at her sides.
Up ahead she sees a the outline of a tent or two. 
That means it’s Tuesday. 
 That means she’s in luck. 
That means it’s farmer’s market day. 
That means she can get in touch with a few people. 
She enters on the west side past the man selling issues of Street Spirit. 
He say he’s giving them away but he asks for a donation of at least a dollar. 
He’s  ot terribly obnoxious about it. 
But still, the paper is hardly ever worth reading. 
A charity case for a charity paper. 
Nothing too special. 
There’s a woman selling freshly baked breads and pastas. 
She has long brown baguettes with beautiful diagonal cuts on top. 
There are loaves of sourdough and bags of this morning cut fettuccini. 
Bags of around sunrise rolled out paperdelle. 
 The woman stands behind her wares and smiles at Laurel as she passes.
There’s a stand with fall fruits. 
Ripe apple and pomegranates. 
Persimmons and the last couple crops of figs. 
A farmer selling squashes in all matter of sizes. 
Butternuts and pumpkins, acorns and blue ballets. 
The market smells like earth and someone cooking breakfast burritos. 
There’s a man playing slide guitar with his case open on the ground for people to drop loose change in. 
Hopefully, the occasional dollar bill. 
He plays upright with the slide on his little finger. 
Laurel passes by the small farms, each one with a decent crop to sell. 
The people manning the booths are mostly morning in their twenties. 
These are earthy people, always close to the soil. 
Their skin is brown from spending most of the summer in the sun, digging and planting. 
Harvesting and weeding. 
Each one commited to a new ideal of old methods, pure food. 
Sustainability is a word used often around here. 
The ideal of using everything you can. 
Everything at your disposal to the fullest capacity. 
The idea is not to waste anything. 
It makes sense. 
This is the backlash to decades of careless consumerism. 
This is in retaliation to people pumping all our foodstuffs with chemicals to make them last longer, stand up to unfamiliar weather, resist pests. 
This is the culmination of years of research into the science of food and farming. 
That we’re better off using nature to our advantage instead of trying to take advantage of  ature. 
Go figure. 
“Oh there you are! Hey Laurel!” A voice calls to Laurel from behind a booth. 
A head sticks up with a ball cap and pair of sunglasses big enough to conceal the top half of her head. 
She waves enthusiastically and Laurel smiles, heading toward her. 
“Hey Nancy, what’s up?”
“Where have you been? Everyone’s been wondering what happened. 
I’ve been calling you for fucking days, Joe’s worried sick, I think Tia was about to start putting your face on milk cartons.”
“Really? How long have I been gone?”
“Like, a week and a half.”
“Seriously?”
“Seriously.”
“Jesus.”
“Yeah, you should really get your phone turned back on.”
“My phone’s been out?!”
“Yeah dude, for days.”
“Fucking shit!” Laurel is surprised by the loudness of her voice and looks around. 
Almost everyone knows her here, at least by sight.
“Yeah, exactly. 
Fix it. 
I think Joe’s over at Blue Heron’s booth. 
You should talk to him. 
Now.”
“Ok. 
Yeah. 
Good idea.”
“Oh, but first, where the hell have you been? What’s going on? This isn’t like you at all.”
“Long story. 
Basically, Roscoe was arrested a few days ago and I’ve been in hiding.”
“Oh shit.”
“Yeah, pretty much.”
“Well, go tell Joe. 
You guys work something out. 
I’m sorry to hear that. 
Come back later, you should see the last batch of dry farms. 
They’re beautiful and looks like we’ll only have them for one more week.”
“Ok, I will. 
Later Nancy.” Laurel waves and walks through the crowd a few booths down. 
The other farmers nod and smile at her, some wave. 
She waves back and walks like she’s on a mission. 
She sees the booth up ahead and a very tall man is standing with his back towards her. 
She does that thing people do before they have to talk to a boss. 
She stops, regroups a little. 
Takes a deep breath and does her best to look presentable.
“Hi Joe.” She says.
Joe turns around at the sound of her voice. 
“And where the hell have you been? Is everything okay?”
“Everything is not ok, no. 
I wouldn’t say things are ok at all. 
 I would say things are not so good. 
Very bad even. 
I’m hiding out from the police, Joe. 
I’m hiding from the police because my boyfriend was busted and the house may have been raided by now and I have no idea what’s going on. 
I just found out my phone’s been dead for days. 
 I’m living on the couch of two crazy hippies that stay up all  ight getting drunk and playing music and drawing on the walls and cooking everything with cheese and hot sauce and”
“Ok. 
Wow, okay. 
I get the point. 
Shit hit the fan. 
Shit happened all over your fan. 
I’m sorry to hear that. 
How much time are you going to need off? I mean, it’s not terribly busy, I think we can afford to give you a vacation. 
Yeah, a little vacation time is about due for you anyway. 
You know if it was anyone else they’d be fired. 
Anyone else.”
“Thanks Joe. 
But really, I have no idea how long I’m going to need. 
I just found out about my fucking phone and I really need to get that turned back on. 
But I can call you. 
I will call you and let you know. 
Like I probably should have when this all happened. 
But it happened so fast and then there I was at that apartment and I must have been on a bender for days. 
And goddamn I’m so hungry.”
“Alright, hey don’t worry about it. 
Have Nancy hook you up on credit. 
We’ll take care of you, as long as you stay in touch.”
“Thanks, thanks again. 
I’ll be back later. 
I really need to get my phone back on. 
Roscoe might have called and I really need to know what’s going on.”
“Alright, fine. 
Be that way. 
Be a slave to your phone. 
You’re such a materialist.” Joes gives her a look that says just kidding. 
He gives her a look that says relax, you should probably go surfing. 
That’s what I’d do. 
I’d go surfing. 
That sounds like fun.
“I’ll see you later, Joe. 
Take care.”
“You take care. 
I’m going take what I can get.”
Laurel leaves the market and walks up Derby St towards Shattuck. 
She walks along with the fall colors and the traffic lights and crosses about eight streets before she turns up Dwight. 
Past rows of houses and apartment complexes, flats and all the trees that were allowed to grow in between. 
She walks along the sidewalk humming half singing to herself and trying not so much to think about the fact that her phone has been dead for a few days and who knows what she’s missed. 
Roscoe could have called. 
Marji could have called. 
Her employers certainly did call. 
That’s all she knew. 
She wished she had brought the Chev along. 
All of this would have been so easy if the Chev were here to help out.
Dwight runs right into Telegraph. 
 Right up a small incline and there you are. 
All the sights and smells of a small city section of urban sprawl. 
All the action of a few long blocks. 
Students meandering and walking around, catching up with friend and running into acquaintances. 
Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee. 
The students with their college sweaters and backpacks, book bags and on occasion, rolling luggage for all those overpriced paper-weighted text books. 
All the students cramming nineteen units a semester barely getting enough sleep to survive living on loans and cheap food and the every once in a while care package from mom and dad. 
The students are not really locals. 
Some like to pretend that they are. 
But they’re not from around here. 
Their existence is only temporary. 
A fleeting moment in the life span of a college town. 
They come, they go. 
Some end up sticking around, but not nearly all of them. 
There’s just not enough room. 
Things are crowded enough as it is. 
If college students never left their college town it would be akin to an overpopulation problem brought about by some jackass discovering the secret to immortality and selling the result at discount drug stores for $4.99 available behind the counter. 
People need to die and college students need to leave after graduation. 
It’s only fair to the rest of us.
The bums are out enjoying the weather. 
There are more cup rattlers out today than is typical. 
They sit offering nothing in exchange for other people’s pity and spare coins. 
They have run out of talent or steam or drive and instead sit all day long on the sidewalk, using only enough energy to shake a paper cup at you when you walk by. 
Most of them are missing more than one tooth. 
All of them bum cigarettes of any likely looking candidate. 
The cup rattlers make up a rhythm section from the sound of desperation. 
The drum beat of an empty belly played on by broken fingers.
The runaways are all over the place. 
Kids that spend their time since leaving home or dropping out or just getting on a bus one day and never looking back. 
Kids that spend their free time sitting around trying to find a way to eat. 
These kids at least have some drive. 
They’re not yet broken people with nothing to offer society. 
Some of them can play the guitar. 
Others can play hand drums. 
Some of them make signs from scrap cardboard and try to come up with witty slogans in order to elicit funds from passersby. 
Sometimes their efforts work fairly well. 
But none of them are going to retire anytime soon. 
None of them are doing much in the way of moving on. 
More like moving from place to place. 
More like the same scene in every city, everywhere you go. 
Only the scenery changes slightly. 
A black cat begins to cross Laurel’s path. 
He seems a little less than stray, meaning he seems fat enough not to be in need. 
 She bends at the knees and reaches towards the cat’s head. 
He sniffs her hand with cautious optimism. 
Ready to accept and ready to dodge depending on what the hand does. 
Depending on how the hand smells. 
Laurel reaches down and starts petting the cat’s head. 
He gives in greedily, turning into the pressure and purring with reckless abandon. 
He twists his hold body against the pressure of Laurel’s scratch and ends up rolled over on his back, belly exposed and ready for more. 
 Taking a tip, Laurel goes in for the belly rub. 
He accepts at first and then goes into a playful mood. 
He seizes her hand between his mouth and four paws. 
He kicks at her with his hind legs and leaves a deep scratch on her hand from his teeth.
“You little fucker. 
Let go.” She smacks the black cat on the head and shoos him away.
Laurel looks at her hand and sees red lines crossing all over the place. 
“That little bastard.” 
If you see a cat on the sidewalk and stop to give the animal a little love. 
If you stop what you’re doing as an act of kindness, you will only end up bleeding. 
If you ever try to kill someone with kindness, the only person ending up dead will be you. 
And you might have rabies.
The shop where she needs to go to turn her phone back on is about three block ahead and up to the right for three more blocks. 
That’s not too far. 
She can walk that in about five minutes or less. 
The distance is of little to no consequence. 
 The concrete will feel the same underfoot. 
She stands erect, rubbing her torn hand and continues walking. 
She passes a noodle shop and a few clothing stores. 
She passes a booth where in man with wild head gear listens to Neil Young and sells patches for people to sew onto various items, proclaiming to the world their love of music by The Beatles or the degree and extent for which they loath the government. 
This guy might have landed here in the late sixties or early seventies. 
He has probably been selling the same set of patches for some thirty years. 
He just might be a holdover from another era. 
He sings along to the music and doesn’t seem to care about anything else.
The phone store is up ahead and Laurel walks up the the glass windows, looking inside. 
She passes through a doorway and walks up to a person standing behind the counter labeled for the service of customers. 
The man on the other side doesn’t react in any way. 
He looks at her approaching. 
He’s quite certain he won’t have to help her. 
He’s pretty sure there’s an automated touch screen device in the corner that can do everything she needs to get down. 
He’d rather not help her. 
He will get the same paycheck regardless. 
“My phone’s been turn off and I’d like to turn it back on.”
“When’s the last time you paid your phone bill?”
“Umm. 
I’m not exactly sure… But it couldn’t have been that long ago.”
“Right behind you, to your left, is a machine for paying bills. 
Check that first and if something still isn’t working, let me know. 
I’d be more than happy to help.” He puts on a smile only suitable at customer service counters. 
If that smile were anywhere else, someone would punch that smile right in the face. 
It’s the most punchable smile you will ever see. 
The machine in the corner is behaving like things do when put into corners. 
It hunches over, slightly slow and depressed because it has been segregated from the rest of the store. 
No one wants to deal with the machine. 
Everyone prefers being able to negotiate with a live human being. 
The bill paying machine stands in the corner with a dunce cap of rejection, full of self pity and bearing nothing close to good news for anyone. 
The machine has a slot to accept money but there’s no place to dispense any. 
The machine is a taker. 
The only thing you will get out of this machine is a receipt. 
A paper record of every cent the damn thing took from you.
Laurel pushes the picture of a button, prompting the program in the machine to take her money. 
She gives the machine her information. 
She tells the machine her address, her phone number, the last four digits of her social security  umber. 
She gives the machine her credit card. 
She types in more numbers and presses the pictures of more buttons. 
The machine gives her a receipt. 
The reciept lists all the money it has taken from her and lists all the money Laurel, until now, owed the machine. 
The receipt is only a reminder of how much money has gone into the machine. 
And how much money the machine will expect next month. 
The receipt is a very depressing piece of paper.
Laurel pays her bill and looks at her phone expectantly. 
She expects instant gratification. 
Instant gratification is a concept only actualized until recently. 
There’s still a few kinks to work out of the system. 
Our best men are on the job. 
Don’t worry about it. 
By the time you wake up tomorrow morning, instant gratification will be ready for you. 
It will always have to wait until tomorrow morning. 
And it will always be today.
Laurel’s phone looks at nothing because it doesn’t have eyes or the required controlling devices that enable seeing through eyes. 
There is only a screen. 
All the screen has to offer right now is the current time. 
Laurel might as well wear a wrist watch. 
She eyes the man behind the counter and scowls. 
Her eyes do their best to communicate spite. 
She tries her hardest to stare straight into his soul and destroy it. 
When her eyes make it that far she realizes there’s  o soul left to destroy. 
She finds only the abandoned building blocks of a man. 
No one even bothered to put up a for sale sign.
She turns around and marches back out of the building. 
She walks back to the sidewalk and looks around her. 
There’s a hotdog place just up the street. 
A hot dog doesn’t sound so bad right now. 
A hot dog or two might calm her nerves a bit. 
She walks up the place that doesn’t have a space to sit. 
Just a window to order and a menu with several kinds of sausages. 
She decides on a bratwurst and kielbasa. 
 She waits and looks around the shop. 
On the walls are  ewspaper articles, clippings and art all of an anarchist edge. 
All of them anti-authoritarian and anti-government. 
An anarchist hotdog stand. 
How quaint, she thinks. 
Her phone buzzes to life in her pocket. 
She has three new messages.
Chapter thirteen;
Reverend Carmichael stands behind the pulpit. 
The time has come. 
The arrival of the time for which he has prepared his sermon is right now. 
He looks out at the congregation. 
The rows of pews of people sitting with various levels of attention and varying lengths of attention span. 
You’d think you’d be able to correlate the lengths of the attention span to the ages of the individuals that possessed them. 
You’d think this would make a nice bell curve if graphed out. 
But you’d be wrong. 
There is no concrete relationship between age and attention span. 
The root of the attention span lies solely in the personal force and discipline of the person. 
There is  o way around this. 
The good reverend looks at his flock and tries not to concentrate on any of them. 
Treat them like a herd. 
Don’t get too involved. 
If he were not here to guide them, surely they would all find themselves wandering into traffic or over cliffs or ending up under bridges drinking wine from bottles concealed poorly in paper bags with their best friends. 
Their best friends would be dope addicts and prostitutes. 
The Reverend shudders and looks down at his notes. 
“I’m sure that some of you still watch the news. 
I’m sure that there’s a group of you that gossip about the goings on in the world, and the world around you and matters relating to the church and thinking all the time that the end is  ear and we are all in grave danger. 
That the Antichrist walks amongst us even now. 
I’m sure that in this very parish there are a few of you that walk the streets with smug expressions thinking that you are saved and when the day finally comes, you will be whisked to Heaven to sit at the right hand of Christ and bask in his holy glory. 
“I have been watching the news for the last few days. 
The watching has caused me grief and pains for these times that we live in. 
I’m sure some of you have heard of the burnings. 
For those of you that haven’t heard, allow me to summarize. 
“Starting in the panhandle of Texas sometime last year, there were a series of churches burned to the ground. 
All of them along the major highways. 
The police reports attributed the fires to faulty wiring. 
To years of neglected electrical work that was bound to fail at some point. 
However, now, in the light of repetition and too many instances to ignore, we know this to be the work of a group of people. 
A group of people that are at war with God.
“The fires started in Texas and continued west along the highways, through New Mexico and Arizona, to Southern California and recently have started spreading north.” A murmur rises from the pews. 
The people relay information from relatives from the areas. 
Spreading loose information garnered from speculation on behalf of a few local newspapers. 
The people in the pews accept this information as pure fact.
“I know what many of you might be thinking. 
I know this is frightening news and the possibility of this very church, this very house of God being targeted by these devil worshipers is very real. 
This is a good parish, and you are all good citizens. 
They have every reason to hate you and what you stand for. 
You are the backbone of this community. 
 Our charity work has saved lives and brought countless people back on their feet. 
We’ve feed and clothed the poor, tended to the sick and needy. 
Our report card is near flawless. 
And this makes the Satanists very angry. 
It’s not a matter of pride. 
 I feel that we, as a community, see this as the way things ought to be. 
We’re just doing as we should and it’s nothing special. 
We’re just trying to be decent people and give and serve as Christ intended. 
But there are always enemies. 
There is always an opposition. 
“Satan works in powerful, evil ways on the minds of the weak. 
He instills ideas of harm and hate and violence on those that have not guarded themselves from the attacks of the Morning Star. 
I’m not saying we should live in fear, and neither am I saying we should walk with arrogance that we are immune to the charms of the Great Deceiver. 
The Father of lies has his agents everywhere. 
And we must be on our guard.” More murmuring encircles the congregation.
“These poor, terrible people that haven’t accepted Christ in their lives. 
This is what happens when people are careless with their minds!  This is what happens, when we let our children grow up, sparing them the rod, sparing them common sense, sparing them the concept of consequences. 
“In school they are taught that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. 
That everything you do will come back to you. 
It’s only a matter of time. 
Brothers and Sisters, we live in a time of fear. 
We live in an age where we have become so comfortable. 
We have become so lazy in our certainty, so full of pride in ourselves and how powerful man has become. 
We have become like this because we have forgotten about God. 
We have forgotten to give credit to the Most High, the only person to whom credit is due. 
We have forgotten that we are nothing except God’s children.
“Brothers and Sisters. 
When you go home today. 
When you are having dinner with your family. 
Be grateful. 
Give thanks to God for their company, their lives, their existence. 
 Pray to God that he might deliver us from the Satanists. 
Pray that the Satanists find their way, pray they are not lost forever. 
Pray that they see the light.”
Chapter fourteen:
Spencer see’s the light coming from the sign of the Motel Six Hundred. 
He finds room sixty-six and knocks five times. 
Five knocks resonate from the other side of the door. 
Spencer knocks twice and is answered twice. 
Spencer knocks three more times and the door opens.
“The last three knocks on my side are totally unnecessary. 
I don’t know who thought that up. 
It’s obviously you and I’m obviously me, and I see no reason whatsoever for any formalities beyond just enough for security purposes and basic verification. 
Besides, I do have little porthole, I could see you before I opened up. 
But still. 
 You could have been someone disguised just like you. 
 Maybe someone stole your face. 
It’s possible. 
One of the guys on the team knows a guy who knows a guy. 
One of those things.” The man behind the door stands blinking into the parking lot. 
“Jesus Christ, Spence. 
How much whiskey did you drink before you got here?”
“Jusst Enough.” He made sure Enough was capitalized. 
That’s exactly how he said it. 
And he said it while allowing himself into the motel room. 
He sat on the arm chair provided courteously by the Motel Six Hundred. 
He sat on it as if he owned it.
“Well, if you’re drunk, you’re drunk and I certainly can’t change that. 
No matter. 
It’s not a big deal. 
If you want to do business with a head full of whiskey and a van full of stiffs, that’s not my problem. 
How are they? Are they still fresh?”
“They are cold and they are dead and there’s twoo of them.” Spencer holds up two fingers to emphasis his ability to count corpses. 
 He smiles at the man, still standing by the door, now closed. 
Now behind which the man that opened comes into view. 
He stands taller than he looks. 
Probably because he has excellent posture. 
He’s not the type of person that slouches often and when he catches himself in a slouch, he’s sure to straight that up right away, as if he lingered any longer in such a position the swift disciplinary action of an authority figure would send nothing but pain into his nervous system. 
The man straightens his posture as if flinching. 
A sudden jerking whole body motion into a militariesque stance. 
 His face is mostly beard. 
The beard takes up most of the real estate from the ears to his chin. 
There’s a small hill of a  ose arising out of the bushes. 
His mouth looks more like a cave strung with creeper vines and moss overgrowth. 
The hair from his head and the hair from his beard mingle together and make braids, make knots, mingle and tangle and turn into a cohesive whole composed of many parts. 
His eyes would be called piercing in a less inspired description. 
 No one was ever aware of his eyebrows. 
He would be called lanky by most people. 
And by most people, we’re talking about the people that wouldn’t call him hairy. 
A very small percentage of people. 
His voiced betrayed the subtlest hint of an accent. 
A holdover from moving around a lot as a child. 
Of being in either Seattle with his father or British Columbia with his mother. 
He no longer notices when he slips in and out of certain dialects that would ordinarily distinguish him from other people. 
“Well then shit, what’s left to do? It’s not like we have paperwork or anything.” The tall, hairy man looks at Spence who sits, giggling on his chair. 
“I suppose you just want some money to get a little drunker?”
Spence looks up when he says money. 
“Filthy fuckin’ bank notes. 
Necessary filth! God! Jesus motherfucking Christ. 
Money.”
“You know that when you say it like that it’s offensive in at least three ways? You’re blaspheming Jesus, the holy virgin, and implying an incestuous relationship between the two. 
Calling Jesus a motherfucker is pretty high up there. 
That’s some deep rooted blasphemy you got going on. 
Good job.”
Spencer laughs a little louder at this. 
“You have no idea. 
I should tell you about my hobby sometime. 
Some other time when you have beer to offer me.”
“Well, I’m not much for the drink, as we tend to be. 
Keeps the brain slow and stupid. 
Keeps the motivation stifled.”
“Well, that’s you guys and this is me. 
Whiskey soaked and smiling away. 
Will those two get me enough gas money to make it to L.A. 
and back in time for the holidays?” 
“Oh, I think you should have plenty. 
Depending on much you end up spending on booze and whatever other drugs you  eed to get through the day. 
Or you know, whores, whatever. 
Whatever makes you happy. 
Not my problem. 
You should have more than enough for these two. 
Going to gather a few more from down south, make the rounds back up and get a few more? We appreciate all you’ve done for us, really. 
I’m  ot going to say we couldn’t have done it without you, but you’re doing wonderful work. 
Really. 
You’re helping a lot of people. 
We’re all very grateful for your work. 
You’ve helped save quite a few lives.”
Spencer begins laughing a little in his chair. 
“Yessir. 
I dig ‘em, you heal ‘em. 
That’s the deal. 
He he hee.” Spencer shifts in the chair, being not quite drunk enough to be comfortable anywhere. 
“How the hell have you guys managed to do this anyway? Seems like if someone was able to cure cancer than it would be a big deal. 
The  ews would be all over the story. 
Nations would be clamoring and so on.”
“Well… I’m not really at liberty to discuss the actual method. 
I will say that it’s a kind of old science meets new science meets heavy experimentation and a few very stoned revelations. 
All that matters is that it works. 
All that matters is that we have results and people the scans prove the cancer is gone and hasn’t come back in any of the test subjects. 
The method is functional. 
Although a bit macabre.”
“Well yeah. 
I mean, corpses n’ shit. 
That’s about as macabre as it gets. 
That’s some pretty morbid shit. 
I mean, really. 
Not that I mind. 
I mean, not that it’s really a problem. 
I wasn’t quite expecting this when I answered the ad, but hey. 
Life is full of surprises. 
Know what I mean?”
“All too well. 
All too well.” They sit in the motel room like it’s someone else’s turn to make a move. 
Spence gets that feeling that maybe he’s overstayed his welcome. 
Maybe he’s just drunk and around an all too sober person. 
Maybe that bartender was pretty cute. 
And maybe he could really use a hotdog or three and then more drinks.
“Well then. 
Let’s do some transferring. 
Let’s unload the stiffs and exchange values and be on our ways. 
I’m so fuckin’ hungry.” Spence belches quietly to himself.
“Very well. 
We’ve dawdled long enough. 
Let’s to the parking lot. 
 Get this over with.” The tree of a man opens the door again, waiting for Spencer to get on both feet in such a way that suggests the slightest hint of stability. 
This takes a few moments.
“Oh there I am.” He says with pride, achieving balance.
They walk into the lights of the parking lot and the motel sign and find their respective vehicles. 
Spence unlocks the back doors and looks around for signs of trouble and authority and any hint that their little operation will be noticed. 
Hauling bodies from one van to another in the early evening can be a tricky business. 
The Tree backs his van up near the rear of Spencer’s, making the distance between the two just enough to haul the bodies. 
Both sets of doors open and they help each other with the corpses, passing them along. 
Just shipping some goods over national borders. 
Nothing out of the ordinary. 
Business as usual.
“Excellent. 
They hardly even smell.” The lanky tree headed man takes out what looks like a cigarette and lights it, looking up at the sky and blowing a thick cloud of white smoke heavenward. 
“Long ass drive tonight, and I really do need to get started. 
It’s been a pleasure. 
Thanks again, Spence. 
And have your guy call our guy when you get a few more. 
Business is picking up a little. 
We’re going to need, maybe four, five more within the next month if you can manage.” He hands Spencer two thousand dollars in twenties, rolled into five hundred dollar wads.
“Oohwee. 
That’s some cash right there.” Spence is coming out of nearly cross eyed and looking at the cash in hand. 
“Yeah, L.A. 
and back no problem. 
Thanks ah, I didn’t get your name man.”
“You really don’t need it. 
Maybe we’ll meet again, maybe it will be someone else  ext time. 
If you really need a frame of reference, call me Ross.”
“Ok. 
That works for me. 
Since you know my name and all, figures I should have something to call you. 
Or refer to you by in passing. 
I can’t exactly say ‘the strange Canadian with the bushy face and lanky frame.”
“That’d probably get you further than Ross if you ever need to relate this experience.”
“Fine. 
Be that way.”
“Oh, I will. 
That’s a more or less constant.”
“So, not really constant at all, is that what you’re trying to say?”
“I’m not trying to say anything. 
I’m just saying it. 
There’s really no trying at all.”
“You have a point. 
I think. 
That works for me.”
“You know Spence, I don’t know why you’re helping us. 
I really don’t. 
 And maybe I shouldn’t care. 
Maybe that’s really none of my business. 
But I’m sure you have your reasons. 
Maybe you just like grave robbing. 
Maybe you like the thrill of it all. 
Maybe you’re just a criminal and a drunk and you have nothing better to do. 
I don’t know. 
And I’m not so sure that I really care. 
But you should really think about what you’re doing and why. 
For all you know, I’m a necrophiliac. 
For all you know I’m just a pervert with a fat pocket book and I’m going to take these two dead bodies back to a room somewhere or park my van on the side of the road and fuck the cold shit out of them. 
I might be a Satanist and could be performing rituals that would bring about the Apocalypse. 
Have you ever considered that? That maybe this whole cancer research line is just a put on? That you might just be bringing about the end of the world? Or the end of days? Or just ushering a new era for humanity?”
Spencer looks at him sideways. 
Not exactly from the side, or tilting his head sideways. 
More like cockeyed, or that look that says, ‘Mister, you sure did just talk a lot. 
And I really don’t know exactly what you just said, but it sounded like a lot of information. 
That sounded like some heavy shit you just laid on me. 
And I really don’t know what to do with that. 
So I’m just going to say,’ “Man. 
How much does that really matter? I’ve got two grand in my pocket right now. 
I pay gas money instead of rent. 
And if everything works out, I’m about to turn most of this in three or four grand more. 
Because I can. 
What you do with those bodies is your business. 
I couldn’t care less.”
Instead of all that, Spencer just says, “I can dig.” And he nods solemnly.
“Suit yourself.”
“Oh, I do. 
I do.”  And with that, Spencer waves goodbye over his shoulder, walking away from the parking lot and The Motel Six Hundred. 
 Walking across the street and feeling the desire for another drink after all that talking. 
Another drink and then think about those hot dogs or maybe someone will deliver to the bar. 
That sounds reasonable.
Ross smokes his joint and watches him leave. 
He leans on his van and watches a self contained unit with hardly a care in the world make his way back to the bar for more poison and more. 
Just more. 
Because there’s never enough of anything for him. 
He will always be content and never be satisfied. 
 Ross gets in the van and starts the engine. 
He pulls out of the parking lot and points the vehicles north. 
For science.
Chapter Fifteen:
The ranch house maintained. 
The ranch house survived. 
There was a carbon copy of the floor plan across the street and slight variations all over the neighborhood. 
It was a typical suburban landscape. 
Everyone with fences. 
Everyone with a small front yard and small back yard. 
Tiled kitchen counters and linoleum kitchen floors. 
Inoffensive carpet with the occasionally offensive stain. 
Brick porches. 
Slate rock patios. 
Lawns and lawns and lawn mowing boys earning money for concerts and cigarettes. 
The neighborhood boys have declined as a local work force over the years. 
Out of the window of her not so unique ranch house, Juniper Marie Gladstone has watched the local boys being replaced by scruffy aliens. 
Not alien in the sense of extraterrestrial. 
 Alien in the sense of certainly not Americans. 
Whatever that means. 
The not Americans mowed the neighbor’s lawn with a sense of detached apathy. 
 He was just walking around the yard, pushing a machine with a motor that chopped the grass to equal lengths and some of it managed to ascend into a collection bag. 
Some of the clippings fell back on the lawn. 
Where they would sit until they dried and died and went back to the earth. 
 It was the kind of lawn that no one played on any more. 
Even in the summer with the overbearing heat and everything. 
The sprinklers were never ran through anymore. 
The kids didn’t have much use for it. 
There were places to play farther from home. 
Places with flashing lights and loud music and instant returns for monetary exchanges.
Jun stands at the window, sipping at a cup of tea and look slightly distraught. 
 She furrows her brow and wrinkles her  ose and twists her lips to one side, looking out the window.
“Juniper, dear, staring out that window isn’t going to solve anything.” A woman sits at Jun’s table, sipping at her own cup of tea and delicately nibbling away at a small sugar cookie. 
She’s the kind of woman that never ventures out of the house without a hat. 
 She the kind of woman you see in supermarket checkout lanes with well over fifteen items and coupons for every single thing. 
She will commandeer the attention and instigate the increasing vexation, of all who have to deal with her from the other side of the counter. 
She’s a menace in a floral print dress.
“I know. 
I know deary. 
But I can’t help but wonder.”
“About what pray tell?”
“About these kids. 
These kids today. 
I think there’s something wrong with them.”
“Juniper, darling, there’s always something wrong with the children. 
No matter where or when.”
“Well, yes Constance, I realize that. 
But these days I’m thinking it’s worse than it used to be. 
They don’t seem to have a care for god. 
They don’t have respect for their elders. 
They’re out of control and possibly malicious. 
I don’t trust them.”
“Oh, Juniper, you’re over reacting. 
They’re just kids, being kids. 
It’s nothing unusual. 
It’s not so different from when we were kids.”
“When we were kids? Goodness gracious. 
Did I really just hear you say that? Just like when we were kids. 
My golly. 
Well, I don’t think so. 
I don’t think so at all. 
The kids are all into that awful music with the loud thumping. 
And that language. 
Why I can’t understand what they’re saying half the time, talking so fast like that. 
And when I do understand all I hear are terrible things. 
The words they use. 
Would have made Robert blush. 
Certainly not nice things at all. 
And if they can’t say something nice. 
Well, you know. 
“And how they dress! Sakes alive Constance. 
They dress like clowns and prostitutes.” She says prostitutes as if she were about to throw up and was debating what to do with the contents of her mouth. 
“I can’t understand it, I really can’t. 
I suspect they may all be devil worshippers.”
“Really now Jun. 
Devil worshippers? Satanists?”
“Oh my yes. 
Listen. 
I was in church last Sunday, and the reverend was talking about how all these churches in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico were being burned to the ground. 
Not just one or two. 
 We’re talking somewhere around fifty or sixty. 
They’re calling it an epidemic. 
The most churches burned in a short span of time in recorded history. 
They’re saying that there’s a group of covert Satanists that are trying to take god away from everyone. 
They are burning the churches until there’s no where left to worship. 
It’s a plague, Connie. 
Not even in the South have they seen something like this.”
“My goodness! Was anyone hurt? Did they leave any markings? You know, graffiti?”
“I don’t think so no. 
But I heard from Abigail that her sister’s church near N- was burned to the ground. 
Nothing left but ashes and the foundation. 
She said the preacher’s cat was caught in the basement and died from the fumes, but other than that no one was hurt. 
 She said they didn’t leave any sign and there’s no evidence there was anyone was there. 
The church burned as if by an act of the Devil. 
I’m telling you, the kids these days are turning evil.”
“I’m not so sure. 
Maybe it’s not the kids. 
There could be some older people involved. 
You remember James? Ella’s uncle? He was a black magician. 
Ella told me that she found all these books and weird drawings. 
All in the attic where he spent so much time. 
Very strange business. 
But he wasn’t a Satanist.”
“Wasn’t a Satanist. 
Listen to yourself. 
He was a black magician, how is that any different?”
“Oh, I don’t know. 
Ella had a way of explaining it that made a kind of sense. 
She was very good at that kind of thing.”
“Well, I don’t trust it. 
Satanists and these kids with no respect at all. 
The whole country is going to pot.” Juniper sips her tea and takes a cookie from the plate. 
She doesn’t take a bite but rather sets it down next to her tea, as if she took the cookie prematurely, in expectation of wanting it sometime in the near future but not quite yet. 
The cookie sits by the tea wanting nothing, not noticing the negligence bestowed upon it.
Chapter sixteen:
County jail is not the most civilized of places. 
Everyone wears a uniform in county jail. 
Either a jumpsuit or a collared shirt with a badge and gun or a name tag with a pen. 
Hardly anyone smiles in county. 
There’s not a lot of reasons for anyone to smile. 
Roscoe has an orange jumpsuit on. 
He’s had the same orange jump suit on for much too long. 
 They gave him the jumpsuit and took everything else. 
His clothes. 
His wallet. 
They took his Identification card and gave him a number. 
There’s a room in county that looks and feels just like a similar room at the Department of Motor Vehicles. 
The same hard plastic chairs. 
The same small windows where uniformed employees take your prints, take a picture, make you fill out forms and sign them. 
The waiting rooms were designed by the same guy. 
The idea is make whoever is in this room loose all concept of time. 
Take away the sunlight and install energy saving fluorescents with low wattage output. 
Keep the room a little on the dim side except for the other side of the counter. 
Give the police some backlighting for dramatic stage presence. 
And give them something to stand on. 
Make them a little taller than whoever is on the other side. 
Standing on the other side will feel like being the presence of a parent, confronting you about your wrong doing. 
Being on the other side of the counter you will have to look up at a face in front of a light. 
Don’t be scared. 
This is textbook intimidation tactics. 
 The best thing to do right now is to take in the details. 
Absorb every instance, every face, what hangs on the walls, the pattern in the floors. 
Don’t be terribly concerned with the person behind the desk. 
He’s not here to help you. 
He’s just doing a job. 
Just keeping the books and booking you. 
Being in booking isn’t the type of job that people can really enjoy. 
There’s not a whole lot of ways to be happy in the work place. 
When you job is to file and keep track of prisoners, when the way that you pay rent involves treating people like cattle, there’s not a lot of options with it comes to down personal satisfaction at your place of employment.
After booking, Roscoe was allowed to change his clothes and use the restroom. 
There were no mirrors in the restroom. 
Had there been, if someone had wanted the prisoners to get one last look at themselves before being hauled away to their cell, before being taken to the yard; Roscoe would have seen himself reflected all wrong. 
The hues in his face wouldn’t not be normal. 
Years of farm work, of working in the sun and planting vegetables gave him a dark complexion. 
Years of lifting bags of mulch and soil, planting seeds, watering, weeding, harvesting. 
His appearance is normally athletic and tanned. 
In the mirror he’s hunched, his face is showing signs of sleep deprivation. 
Sunken eyes, heavy lids, hollow cheeks. 
 His complexion is fading rapidly due to malnourishment and a lack of sun or sleep.
He doesn’t know how long he’s been away. 
Could have been hours. 
Could have been days. 
No one tells him and they took his watch. 
He follows a guard to his cell. 
They walk down a long hallway lined with cells. 
Some of the men behind bars sit around staring at the walls or out of their cages. 
Some stand or lean around looking at things. 
Some of the inmates read whatever they can. 
Old newspapers magazines. 
Books from a small library of donated literature.
Roscoe eyes everything nervously. 
He’s too soft for this. 
He’s not a criminal. 
Some of these people may have stabbed someone or raped someone. 
Thieves and liars, murderers, junkies, and god knows what else. 
I’m not like them, he thinks. 
I’m not a real criminal. 
I don’t belong here. 
This has to be a mistake. 
I want a fucking lawyer Goddamnit. 
I  eed to call Laurel. 
But shit. 
Wait. 
If I only get one phone call should I call Laurel or a lawyer? I suppose one could call the other. 
And Laurel would be fucking pissed if I didn’t call her first. 
Maybe they have her too. 
Maybe she got roped in as well. 
Oh man. 
 She’s going to be so mad at me. 
This really fucking sucks. 
Roscoe kicks along to the cell. 
Not accepting his present reality. 
Denying all the way until the doors clang shut behind him and all he has now, his only possessions are a jumpsuit and a wristband. 
Well, he thinks. 
Well, at least there’s books. 
That’s something to do. 
I guess the biggest problem here is just passing the time. 
Don’t lose your mind. 
Stay calm and evaluate the situation. 
See what can be done. 
The guard makes sure everything is secure and starts walking away.
“Hey man, don’t I get a phone call or something?”
“A what?” The guard doesn’t answer. 
The reply comes from a few cells down. 
The voice sounds like it belongs to a very large man. 
The guard laughs a little. 
Not in the jovial sense. 
Not in the sense of something funny. 
He laughs condescendingly. 
 He laughs because Roscoe is just another poor bastard with delusions of jail being something like what he saw on television or a movie once. 
He laughs because as of right now, Roscoe really doesn’t have any rights. 
That’s more or less a bed time story the belongs outside of these walls. 
“Do you really think you get a phone call, motherfucker?”
Several other inmates laugh in the same manner. 
They chuckle and ridicule Roscoe in his naivety. 
Roscoe is like child that’s wondered into a bad scene. 
He’s wondering if this is the place where people get raped. 
He heard from one of his acquaintances that the best thing to do when you go to prison is pick out the toughest looking guy and just fight him without warning. 
No matter if you win or lose. 
You will have gained respect. 
And chances are, no one will fuck with you after that. 
It’s not that Roscoe is physically weak, more like he’s pacifist. 
And he’s kind of a pussy.
“Oh ho, a new feller.” A tired voice behind him startles the crap out of him. 
Almost literally. 
 He turns to the shadows and sees something like a face, ill lit and grinning at him in a way. 
“Ya look like yer ‘bout ta piss yerself, ahaw heh haw haw.” The face creeps slightly into the light and Roscoe see’s something almost human. 
The face has been long forgotten. 
No one has seen to care for this face for a long time. 
His face is like an envelope containing a love letter, sitting in the dead letter section of the post office with not enough postage. 
No one has bothered to dust the envelope in years. 
The dust lies everywhere, especially on the overlooked letters that no one has bothered to overlook.
A pair of eyes with wolf yellow mucas sick green tint glower from the darkness. 
A voice creeps along the floor towards Roscoe. 
In large communal showers, there’s a large drain in the middle. 
Over the corse of a day the dead skin, the hair, blood, the semen collect on the walls and the concrete or tiled floors. 
At the end of the day, there’s a man that comes to clean out the showers with a high pressured hose. 
He sprays up all the remains and reminders of of the bodies that came here to bathe. 
The water collects this mass of leftovers and pushes the whole thing towards the center drain. 
That’s how the voice creeps towards Roscoe.
“Say new feller. 
Say. 
Whaddaya think? I mean, so far. 
I mean, there’s only so much you could have taken in by now. 
But say, exactly, what does it do for you? First impressions. 
Et cetera.” He waits an unnaturally long time looking at Roscoe. 
Our boy is standing still, clutching his jumpsuit and looking wide eyed at his new roommate.
“I don’t belong here.” Roscoe lies.
“None of us do my boy. 
A heech. 
None the lot of us.” The face in the darkness looks down. 
He might has just closed his eyes. 
In this light, it’s not so clear. 
In this light he could be doing anything with his hands. 
He could be doing anything at all. 
 “You might as well sit down. 
Get used to it. 
Say, hey new feller. 
Heh. 
This your first time? You never been around these parts before yeah?  Mighty scared I guess. 
I mean, lookacha. 
You’re a mess. 
Nothing but a mess. 
Look like you done seen five ghosts all raping the ghost of your dead mother. 
But don’t worry about it. 
They’re just ghosts. 
Their rules are not our rules. 
They live, er, well I suppose it’s not really living. 
Could be that they’re stuck in the process of dying. 
I could see that as a reasonable solution. 
Stuck in the middle of the whole ordeal. 
Neither here nor there. 
Ya ever been neither here  or there? I’m there all the time. 
If I could get mail at that kind of address, why. 
I’d just settle in and take down the rent sign. 
Seems like the right kind of place for me. 
Right in between. 
Never quite settled, but ya know, always settled on being unsettled. 
Something like that. 
Something kind of not quite a nature. 
Something unnatural maybe. 
But that’s where I am. 
I guess that means this is here. 
Either way, feller. 
New feller that you are. 
Hardly know what you’ve got yourself into. 
It’s going to be a bit strange acclimating yourself to this kind of place. 
There’s lots of new rules. 
Lots of  ew people to meet and get used to. 
We are all living together. 
And finding all that stuff out. 
Lots to do. 
You’ll be plenty busy. 
Believe you me. 
Believe everything I say. 
 Just trust me. 
I’m a trust worthy kinda guy. 
First thing you should know. 
Beware of people that call you ‘buddy’. 
 Anyone that calls you buddy is not your buddy. 
Not your friend at all. 
Almost an enemy. 
But definetly someone to be wary of. 
Won’t hesitate to stab you in the back if it seems like a good idea at the time. 
Watch out for those guys. 
They’re easy to spot. 
The other ones are the ones that limp. 
There’s a good reason that they limp around. 
Trust me on this. 
I don’t think I could explain them to you. 
 I mean, logically speaking. 
The limp is a side effect of their lifestyle. 
Mighty terrible. 
Terrible people. 
Don’t believe those guys. 
They will fuck you up. 
If you know what I mean. 
And I think you do. 
Just be on your guard. 
Speaking of guards. 
Speaking of. 
Those guys are not human. 
They look and walk and talk like human beings. 
Like fellow men. 
But there’s something wrong with their brains. 
 Makes them behave in terrible ways. 
Makes them act like god’s own agents of death and might. 
Angels of vengeance and wrath. 
More like goons of the state. 
The fucking state with its goons. 
That’s why we’re all here. 
State goons. 
Brainless savages. 
 Nothing but thugs. 
You think there’s thugs behind bars. 
You should see the bastards guarding the bars. 
Make most of us look like sweet little children in comparison. 
 Make most of us look like fresh out of Sunday school, still in plaid, still wondering what the hell the preacher was blah blah blahing about. 
 See, listen, ya feel me? We’re pretty innocent in comparison to these guys. 
The slave drivers are the enemy and all that. 
The masters that makes the rules and what not. 
Those guys are the ones to fear. 
The ones with the billy clubs and the guns and shiney little badges that give them all the right in the world to crack your head open because they claim you were resisting arrest and you claim that you were just walking home and suddenly they want to know what you’re doing, and where you’re going and what’s in your pockets. 
And then they’ll run your ID. 
And find out you have a warrant and then here you are. 
Back in the joint. 
Those assholes. 
 I can’t believe what power has done. 
And these are men we’re talking about. 
We’re talking about fellow human beings here. 
Just like you an’ me. 
Except you know, not so much locked up. 
Still free to do as they please. 
Still free to pay rent and have families and move on with life. 
But not us. 
Not so much. 
Those bastards have decided that the likes of us ain’t no good out there. 
Like they’ll decide who’s ok. 
Like life has a guest list all of a sudden. 
 Goddamn state. 
With clubs and mace. 
Shit. 
Nothing but shit. 
I’ll tell you. 
I’ll have you know. 
There, out there. 
Where the enforcers are. 
That’s not civilization. 
That’s not civilized. 
You tell me that’s civilized and I’ll clock you in the jaw. 
Civilized. 
Puh. 
I’ll take my cell and my meal a day and an hour in the yard. 
I’ll take that and some good time to stare at the sky and dream a while. 
That’s ok. 
That seems fairly civil to me. 
Just feed me and let me dream. 
That’s all I ask. 
God. 
Who brought on this nightmare? And here. 
Here of all places. 
We’re so full of dopemen. 
Just dopes selling dope and getting in trouble for it. 
What a reason to be here. 
What a stupid reason to lock someone up. 
For doing a little business. 
A little supply and demand. 
That’s not right. 
That’s controlling the market. 
Only certain drugs from certain people are allowed on the market. 
Men don’t have the capacity to decide for themselves. 
That’s why we have doctors and judges and po-leese men. 
To help us make up our stupid minds. 
Because we’re inferior. 
That’s how they can get away with it. 
Because we buy into their crap. 
I don’t understand. 
I don’t understand how we’re so advanced. 
So civilized. 
And still we keep buying all this useless crap. 
We buy it from the state and the shopping malls. 
We buy from the TV late at night. 
We buy it from the preachers. 
When did we lose common sense and faith in ourselves? Tell me new feller. 
Tell me when we the people became so weak as to need another head, unconnected to our own to make up our minds for us. 
To know what’s best and what’s safe and heaven forbid you go through life with all the danger intact. 
That would be disasterous. 
Everyone would die. 
We must protect us from ourselves. 
So we create committees and watch groups and a police force to keep us in line. 
Because obviously we’re just a bunch of morons running around with our dicks in our own asses trying to make up from down and trying to go left and right at every intersection simultaneously. 
 Freedom. 
Puh. 
What a dirty word. 
There isn’t a people on earth that have ever known freedom. 
Maybe a few individuals. 
But as a group. 
As a whole or sections of a whole. 
Not a one. 
Believe you me. 
Not a one. 
We’re all too fucking stupid to see it. 
Hell, I don’t need my hand held. 
I’ve been around the block. 
I know what’s up and what’s going down. 
Take my word for it. 
Ridiculous. 
That’s what this is. 
Just utterly ridiculous. 
I don’t  eed  o fucking king. 
And I don’t need to pay tithe to the bastard either. 
That’s my own money. 
I earned it. 
He didn’t do shit for me. 
 Why should I give him ten percent? Or however much. 
What has he ever done for me personally that warrents him a percentage of my income? You answer me that. 
You tell me what he does that so fucking important. 
I certainly don’t know. 
I’ve seen him do nothing but start wars and piss off other countries with less to lose by getting involved. 
And there goes my money. 
Buying bombs and paying for pilots to fly them. 
Makes me sick, really it does. 
I sicked up three times this morning just thinking about it. 
Can’t stand this  onsense. 
This whole country is so backwards right now. 
 And everyone gets so hopeful when an election comes around. 
Like that’s ever going to change anything. 
You let me know when the revolution comes around. 
When we kill the oppressors and take our land back. 
Take our jobs back. 
Take back everything that the bastards took from us. 
Our things. 
Theft. 
Government is a thieving bully. 
 All around the world. 
There’s no such thing as a benevolent state. 
Believe me on this. 
Just trust me. 
I’ve been around the block. 
I know what’s up. 
I’m in the know.”
Chapter seventeen.
Waking up in a park ain’t that bad, really. 
You get the sound of traffic passing, birds in the trees. 
Someone across the way squabbling over cigarettes. 
Morning dew on your face and a few new sore spots. 
Just stretch and wake up. 
That’s all there is to do now. 
Once that’s done, the list of things to do today is complete. 
Relax. 
That’s about what you should be doing. 
It is a perfect, overcast late fall morning. 
The sky is a solid grey and only the round light of the sun breaks the homogeny. 
 Students with their red eyes and heavy book bags march to class from the dorms and cloisters, the co-ops and close to campus apartment complexes. 
The drop outs go to work and punch time cards in hopes of paychecks signed by bosses with very punchable faces. 
The harder working of the bums begin getting up and gathering half broken guitars, odds and ends percussion sections, any old noise maker will do. 
Something to attract attention. 
Get some pockets alieviated from the overburden of loose change and stray dollars bills that would have only landed in the tip jar of some snotty barrista. 
 Beecher was not one of harder working bums. 
Work is not so much an activity that Beecher took part in. 
He’s was more the observational type. 
He was around and felt little to no need for action. 
Whatever came along did so and he was not one to assist or deter, just to accept and move on. 
Beecher took a liking to a bench. 
He greeted the bench and sat down.
In the park there are people setting up for a concert. 
They move speakers and connect wires. 
A man choreographs the movements of the sound equipment. 
Men with tattoos and college guys that needed some weekend work. 
A few others unfurl a banner and stretch it between two poles. 
The banner reads, ‘Noodles and Jam - Music Festival and Spaghetti Feed’. 
 Beecher eyes a young woman in a gypsy skirt, dancing before the music arrived. 
 The citizens of the park seem to be behaving themselves in predictable ways. 
A young man sits on Beecher’s bench and doesn’t say anything. 
He looks out as if something important were happening just beyond the park. 
He looks through it but not at it.
“Hey kid. 
You here for the music festival?”
“And the spaghetti feed, I’m starving. 
Got an extra cigarette? Smokies?”
“Smokies? Jesus Christ, when will you kids leave me alone. 
I ran out of rollies last night.”
“Aw that’s a shame. 
I haven’t had a cigarette in twenty minutes. 
I think I might lose my mind. 
Have you ever been in love?”
“Sure. 
Here and there. 
Happens to the worst of us.”
The young man laughs in a perceptively forced manner. 
He thinks Beecher is trying to be funny, or witty, or just sarcastic. 
Beecher isn’t trying to be anything. 
He’s just half a bum. 
The laughter comes in a series of short lyrical ‘ha’s, each one accented individually.
“I don’t think I’m going to fall in love again. 
 I am continually disappointed with love. 
Every girl I meet isn’t capable of real love. 
They can never love me like I love them. 
I am doomed to walk the earth, always alone and unloved. 
Or at least, not loved to an acceptable degree.” The young man looks up at the sky, trying very hard to look deep in thought and stewing in memories of failed relationships.
“You just need to get your dick wet.” 
Beecher looks the young man over. 
He has long orange hair and a stubborn collection of stubble on his face, pretending to be a beard in some places, method acting as a goatee in others. 
He’s wearing some kind of Asian bathrobe. 
He wears it like a smoking jacket that ran out of cigarettes. 
The features of his face are sharp and sad. 
He opens his mouth again and emits the staccato laughter of washed up actors that once played arch villains on old TV shows use after three bottles of cheap wine while watching midnight reruns or their former glory.
“No. 
No I don’t think that’s it. 
Just getting laid wouldn’t solve my problems.”
“But you still want to get laid, right? You’re still a horny bastard and some sexin’ would do you good.” 
“Maybe. 
I guess. 
But sex without love just feels so empty to me. 
I couldn’t do it. 
If I ever fall in love again, she’s going to have to be just as in love with me. 
Otherwise, I don’t see the point.”
“The fuck do you care about love? Why does that really matter? Can’t you just be cool with your shit and not need some fucking woman to validate your own personal value? I bet I know what your problem really is. 
 I bet I know what really goes down. 
You get all needy because you think you  eed someone else’s love when really, that’s nice and all, but you don’t need it. 
You want it really bad, sure. 
Everyone wants to be loved more than they are. 
That’s just human nature. 
But we’re all selfish and self centered. 
The best you can do is learn to love yourself and if other people love you to, then congrats. 
You’re not doing so bad. 
Besides, when you say you love someone more than they love you, you’re full of shit. 
You’re just greedy for attention. 
And you don’t really love them. 
That’s fucking horseshit. 
You just want to feel important and wanted. 
You want to be desirable and necessary for whoever’s happiness. 
That’s just your own selfishness coming back around to bite you in the ass.”
The young man smiles at the sky condescendingly. 
He smiles like a professor of English literature being forced to listen to kindergarten students reading aloud their accounts of summer vacation. 
He says, “Maybe you’re right.” He says it in such a way that says, “You’re not right at all. 
I alone know the details of my tragedy. 
And I am doomed in my loneliness. 
No one can help me, because my problem is beyond the understanding and capacity of most people.”
Beecher spits on the ground. 
“I’ve been around a while. 
I’m pretty much in the know about these things.”
The exaggerated laughter comes out again. 
It stumbles out like a wino out of a water closet. 
The young man looks vacantly involved with nothing in particular. 
“Well old man, you got a name?”
“Of course I have a  ame. 
That’s a ridiculous fucking question. 
And it’s Beecher. 
Just call me Beecher if you feel compelled to call me something other than old man.”
“Alright.” He sits there in anticipation for a few minutes. 
“Don’t you want to know my name?”
“Not really.” Beecher coughs and makes an effort to get all the snot out of his throat, coughing and spitting up whatever he can get.
“My name’s Parsley Thumbs Burnside. 
Most people just call me Thumbs though. 
It’s a bit of a mouthful of a name. 
My mother must have thought it was a cute name to garnish me with. 
She must have thought my thumbs would lead me to greatness. 
Today is the first day I’ve been outside in seven months. 
My thumbs have lead me to level seven of Dragon Demon Temple Thief. 
I’m only outside because the power went out. 
I think someone forgot to pay the bill. 
I’m don’t really care. 
It’s nice to be outside, at a spaghetti feed with the common folk.”
“You callin’ me common?” Beecher almost seems offended. 
He seems like he’d much rather taste his own mucus and chew on his lips and cough up lung butter.
“Oh not you. 
I’m talking about the worker bees out there, with their silly jobs. 
Earning wages and paying for parking and working power outlets. 
What kind of life is that? Working. 
Honestly, I just don’t understand some people. 
Why go through all the trouble? There are other ways to get by than work. 
It’s terribly tiring and such a hassle. 
Not to mention the people you have to deal with. 
They’re always so incompetent and bossy. 
Worker bees are so boring. 
Just clock in, clock out, go to bed, wake up, clock in. 
At least someone is getting something done, I suppose. 
But really, not my problem. 
What a waste of time.”
“Did you really just accuse the stagehands of wasting their time when all you do is play fucking video games?”
“That’s not all I do. 
I have to sleep sometimes. 
Sometimes I sleep for days on end. 
I’m so very tired all the time. 
Living is such a tiring business.”
“Kid, you don’t know the meaning of living. 
How old are you?”
“Twenty three.”
“Figured it’d be something like that. 
Listen. 
 Listen very carefully to me. 
I’m going to give you the best advice anyone has ever given you. 
You should go home and drop your television from a very high place. 
You should watch it fall to the ground and shatter below. 
Don’t clean it up. 
Leave it as a reminder. 
Don’t be tempted to get a new one or borrow a friend’s. 
Do the same thing to your computer. 
 Destroy it. 
Render it unusable. 
The benefits will manifest almost immediately. 
You might be forced to do something with your mind. 
You might find a way to deal with time in a creative manner. 
All of this is hypothetical, or course. 
You’d probably just sleep more and stare at the space where the television once was. 
That sounds like the extent of your capabilities.”
“Dude, that was a little harsh. 
I just met you and you already hate me, proving my original point of being unlovable. 
 I am doomed.” Thumbs Burnside leans his head back with exaggerated effort. 
He lets out a sigh that would make the virgin Mary roll her eyes. 
His sigh is a dozen rafts with punctured lungs lying on couches, telling a dozen therapists about how mother never seemed to have enough time to pay attention because she was working two jobs and looking for a new daddy. 
“You’re a very depressing person. 
Have you ever considered suicide as an answer? I mean, I’m sure you’ve thought about killing yourself a few times,”
“A few times? Man, I think about suicide twice as often as I beat off. 
 Sometimes I wear all black and walk in the middle of street at night in cautious optimism. 
I’ve listened to old radios in the bath tub. 
I’ve stored all the cleaning chemicals in easy to reach places. 
I’ve left knives lying around, just in case. 
Now, I figured that I’d just chain smoke. 
The cancer will catch up to me at some point.”
“Yeah, but smoking is just a passive aggressive suicidal tendency. 
That’s a real half assed way of going about it. 
If you really wanted to die, you’d be dead by now. 
If you were serious in your efforts, it wouldn’t have taken more than five minutes. 
You seem more like a bridge jumper to me. 
I’ve known a few bridge jumpers that were better men than you. 
They had something to live for. 
But you’re an enigma. 
I just don’t understand why you bother to keep breathing. 
You’re taking up valuable resources from the rest of us.”
“Well, if I don’t do it, someone else will. 
My existence is necessary. 
I’m a vital part of the human experience. 
 I need to be around for a while.”
“Why? You’re not vital at all. 
No one needs you around.”
“What about my mother? She still loves me. 
She wants me around.”
“I have my doubts. 
When’s the last time you saw her?”
“I talked to her last year on her birthday. 
Gave her a phone call. 
She sounded very concerned about me. 
She even said she loved me.”
“She’s full of shit. 
She probably just wants you to die and get it over with. 
She couldn’t be anything but disappointed in you. 
I mean, look at you. 
You’re a waste. 
You’re a parasite. 
You’ve been leeching off the charity of others for days. 
And when they run out of things for you to suck on, you move on to the next host. 
You should be ashamed, but I know that you’d rather be deeply enamored with your own pity. 
You’re a narcissist. 
But you also hate yourself. 
Go for a walk. 
Find a bridge. 
I’m going to town. 
There might be a friend of mine that wears trash bags. 
He’s got nothing except his trash bags and a smile. 
He’s completely content with his life. 
He’s a beautiful man.”
“Whatever. 
Other people are so boring. 
You bore me too.”
“You said you were starving earlier?”
“Yeah, haven’t eaten in two days.”
“Go eat a dick.” Beecher reaches into his pocket and pulls out a guitar slide. 
He holds it in his hand and makes a fist around it. 
The half bum pulls back and punches Parsley Thumbs Burnside in the jaw. 
Beecher shakes his hand from the tension and stands up. 
Thumbs holds his face in his hands and starts sobbing quietly to himself. 
Beecher spits again. 
He coughs up a sizable wad diaphragm juice and projects it on to Parsley’s Asian bathrobe.
Chapter Eighteen.
“I can’t make sense of this shit.” A man in plain clothes says.
“Yeah?” Answers a man in wearing a hat and jacket. 
Two men drink from identical white mugs of coffee simultaneously. 
There’s a knock at the door. 
A silhouette stands behind the frosted glass.
“Come in.”
The door opens enough for a head to poke in, a woman in her early thirties with vibrant curly red hair, pulled back conservatively appears.
“Chief wants to you two. 
Pronto.”
“Ah Jesus. 
I knew this was coming.”
“Well, let’s not keep the old man waiting.” Two coffee mugs are set down in similar looking rings on a heavy oak desk.
The walk to the chief’s office is through the bullpen of cubicles and general insanity that occupies a police station during the later afternoon of a major city. 
Voices holler at each other from across the room. 
Interns with stacks of paper scurry around from office to office. 
Suspenders and white shirts with bland neckwear and loafers. 
Office cops doing paper work. 
The two men knock on another frosted glass door that bears the title ‘Chief’.
“Sinclair! Templeton! Get your asses in here.”
The two men enter and close the door behind them.
“Have a seat, this might take a few minutes of your precious time. 
I know your time is fucking precious because I see when you punch in and out of this place. 
I know how much effort you put in your goddamn cases. 
And why I keep you two on payroll is almost as mysterious as why this Canada thing is still in your hands. 
We should have turned this over to the FBI months ago. 
Months is a long fucking time to be working on the case. 
Now let me run over what I have from your two idiots so far. 
Around thirty missing bodies, stolen from morgues or graveyards or funeral homes. 
Some five hundred pounds of dope recovered from trucks heading north to the boarder. 
And there’s this church burning thing. 
I don’t see how the missing bodies and the church burnings tie in. 
That doesn’t make a lick of sense to me. 
Why you fucking kids think there’s some connection, I have no idea. 
Maybe you’ve been pinching from the evidence locker. 
Wouldn’t be surprised. 
You mothers must have smoked a lot of that coke when you were germinating in their bellies. 
So please. 
Explain to me your fucking theory. 
Let’s see what the hell you knuckleheads have come up with.”
The plain clothes man is named Pete Templeton. 
He’s been a detective in the Bay Area for some ten odd years. 
The hat and jacket is named Addison Sinclair. 
He’d be considered a rookie. 
He’s Pete’s latest partner. 
The last one ended up in therapy with a lawsuit against the whole department. 
The affair was messy. 
The paper work alone took the better part of a month. 
Pete’s last partner ended up in the hospital with a broken leg and three bullets in his foot. 
His account of the incident cleared Pete of man slaughter charges, but most of the department knew he started firing. 
According to the official report a large man—Darnell Evan Jones III—was seen fleeing the scene of an attempted car theft. 
The passenger window was shattered, shots were heard around the block. 
Neighbors reported loud shouting. 
The large man ran down a side street and was trying to hop a fence at the end. 
Pete saw him climbing and opened fire. 
Just warning shots over the top of the fence. 
Something to scare the shit out of him and let him know that the police were here and that he was fucked. 
The large man turned around, still clinging to the chain links and drew a pistol from his coat. 
He fired half a clip in the general direction of the cops, thinking someone was trying to kill him. 
Possible someone that just got out of a car with a broken window. 
The most of the bullets hit nothing worth noting. 
 A few hit the partner. 
Pete figured he was out, or at least close to out of bullets and ran closer to get a better shot. 
He didn’t notice his partner was on the ground. 
He didn’t notice that the large man had back up—Micah Johnson-Gilas and Jorge Manual Rivas—with blunt instruments coming to meet him, closing everyone in the ally. 
The partner was clubbed with a baseball bat. 
They broke a rib and his leg. 
When the bat came up the next time, the chest of the man holding was pumping hot lead and emitting a stream of crimson. 
One down. 
Pete turned and shot four bullets into the face of the large man on the fence. 
His inner most thoughts landed on the concrete below and he dropped down to meet them. 
The third assailant was shot once in the pelvis. 
He dropped his weapon and fell to his knees. 
The autopsy later revealed that his face had suffered a severe beating from a police issue pistol. 
His  eck was broken and both hands had been crushed with the force of militant boots. 
Pete’s old partner was named James Jonas Marshall and no one in the department talked about him when Pete was around.
Addison knew most of this and never brought it up. 
Addison was a good talker. 
He was good brains. 
He made a good sidekick, but he wasn’t as action oriented as Pete. 
They complimented each other well in the field. 
Addison started to explain.
“Well, Chief. 
The way we figure it is like this. 
We traced incidents back to Chicago sometime last year. 
We don’t know exactly when everything started, but the Chicago papers gave enough clues to give us a ballpark figure. 
The first church burning in the Chicago area occurred about seven months ago. 
Everyone suspected the building was just old and had bad wiring. 
Someone left a lamp on that malfunctioned and started the blaze in the basement. 
It looked like a freak accident. 
A month later across town another church went down due to bad wiring. 
Now, Chicago is known for some old churches and a few famous fires. 
The papers covered the stories as if The Devil had manifested and started taking down the houses of god, one by one. 
Believers thought the end times were here. 
Hysteria was spreading. 
People were getting scared. 
The third building caught a blaze only two weeks later. 
This time an outside outlet over burdened with Easter lights went nuts. 
In all the cases the fire took everything. 
Either reducing the parish to ashes, or leaving a blackened shell. 
All the wood was old. 
The paint was old. 
Church goers set up message boards and began suspecting foul play. 
They started thinking that they were being targeted but a malevolent force…”
“Just a minute now, Sinclair. 
You want me to believe that Satan is behind these acts of terrorism? Islamic fundamentalists?”
“Let me finish. 
I’m just starting.” Addison clears his throat. 
“Could we get some coffee?” He lights a cigarette and prepares the information in his mind. 
“Soon after the third burning, the Chicago cops were looking for answers. 
They too suspected something was up. 
Three churches in two months was enough to rile anyone into suitable paranoia. 
In each case there was nothing terribly out of the ordinary. 
No calling card, no signs of group activity. 
When a terrorist group commits an act, they tend to have a purpose or leave a message. 
They want people to know there was a reason behind the destruction. 
But, like I said, nothing. 
Just three old buildings up in flames with bad electricity. 
 Now, about three weeks after the first church went down, one of the cops noticed that the cemetery had been tampered with. 
One of the graves, the most recent addition, had loose dirt over it. 
A little too loose for comfort. 
He investigated and had the site exhumed. 
 He found nothing, that is, there was no body. 
The casket was there, but the corpse was missing. 
He placed the time of retrieval around the day before the burning happened. 
As we all know, a coincidence is never just a coincidence. 
The officer conducting the investigation found a few more bodies were missing from a nearby morgue. 
The bodies seemed to disappear a day or two before a church went up in smoke. 
By the time he discovered this, another church went down, outside of his jurisdiction, a state away, in fact, along the old highway. 
Now, his reports end about there. 
He must have been called off the case and I don’t know what happened to it. 
The churches of Chicago seemed to stabilize after that. 
No more incidents have occurred since. 
But along the old highway, the same pattern emerged. 
Churches went down. 
Always with electrical problems. 
No sign, no trace of foul play. 
Just some electricians mistake and a few stiffs no one could account for. 
When the Texas panhandle got hit, the people went nuts. 
They started flooding the churches and keeping vigils. 
They’d stay in the church all night, and post watch. 
But once again, as soon as they caught on, a few towns down the road it started all over again. 
There was one incident where a body was actually taken from the casket an hour before the funeral was scheduled. 
 People panicked and prayed.”
“What about the dope? The churches and the bodies are one thing. 
I can see what you’re getting at. 
But still, no Canada, no dope. 
Get to the fucking point already.” 
A girl wearing a smart business skirt and blouse arrives with a tray of coffee mugs. 
She sets the tray down and leaves the offices without saying a word to anyone.
“Hold on, Chief. 
This is where it starts to get a little strange. 
 Now, we all know the Canadians are a bit more liberal about dope up there. 
They treat it less like medicine or a drug then we do. 
There’s really no  eed to be importing dope to Canada. 
Most of the traffic is in the opposite direction. 
But right around the time the churches started to burn in Broom, Texas the first van of dope was stopped on the way north, just outside of Trinity County. 
 The car had Canada plates and a Canadian driver. 
He spoke only French and by the time they found a suitable translator, he had enough legal help to post bail. 
All his identification papers were fakes. 
The plates on the van didn’t match anything in the system. 
 He was basically a ghost in a dead car. 
No one has yet to track him down. 
There was a side note in one of the Trinity police reports, not the official one, that lists a human body as part of the cargo. 
 An autopsy revealed that the corpse died of cancer a week earlier, in Oklahoma City. 
Before press, the official report lacked this detail, which is odd enough. 
But the really strange thing is that no one in the Trinity police department can recall who made the report or any details concerning the incident. 
Also the body showed no signs of decay or mummification.”
The chief leans back in his chair which squeaks pungently. 
He looks at the ceiling, mulling this new information over in his mind. 
 “If what you’re saying is true… If all this information is related… Then we’re dealing with something big. 
Really big. 
Making this case would be big time for everyone. 
Major funding for the department and everything. 
This looks like an international incident. 
Religious warfare, even. 
I want you boys to keep me updated on everything you find out. 
Everything. 
And document every fucking detail. 
I don’t want those cocksuckers in the FBI or the CIA to beat us on this one. 
They interfere with us enough. 
Oh, and whatever happened to that arrest made outside of Davenport? Did he gives us anything?”
“Nothing much, really. 
He admits that dealt with the Canadians, but seems rather ignorant of the details. 
Probably just a routine dope deal for him. 
Either way we have him with enough product for intent to sell and admission of guilt to selling across borders. 
He’s rotting away in county still. 
I don’t think he knows much else.”
“Well then, we’ll let the little fucker stagnate for a while. 
Most we can do is give him a slap on the wrist then let him go. 
But I want him followed. 
I want to know what he eats and where he shits. 
Full surveillance. 
Did you record his phone call?”
“Of course. 
He only wanted to make one. 
To his girlfriend.”
“Isn’t that fucking sweet. 
Do we know anything about her? Do you think she was in on it?”
“When he made the call, he had to leave a message. 
We called the phone company and she hasn’t paid her bill in over a month. 
His message didn’t contain anything useful. 
Just the usual, ‘Hey honey, I’m in jail for some bullshit, please save me’ kinda thing. 
We ran background on her and started a file. 
She hasn’t come home in two weeks. 
We have a guy staking the place out, just in case. 
Her name is Laurel Jean Piedmont, age twenty four, one sister Marjorie, parents divorced. 
One misdemeanor charge when she was eighteen for an open bottle and underage consumption. 
Other than that, nothing much. 
If she pops up, we’ll let you know.”
“Good. 
Alright, I’ve heard enough. 
Fuck off and let me get back to work. 
Oh, and Templeton… If you so much as step out of line on this case… If I hear anything about bullets or brutality or anything. 
It’s your ass. 
You came too close to bringing us down before. 
If you fuck this up, so help me god. 
It won’t just be your badge. 
You’re a walking disaster, Templeton. 
 I trust you’ve learned from your mistakes.”
“I don’t trust a goddamn thing.” Pete says.
Chapter nineteen.
The messages on Laurel’s phone were as follows:
“Hey Laurel… It’s me. 
Umm… It looks like I’m in jail or something. 
I don’t know if they’re going to let me go. 
They never specified the charges. 
It’s not like the ATF or DEA came after me. 
They won’t let me talk to a lawyer and I think this is my only phone call. 
It was either you or mom. 
I guess that should mean something. 
But hey, look. 
If you could come down here and try to visit, maybe we could work something out. 
I mean, this is still America. 
 I still have rights, right? They can’t hold on to me forever for no discernable reason. 
I mean, I guess there was a lot of weed in the house, or whatever. 
But that shouldn’t be such a big deal. 
These guys are real assholes. 
Also there’s this crazy motherfucker in my cell. 
He keeps trying to talk politics at me. 
He’s really starting to piss me off. 
Also it’s really boring here. 
Almost nothing to do. 
I haven’t been stoned in days. 
I’m losing my mind. 
Please come get me. 
I  eed you. 
I… I love you. 
Bye.” Beep.
“Lars! It’s Marji. 
What the hell did you feed Dutch? He’s been shitting white foam and puking up black tar for the last two days. 
I swear to shit, I hope it wasn’t that block of cheese. 
 That thing has been in the fridge since I moved in. 
If you kill my dog, I will find you. 
I will track you down and dump all the vom and shit in a bag and put the bag over your head. 
I will then proceed to beat you upside the head and spin you around in the shitty puke bag until you start puking and shitting on yourself. 
I will beat you until you shit blood. 
Ps. 
Call me, I miss you. 
And how’s Berk-town? Lots of love.” Beep.
“Goddamnit Laurel, I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for three days now. 
And I swear to Christ if you ate a bunch of those goddamn brownies and haven’t been able to get off the couch for a week like that one time last year, you’re fired. 
 I mean it this time. 
We all love you very much, but I simply can’t afford to keep you on payroll if you pull this shit. 
We need you out here. 
The turnips are a bumper crop this year and we need a few more hands to help out. 
Also the market wouldn’t be the same. 
Anyway, this is Nancy. 
Again. 
Call me. 
It’s Nancy. 
From work.” Beep.
Well, at least everyone loves me. 
I sat and stared at the phone, wondering who, if anyone I should call, for the better part of an hour. 
I stared and stared but the answer never came. 
I was sitting on the steps of the campus, contemplating my next move. 
Where to go from here? The Mess and Shambles might know someone or something. 
They seem to have a few connections. 
I think. 
I mean, we have sold a good amount of weed during the last week, right? We did sell that weed… Right?  Jesus. 
The spot where I’m sitting offers the view of a fountain. 
There’s a large building with unimpressive architecture to my left and an archway on the right. 
The students pass underneath, coming and going with all their baggage. 
Some of them stop and talk. 
Some of them have set up booths for various interest groups. 
Students for a Better World, Berkeley Republicans Club,  Jazz Appreciation Society, Jogging Our Way To Freedom and so on. 
They really are very pretty, the students. 
So full of youth and information and passion about the world around them or the world in their heads. 
I wonder what that must be like. 
 To be a student at Berkeley. 
I wonder what they must think about all day and what keeps them up at night. 
I wonder how many of them spend all day thinking about after this as opposed to say, living in the here and now and thinking about getting by until tomorrow. 
Even then, that’s not really here and now. 
That’s tomorrow. 
And tomorrow can wait. 
Right now there’s a beautiful campus full of old, rich looking buildings. 
There’s so many lovely trees and paths to walk. 
I think I’m going to take one now.
I head under the gate and continue straight on until the clock tower. 
The Shambles said this was the tallest clock tower in, either northern California, or The Northwest. 
Something like that. 
It’s a pretty fucking tall clock tower. 
The sounds resounding from the tower are deep and appealing. 
 It has the charm of old world Europe. 
I mean, I’ve never been there, but from pictures and a few travelogues, from documentaries and movies n’ stuff. 
I think that’s what old world Europe is supposed to look like. 
It’s also symbolic of a giant, majestic penis. 
 And if Berkeley has the tallest tower, Berkeley is going to get all the chicks. 
That’s the logic behind the architecture.
I make a right and walk up a path of notable steepness. 
It’s not so much a strain on the legs as it is a definite incline. 
I know I’m walking uphill. 
I walk up and weave between classrooms and libraries. 
All the buildings are named after someone only the tour guides still care about. 
On the tour they will tell you a short anecdote about their life and kinds of special things they did for the school. 
The tour guide only cares about this during the tour. 
For the most part, they’re just buildings and the names help us identify them and  avigate between them. 
After a while there’s another fountain on my right. 
Impulsively, I walk towards it and am hit by the sudden need to pee. 
I take another right, since I’m on a roll, ending up in some kind of art building. 
I check the map on the wall and look for a restroom. 
 I have to make an L either way no matter which hall way I choose. 
The restrooms are equidistant from the doors. 
Who designs these layouts? Don’t they ever think about how many students a day are going to need to use a restroom and turn into the closest building hopes of finding relief and discovering nothing but a long, restrained walk to the opposite end. 
Wouldn’t it make more sense to design buildings where people work and learn with restrooms right by the doors?
I walk to the opposite end of the building and find the room with the pictogram of a woman because she’s wearing a skirt in a blue circle. 
That symbol means I’m saved. 
I rejoice and enter a stall, pulling down my pants without ceremony but with speed and accuracy. 
 I take a seat and everything makes sense for a few seconds. 
The tint of the lights becomes a little whiter. 
My whole body feels like it has taken a breath of fresh air. 
I notice the door of the stall is decorated with familiar markings. 
The  ever mistakable scrawl of permanent pens in a restroom. 
There’s a lot of the usual graffiti here. 
 ‘Felicity is a whore’. 
‘Gary Shuin has hepatitis’. 
 Various names and dates signed. 
‘I shat here for five hours. 
It was amazing. 
– Emily A. 
Fall ’01’. 
‘Best sex I ever had was right where you’re shitting now. 
–Valerie P. 
ps fuck Stanford!!!’. 
On the right wall there’s a full conversation. 
Each line is in a different person’s handwriting and various colors of ink were used. 
There was a question at the top, in dark purple. 
‘What do you think you’re doing here?’ below it seemed that several people would answer the question and several people would reply to everyone else. 
The same ink and handwriting that started this reoccurred haphazardly. 
As if there was a frequented stall of hers. 
A place that she liked to hang out at. 
She would ask more questions like, ‘What are you goals and ambitions?’ ‘In the near future it will be possible to travel back in time, at will, to fix our mistakes. 
However we would only be able to accomplish this by eating a type of berry that contained a type of chemical that made you horrendously fat over a fairly short amount of time. 
The weight would follow you no matter how far back you went. 
For a roundtrip ticket to the past and back, you’d gain twenty pounds. 
Do you use the berries, seldom, often or never?’. 
 The responses took up a good two square feet of space. 
 Was this constructive graffiti? A real, live message board. 
Off line and in a restroom stall. 
What a strange and sort of beautiful idea. 
Totally anonymous if someone wants to be. 
Just doing a little creative vandalism. 
School property and all. 
 But oh well. 
It was a nice break from the gossip and crass humor I’m accustomed to in these settings. 
I wipe off and walk out with my pants up and my hands washed and face cleaned and hair straightened. 
Back down the long hall and towards the doors, reversing my L and hearing a strange noise coming from the stairwell. 
 Upon closer inspection the stairwell has some wicked acoustics. 
The echo in here is perfect. 
The reverberation is amazing. 
A musician has taken advantage of the sound quality. 
He stands at the base of the stairs walking in circles. 
He’s blowing himself blue on a harmonica. 
His hands move across his face like a man eating corn off the cob in a competition. 
He wails and bends and toots his way along, sounding something like a train under the influence of whiskey and wine and women. 
 He mutters and sputters and makes a song out of a few notes that he found lying around. 
He weaves something like a narrative from stray bits of sonic vibrations he chances upon. 
The air of the song is haphazard, obeying no structure and following no cohesive pattern. 
Instead he seems to switch between various patterns. 
Repeating some often and bring an old one back for a one shot run through. 
He spins and whirls and creates a dizzy drunken rambling off track never ending harmonica solo. 
He has to run out of breath sometime. 
He can’t hang on to this forever. 
 I can’t wait long enough. 
I should get going. 
Outside the air is crisp and cool. 
The darkness swings around early and everyone is still going or coming. 
Entering or leaving. 
Neither where they want to be or where they came from. 
 I check my phone for the time and it’s just after five in the afternoon. 
 Might as well start walking back. 
Stop by the market again. 
 Get back to the boys and their odd monastery. 
Cook some dinner. 
Drink a few beers, smoke a few bowls. 
Relax and figure out a game plan. 
That sounds like a good idea. 
That’s a pretty agreeable way of going about this business. 
Besides, I feel like asking the guys what they’d do. 
Don’t worry about it. 
That’s probably what they’d say. 
Just relax. 
Something will come along. 
How typically lazy of them. 
No effort required. 
I guess it is a kind of Zen thing, really. 
 Action through not acting. 
Something like that. 
The Mess was mumbling about it the other night. 
Woo something or other. 
 It sounded very much like a lazy kind of philosophy.
I make my way back down Telegraph. 
Past a few head shops, a few tattoo parlours. 
A few vintage clothing stores and more than enough markets. 
I walk Telegraph to Dwight. 
 Dwight to Shattuck. 
Shattuck to Derby and there’s the farmer’s market. 
I weave my way down to the booth I usually work at and find Tia.
“Hey T.” I wave at her.
“Laurel! Jesus Christ, where have you been? We’ve been looking and calling and wondering what the hell have you been. 
I was worried fucking sick. 
My god. 
If you only knew the kind of stress I’ve gone through over you’re little disappearing act… So anyway, yeah. 
Nancy told me about what happened. 
Sorry to hear that. 
When are you coming back to work?”
“I don’t know yet. 
This might take a few more days. 
I just got the message from Roscoe. 
He said they won’t let him talk to a lawyer and I was his only phone call. 
I don’t really think it’s safe to go into Davenport just yet.”
“Why’s that? Your boy’s sitting around in county, how is that your problem? Did you two do something stupid?”
“No! Well, nothing that stupid. 
We had a lot of plants on our property, but who doesn’t up there?  We both have medical cards. 
It shouldn’t have been a big deal. 
But the most they could do in that case would be to confiscate the plants and give Roscoe a slap on the wrist. 
He should be out by now. 
I don’t know, T. 
I’ll call you or Joe or someone as soon as I know anything for sure.”
“Well, shit dude. 
I guess that’ll have to do for now. 
You hungry? We have these cranberry beans. 
We have lots of cranberry beans. 
You should take some home with you. 
You should take some cranberry beans home. 
Or where ever you’re staying. 
Where are you staying, by the way?”
“Uh, some friends of my sister. 
I think.”
“Right. 
Ok. 
That’s cool or whatever. 
So, beans? Yes? No?”
“Sure, I’ll take a few pounds. 
Fresh beans would do good. 
What else you got?”
“Let’s see, we got the usual herbs. 
Some last of season dry farm tomatoes. 
Romano beans, haricot vert, some chicories. 
 Take your pick, you know the stock by heart.”
“Yeah, alright.”
After hitting up a few other booths, I had the makings of a good meal for three people. 
Tonight would be a nice meal and lots of beer and weed and we could go from there. 
That sounds wonderful. 
I turn onto Martin Luther King Jr. 
Way until I see Russell and walk down to Sacramento. 
The guys are in the middle of a jam session. 
The Mess plays a guitar while the Shambles plucks at an instrument of his own design. 
He bends a hinge to adjust the tension on the strings. 
He plucks at it with a chunk of plastic and metal picks on his three smaller fingers. 
No one looks up as I enter the room. 
Deep in the jam and unwilling to break concentration for anything. 
I ask if anyone is hungry. 
 Instead of words I get notes. 
Instead of replies I see heads nodding. 
 That’s enough of an answer for me. 
I start shucking the beans hear a knock at the door. 
The boys do nothing about it so I open it. 
In front of the door is the man that nature forgot to kill. 
He stares back at me as I look on at him in shock and horror. 
The dehydrated husk of a man that used to be a boy that said, ‘why not?’. 
 A black and white cat looks at a mouse and starts saying hello until the projector snags and the tape slows down and a door slams in the cats face in the middle of saying, “Heeey”
Chapter Twenty.
In the sprawl, in the middle of a section of suburbia, there’s a church and preacher that live across from each other. 
They have a mutual relationship of a fairly parasitic nature. 
It had been Alcoholics Anonymous night. 
It had been a Wednesday. 
In the den of Rev. 
Carmichael’s home he sits in his chair with a copy of the collected works of Arthur Conan Doyle. 
He reads by the light from a lamp and drinks from a glass of scotch and ice. 
The good reverend has had five scotches since the meeting adjourned. 
He read through a pair of bifocal reading glasses and drank from his scotch. 
In the story, Sherlock Holmes plays the violin and imbibes cocaine. 
He hears a ghastly story and very patiently displays everyone’s ignorance at the obvious connections in a chain of events and unmasks the perpetrators. 
Always with so much class. 
Doyle could write a satisfactory mystery story. 
The Reverend sat in his chair thinking about pulling out his pipe in order to complete his surroundings. 
The ice and scotch mingled together, alleviating the aromas and letting them wander the airways into Rev. 
Carmichael’s nostrils, sending a signal to his synapses to fire in his brain, and recalling another time he had drank this brand and vintage of scotch. 
 He was a young man at the time, first getting a taste for that particular poison. 
 He was living alone and in a major city for the first time. 
Fresh out of college and thinking himself to be a man now, for the first time. 
He was an adult. 
He had grown up. 
To celebrate his maturity, he went out and purchased a fifth of expensive scotch. 
He stayed up until dawn, drinking alone in his apartment. 
When the sun started to come up, when the earth took on an orange hue, he threw the bottle out of his fifth story window. 
He listened to the sound of the glass shattering on the concrete below and fell asleep, on the floor by the window. 
A dog barks somewhere in the sprawl. 
A dog is always barking somewhere in the sprawl. 
 Just like the sound of sirens is  ever a long ways away. 
Always something going on. 
 The words on the pages of the book begin to blur and change positions. 
The preacher man has reread the last paragraph in various degrees eleven times over the last few minutes. 
He adjusts his reading glasses and walks into the kitchen for more scotch. 
He walks over in the liquor cabinet in a pair of well worn slippers, taking a bottle from inside and unscrewing the lid. 
He pours the scotch into the glass, letting the amber liquid settle half way up. 
He motions to the freezer and extracts three ice cubes. 
The cubes crack on contact. 
Shattering a line split in several directions simultaneously. 
The reverend walks back to his study to fetch his pipe. 
And to pray that the tobacco isn’t all that stale. 
Rev. 
Carmichael has been leading the A.A. 
meetings for the last four months. 
He figured it would be a good idea for his community. 
There were more liquor stores per block in the  eighborhoods around the church than there were bus stops. 
Tramps and bums could be seen walking around, pushing stolen shopping carts packed with recyclables. 
Hoping for enough empty cans to purchase a full one. 
Kind of like buy fifty get one free. 
The drinking problem became more apparent after the accident. 
A drunk driver involved in family deaths will become a life long obsession with alcohol. 
It’s prevention and cure and cause and effect. 
 After the accident is also when the scotch and the rum came back into the reverend’s life.
After marriage, the reverend broke up with the bottle and remained sober. 
He married a nice small town girl and had two predictable children. 
They were rebellious in their own small way, but they were preacher’s kids. 
Rebellion comes naturally. 
 It should be expected. 
 Kids are always going to rebel until they start imitating. 
When they are older, and if their parents are honest enough with them, they will see themselves replicating the decisions of their parents, reconfigured for the present day. 
This may provoke change in the behavior of the child, but it will also reinforce the logic behind it. 
Learning the history of the parent will justify the same decisions in the child. 
If it worked for them or didn’t. 
But the reverend’s kids were by no means bad. 
They just did fairly normal things. 
Maybe the boy got into a fight at school. 
Maybe the girl went on a date and came home past curfew. 
Nothing terrible. 
They didn’t have prison records.
The wife was typical for preachers. 
That is, she was always looking for something to occupy her time. 
She went to community meetings and always had a lot to say. 
If her husband could do it, so could she. 
She didn’t hold a job, exactly, but she was always busy with something or other. 
She was not what you would call beautiful at first glance. 
She was not exactly plain, either. 
She was a woman and carried herself as a woman without her appearance being questioned or her character coming under scrutiny. 
She was the preacher’s wife and she had integrity. 
Mrs. 
Carmichael had a reputation in the parent teachers association, mother’s against drunk drivers, and the Red Hat Society.
The good reverend has spilled his drink. 
The glass lands on the floor and does not break. 
The ice and the scotch blend into the carpet, soaking up and spreading a spot a few inches in diameter. 
 His hands are lax and lazy. 
The drink has calmed him a litter farther than he expected. 
He slumps in his chair and feels his head going numb. 
The muscles in his eyes are feeling strained and heavy. 
He rouses from his chair and stumbles into the bathroom. 
He unzips his pants and lifts up the toilet seat lid. 
He opens the window above and sees an orange glow on the neighbors house. 
He thinks to himself, ‘the sun set hours ago. 
Is it rising already? How long have I been reading? Good lord.’
The preacher takes his empty glass into the kitchen and doesn’t bother to turn off the light. 
He can see clearly in the glow coming from across the street. 
He stares up, mouth open, looking out the windows at his church. 
The flames climb towards heaven. 
The smoke is light and gray against the  ight sky. 
The good reverend drops his glass on the tile floor and watches his parish burn with fire.
Chapter Twenty One:
He pulled in for gas in Ukiah. 
It was a pit stop kind of town. 
Not really the type of place that wants the passers though to linger too long. 
We have enough people. 
Thank you very much for stopping at our gas stations and motels, but really, you should get going. 
Earlier you start the faster you’ll get where you’re going. 
Ukiah has no need for more additions to the population number on the city limits sign. 
The census doesn’t need to take any longer than necessary. 
 Spence fills the tank and walks into the small store that sells items passing for food in plastic wrappers, an assortment of beverages and cigarettes behind the counter. 
The tank is full and he could use some liquid refreshment. 
 He settles on a twelve pack of cheap beer and a few random energy drinks with goofy names and promises well beyond the scope of an over the counter concoction.
Back in the van now empty of bodies. 
Now with a fat wallet and no need to work for a while, Spencer is due for a short vacation. 
 If only because the work isn’t terrible difficult. 
If only because he’s sure to be able to get one or two more between here and Los Angeles. 
If he feels like it. 
If he is so inclined. 
The thought makes Spencer supremely content about his current line of work. 
Work when and where I  eed to, pay is beyond compare. 
Boss is a bit of a freak but that’s not a problem when he only comes around when the call is made. 
And shit man, he pays well. 
Spencer leans on his van and lights a cigarette, watching the numbers climb at the pump. 
 An old woman stares at him, flicking ashes and playing with fire by the fueling station. 
She is aghast. 
She is certainly quite frightened. 
You could say that she was beyond her wits. 
Out of her mind. 
Crazy with disbelief at what her eyes told her brain was happening not so far from where she sat in her Cadillac. 
 She starts yelling at Spencer but he window is up. 
Her lips move behind the glass. 
 Mouthing words such as, “You stupid bastard! You’re going to kill us all. 
Don’t you know you’re at a gas station young man?  Gas station! Fire! You complete idiot. 
How dare you endanger my life and the lives of everyone around us?  How careless! How ridiculous you are!  Why I ought to have to arrested! You should be locked up. 
It’s people like you that make it unsafe to walk the streets at night. 
It’s people like you that make the rest of us hole up in our homes in fear. 
You should be ashamed of yourself, young man!”
Spencer can’t hear any of this. 
His radio is playing loudly and he’s watching some crazy old cunt jabber away, looking at him through her window. 
 He smiles his best fuck you and flicks the butt right at her. 
She jumps back inside her chair, hitting her head on the passenger seat. 
Trying to avoid the cigarette that has to penetrate glass in order to burn her. 
 She doesn’t know that a cigarette will not ignite gasoline fumes unless air is passing rapidly over the cherry. 
A cigarette without a mouth sucking in smoke behind it is simply not hot enough to start a gasoline fire. 
Even the minute increase in temperature from the air flow of a falling cigarette is not enough. 
And the spark has to catch the fumes,  ot the liquid. 
Spencer understand all of this and that’s why he likes to smoke at gas stations. 
Because most people panic and think he’s insane. 
He just has a better understanding of what is and is not actually safe. 
He’s not dead yet. 
And he’s made a hobby out of it.
Spencer turns the volume up higher and sings along loudly to Sweet Home Alabama, pulling out of the gas station and leaving Ukiah behind him for a while. 
Until the next time he wants to go north. 
 Until the next time he feels like taking his job on the road. 
The next time he feels like swimming in an Oregon river and reading the papers for a few more cancer victims. 
He remembers a conversation with Ross about the nature of the work. 
About what, exactly he was getting involved in. 
Spencer tried to listen to everything Ross said, but a lot of it seemed pretty far out. 
Ross said that the bodies of the victims were necessary for the study of how cancer spreads and what causes, stimulates and deters the growths. 
 Then there was a breakthrough sometime last year. 
Sometimes last year Ross wanted Spence to get him as many bodies as he could within a week. 
That was a back breaker. 
So many corpses, so much time and digging and sneaking around the funeral homes. 
It wasn’t an easy job. 
But the amount of time required of him to achieve the financial gains made everything worth the trouble. 
 That week, Spencer earned enough to make the trip west. 
He earned his way to California and made a few grand more on the way. 
Ross said his efforts had earned him a place in history. 
Ross said his contributions to society would never be forgotten. 
Not that Spencer considered saving the lives of cancer patients little more than a hobby. 
Not that Spence would achieve immortality for his other interests. 
The road from here on out was mostly dry grass and hills in the distance. 
Rolling hills with little to offer. 
The road was flat and contained very little in the way of curvature. 
Spencer thanks god he stopped at the taco truck before hitting the freeway. 
When Spencer thanks god, he does so verbally. 
He puts no mind into his thanks. 
He doesn’t think about a god he’s actually thanking for the taco truck being on his route to the on ramp. 
The presence of the taco truck has little if anything to do with any god he’s ever heard of. 
If there were a god of taco trucks, Spence might start paying attention to the idea of god in a slightly more serious manner. 
The concept of god wouldn’t seem nearly as abstract. 
The concept of god might be something a bit more palatable. 
 Something he could swallow. 
Half a burrito resting on in the passenger seat Spencer passes the time in between cities singing along to the radio and smoking or drinking just enough to keep on driving. 
Being alone in a car can be a harrowing experience. 
Driving around the country in a nearly empty van could be disastrously dull. 
The goal is to pay attention. 
The idea is to stay alert and get from a to b without running into anything. 
The goal is a safe trip. 
With no arrests, no tickets, no injuries. 
Right now the only place he wants to get to is Berkeley. 
In Berkeley he can rest for a few days and put his feet up. 
In Berkeley he can find some sanctuary before the long drive down to Los Angeles. 
Highway 101 offers little in the way of distractions. 
The highway ambles along in two to four to six lanes. 
Fluctuating in width but always the same length. 
Spencer drives with a foot on the gas and something to occupy his mouth. 
A cigarette, some food, a beverage, a song. 
Anything to give him something to do besides stare ahead of him. 
He listens to talk radio and wonders where these people come from. 
An expression applying equally to the hosts as well as the callers. 
Who actually calls into these shows to talk to some asshole that invariably cuts them off in order to assert their own opinion with more vigor and less rhetoric than before. 
Where do these people come from? Who said this was ok? Who pays for this kind of crap?  The village was running out of idiots. 
They all got jobs in talk radio.
Every few miles there would be another gas station town. 
The town, it’s self wasn’t anything exciting. 
There were no attractions or reasons to stop there besides rest and fuel and food. 
In between towns. 
Never destinations. 
Spence had to wonder about the people that lived in these towns. 
How do you end up here? What would make anyone want to settle down in a place like this? What kind of life is that? Imagine if you ran a diner in a truck stop kind of town. 
Your clientele would all be familiar and foreign. 
Total strangers just like the last ones. 
All the same breed from your perspective. 
Would this be like living in a small town with amnesia, or playing a part on a TV show where every episode featured a  ew cast, but had the same plot and dialogue?
Spencer looked in front of him and drove along to college radio stations when he could, classic rock when it seemed like a good idea, or just any kind of noise that wasn’t his own, in order to feel like he wasn’t the only source of noise and life in the van. 
The lack of a corpse to talk to made him feel a little silly when he caught himself holding a one sided conversation. 
 Empty body bags make shitty company. 
Spencer turned the radio dial to National Public Radio. 
A little  ews would do him some good.
A plot was uncovered for an attempt at assassination on the president’s life. 
A village no one ever went to visit was at war with a neighboring village for reasons no one will ever understand enough to the point of being able to prevent. 
The economy was falling rapidly. 
The world at large seemed to spiral out of control. 
But that’s the news for you. 
Truth is, not that much has really changed. 
There are no end times rapidly approaching. 
Everything changes in order to stay the same. 
I’m pretty sure that’s a quote. 
I’m pretty sure someone said that before, but I can’t remember who and I honestly don’t have the kind of time to look that up right now. 
Point is, that’s not an original thought. 
Point being, neither is anything else.
The book of Revelations was written by a man that was high on psychedelic mushrooms. 
This is  ot entirely his fault. 
He was exiled to an island where they were a  atural foodstuff. 
Naturally he consumed a great many and took to writing a book that seemed fantastic a thousand or so years ago. 
Nowadays we would have simpley thrown the bastard in jail with the other lunatics that spouted impossible jargon or unbelievable stories. 
In those days they made people like that doctors or shamans or prophets. 
They believed there was something worth noting that they had to say. 
Now we take it for the ramblings of a drug induced hysteria. 
The same people that decided this was a drug induced hysteria are the same people that believe every word in the book of Revelations. 
Spencer checks his speedometer and it only wavers slightly. 
He’s been maintaining speed for some time. 
Waiting until Santa Rosa and one last pit stop before the bay area. 
He’s waiting to see the sign that welcomes him back to the north end of one of the largest urban areas in the United States. 
Once he hits Santa Rosa, he’ll have about an hour before he arrives in Berkeley. 
 And when he arrives in Berkeley he needs to be sure to find Bitchnuts.
Bitchnuts is one of those people you only stumble upon if you really want to. 
He’s not your normal , average guy. 
He has a different set of ambitions in life. 
He has a different code of conduct, separate system of value, and an altogether not so average outlook on what he expects of other people. 
Finding Bitchnuts is a matter of combing the hangout spots. 
To say that Bitchnuts is waiting for you implies that you have something of great value. 
Bitchnuts doesn’t just give out his number. 
His number has to be earned. 
That could take years. 
Spence doesn’t have his number yet. 
He’s on the waiting list. 
Be he knows where to look. 
There’s a collection of bars or cafes he’s been known to frequent. 
There are various street corners where his presence is equally admired and feared. 
If he can’t be found in body, then word of him will certainly circulate at The Infoshop—a kind of anarchist community center.
Bitchnuts is what you might call a capitalist anarchist. 
He believes in the existence of the market, that the market have no rules, no protection, no governance. 
That the people distribute, sell, buy and take at will and negotiate between themselves like civilized human beings. 
Or uncivilized if that’s the way it has to be. 
Many people would classify Bitchnuts as a hustler. 
This is a gross oversimplification. 
This is far from a decent description of Bitchnuts. 
We should begin at how Bitchnuts earned his name.
In his early days as an instigator, Bitchnuts was known to cause a ruckus or two. 
He had a reputation he felt compelled to live up to. 
He was a known dealer and something of a pimp. 
He had just started running girls and found the money quite satisfactory. 
Between the dope and hookers, Bitchnuts was pulling some serious clout around the city. 
His reputation spread and word got around to other people in his line of work. 
The other pimps wanted to keep him at bay but he continued to gain power via street corners. 
His influence seemed unstoppable. 
One of the other pimps had an idea to ruin the rep. 
He figured he could embarrass Bitchnuts off the streets a little. 
 Put a little mistrust in the customer. 
He found a working girl that had once been a working boy. 
She still had the balls to prove it, being one more surgery away from the transition. 
The ranks of Bitchnuts’ girls were infiltrated by a pair of stealth testicles. 
Upon discovery of the intrusion, Bitchnuts went a little crazy. 
He ordered all his girls off the streets at once. 
He was going to investigate each and every one of them. 
He was going to get to the bottom of this. 
He was going to find out “how many of these bitches had nuts.” The original was found three days later floating in the harbor. 
The police didn’t seem to care too much about dead hookers. 
Especially dead hookers with balls and tits.
Spence always regarded Bitchnuts to be an essential stopping point while visiting the Bay Area. 
A visit without Bitchnuts was like spending the longest summer day deep in a cave. 
A visit to Bitchnuts also ensured replenishing his stock of cannabis. 
Bitchnuts was a good dealer if you were good to him. 
He ensured his product and that could be taken to mean you always got your money’s worth. 
Depending on how much your money was worth to Bitchnuts.
The sign on the road contains pictograms showcasing the upcoming attractions such as food, shelter, gas, and so much more. 
Welcome to Santa Rosa. 
The Saintly Rose of a city. 
Nestled right before the state gets interesting. 
Last major city before the sprawl begins. 
One more hour and it’s going to be nonstop urban, concrete and steel, never ending sidewalks, light rails, buses, subways, skyscrapers, subdivisions, billboards, billboards, billboards.
Santa Rosa wants you to spend as much money as you can before you lose it all in the big city. 
Santa Rosa is hoping that you will stop and spend the night in one of the many hotels or motels. 
This would be an ideal place to stop for gas and a cup of coffee. 
Maybe sit down, have a decent meal. 
You’ve been on the road for a while and a little break would do you good. 
That sounds nice, doesn’t it? A little break, maybe some pie and coffee. 
Fill the tank up. 
Spend another hundred dollars for a room for the night. 
That’s not too much to ask now, is it? Santa Rosa is your friend. 
Santa Rosa just wants to make sure you have a safe trip.
Spence understands all of this and takes the off ramp. 
He could use a full tank. 
He could use a decent meal. 
But he’s not going to stay overnight. 
That’s asking a little too much. 
Besides he’s only an hour away. 
There’s really not much point in stopping  ow. 
The sun is making towards the horizon like a desperate man approaching a pretty girl at a bar that’s had a little too much to drink. 
The onset of dusk is as sure as waking up in a strange bed from a black out drunken night. 
You will wake up in a unfamiliar room, surrounded by cats and a neurotic man that wears pajamas to bed with a strange woman. 
Spencer pulls into a diner of entirely typical characteristics. 
There’s a rotating display case featuring a wide selection of pies to choose from. 
There’s a counter with an indifferent girl standing behind it. 
She looks up and looks bored at Spencer as he ambles up the counter for a menu and directions for a place to sit. 
Most of the seating will be open for occupation. 
Spencer takes a corner booth with a good view of the parking lot. 
Night is coming in quickly and the scene will change in the city. 
The attitude will shift into a new mode. 
The people will be night people, the ones that wake up when everyone else is going to sleep.
Spencer barely looks over the menu. 
He came here for pie and coffee and that’s all he plans on getting. 
That the diner serves breakfast all day is of little interest. 
As long as they serve pie right now. 
That’s all that matters. 
A girl that can’t be more than twenty five or less than nineteen approaches.
“Hey, I’m Kate.” She has a name tag and everything in case you forget. 
“Did you need a little more time or have you decided? Would you like to start with something to drink?”
“Hi Kate, I’m Spencer. 
And no, I don’t think I’ll be  eeding anymore time. 
The menu wasn’t of much use to me. 
See, I came here for some pie and coffee and that’s all I want. 
Just a pie and a lot of coffee.”
“Well, alrighty then. 
Do you know what kind of pie you’d like?”
“That butter pecan looks excellent. 
How do you feel about it?”
“Honestly, I haven’t had much of our pies. 
I’m more of an eggs and steak kind of girl.”
“I see. 
Well, is it worth it, do you think? Getting a whole butter pecan pie and washing it down with a bunch of coffee.” 
“That doesn’t sound half bad. 
I mean, I couldn’t see that as an entirely bad set of circumstances to be thrown into. 
Pie and coffee are mighty tasty.”  The waitress flicks her hair out of her face. 
She let the hair drift there for the specific purpose of being able to twist her head rapidly, throwing a few strands out there. 
Like waving a flag for attention. 
She found that flicking her hair had increased her tip percentage. 
She found the results greatly in her favor. 
Little tricks like that always helped. 
Kate writes down pecan and coffee on her ticket. 
She takes the ticket to the counter and tears the page from her note book. 
The pie is removed from a refrigerator in the back and cut into equal slices. 
Whole pies have their own type of plate to be presented on. 
Much more grandiose then their single slice counter parts. 
Kate fetches a whole carafe of coffee and brings both items to the table. 
Spencer waits with hungry eyes.
He starts into the pie with a spoon, taking large mouthfuls and washing them down half chewed with hot, black coffee. 
He chews just enough to swallow and continues ravenously for while in this manner. 
 The coffee cup is refilled every few minutes. 
Spencer chews while looking out the window at the sun setting behind the Pacific Ocean, just past the horizon. 
He looks at the nearby hills being bathed in the half light of dusk. 
An hour from now, he thinks. 
An hour from now and we’ll be back in the bay. 
This should be fun.
Chapter Twenty-Two:
Being an old woman means you have certain privileges. 
Being old usually means garnering the respect of those that are younger and less experienced with life. 
Being old means you’ve had to deal with a lot of shit for a long time and now you’ve earned the right to rest a while and take it easy. 
Being old only means this if you have a retirement plan. 
Otherwise you’re left to go crazy and wander the streets with an impressive collection of garbage bags filled with total nonsense. 
Someone in the suburbs, an old woman lives off the ghost of her husband. 
His money is still alive and that’s all that’s keeping Juniper Gladstone off the streets. 
Juniper is frowning at her meager garden. 
The daffodils have been misbehaving lately. 
They tend to droop and sag and wilt. 
Too heavy for their stems or the stems are too weak to hold them up anymore. 
She suspects that the devil is starting to get to her flowers.
She suspects that the devil is acting through her yard maintenance man. 
The devil is lifting a bottle of gin to his lips and causing him to forget when and how much to water everything. 
The devil is making certain sections of the lawn grow faster than others. 
Juniper frowns at her garden and begins to wonder about exorcism. 
She wanders around the garden and wonders about how productive having an exorcism in her garden would be. 
 She saw on the news how another church not too far from her had gone up in flames. 
She was convinced there was a devil pulling strings. 
Decent people just didn’t going around burning churches. 
That’s just not something people do. 
If decent people had started burning churches, we were all doomed. 
 Who knows where they would stop. 
Rape and murder were not far away at that point. 
The point where someone decides to burn a church down.
Juniper wanders around the garden with a mug of tea and looks at her flowers in various states of decay. 
The gardenias are starting to droop. 
The bulbs are beginning to bruise and slack off. 
The roses are looking like a valentine that was left in the display window along with a note that no one bothered to sign. 
The lilacs and lilies have turned into brown compost. 
The daises have given up on life. 
The snapdragons have gone south. 
The garden is a tribute to the macabre. 
Juniper frowns and looks at her garden and wonders about the Satanists and how far they will go. 
The clouds have started to settle around her ranch house. 
Gathering right over her, it seemed. 
What was once a beautiful day has become a subdued grey, heavy with foreboading and inkling undercurrent of terrible things to come. 
Juniper looks up and squints at the sky. 
Her slack floral print dress doesn’t feel so warm any more. 
She drinks her tea and frowns, furrowing her brow and growing more discontent with her surroundings by the minute. 
Standing in her garden and taking note of the rot and decay around her, Juniper wanders what god is thinking. 
How could he let this happen. 
She tithed. 
She attended every service. 
When the charities came around knocking on her door, looking for donations, she was never stingy. 
What had she ever done that was unfavorable in god’s eyes? 
The rain started softly, in drops and a few lazy sprinkles. 
Down came everything the clouds couldn’t hold. 
Juniper stood in the rain, unmoving, drinking her tea and scowling at her garden. 
She stood in her garden for twenty minutes, letting every drop hit her grey hair, her wrinkled face, her floral print dress and the dead flowers. 
Juniper decided that the growing apathy of the world around her needed to stop. 
She needed to wake up the people around her from the growing threat of the Satanists, the devil worshippers. 
The misguided youth. 
Juniper Marie Gladstone was certain that her last remaining days on earth were meant to serve as a wake up call to the world. 
She would show them the dangers of straying from the good path. 
She would take the devil and put him on a pedestal for everyone to see. 
She wouldn’t hide anything. 
The truth had to be told. 
The lies had to come out of the woodwork. 
Juniper would not rest until she did everything in her power to stop the evils of the world from spreading any further. 
She was on a mission from god.
Chapter Twenty Three:
The sign glowed iridescent in the hazy overcast lazy Sunday afternoon. 
The sign read Palm Reader and large neon hand with fingers spread out, symbols of multiple meanings covered the fingers. 
Beecher crosses the street and stands in front of the window. 
 He looks at the palm and tries to see past it, into the shop. 
There’s only a staircase going up a flight, into the unknown. 
He finds the idea strange and a little intriguing. 
Could someone explain my past and predict my future by the lines in my hands? Was it possible that a record of my traits, my tendencies, my patterns were contained between my fingers and thumbs? It had a romantic notion. 
There was something that suggested it was possible. 
Maybe it was all cold reading and bullshit. 
An elaborate put on. 
A shysters game to take money from fools. 
But if you didn’t have any money, there was nothing to lose. 
Just time and the ramblings of someone that may or may not have been related to gypsies.
The word gypsy is a bastardization of Egyptian. 
And Egypt is supposedly where a lot of hubbub started, back in the day. 
It’s be theorized that the tarot came from Egypt originally. 
And the tarot turned into the deck of cards popularized by Hoyle and his host of parlor games and later, becoming casino profits. 
The Egyptians were said to possess a knowledge of the afterlife and an in depth spiritual understanding that has yet to be surpassed and will forever be imitated by all the great religions. 
There are bits and pieces of Egyptian spirituality everywhere. 
They were a people always intent on what was going to happen next. 
Until there were no more Egyptians. 
Supposedly they dispersed after the whole Moses and Jew debacle. 
Some fleeing to  orthern Europe. 
Some wandering east to Tibet and China. 
Some may have landed in South America and mingled with the Mayans, implanting wacky ideas about the cosmos into their indigenous brains. 
They may be responsible for the original recipe for hot chocolate, which involved the menstrual blood of a virgin instead of sugar to soften the bitterness of raw cacao beans. 
Beecher decided to wander up Telegraph a ways and track down Roy One Eye. 
Roy was as good a source as any for information and possibly a little hash. 
Possible always more. 
Roy One Eye couldn’t hide very easily. 
He kinda stood out. 
He sorta stuck out like a dog boner at a cat show. 
Roy One Eye had one eye tattooed on his forehead. 
His eyes were headlights a mile away down a straight mountain tunnel. 
Distant sources of light from far away. 
Roy was mostly meat. 
His face framed his eyes like a side of beef. 
Like two candles floating in the low water of a well made from raw hamburger. 
His body hung at his sides like salami in a deli window. 
His fingers were sausages and his legs were Christmas hams. 
Roy always has his one eye open and the other two closed. 
He sleeps in between the doorway of a shop that has boarded up windows. 
He had a blanket until yesterday. 
Someone stole it while he was looking for a quiet place to shit.
Beecher walks up to Roy One Eye and knocks five times one the wall by his head. 
Roy knocks a few times and Beecher response following and deviating slightly, toying with his rhythm. 
Noodling around with his jam. 
Playing with his concept of a pattern. 
Roy One Eye looks up, that is, he faces Beecher’s general direction.
“Hey man. 
Where the hell have you been? Beecher, I thought you were dead.”
“Not quite yet, man. 
I’m still ticking. 
They haven’t stopped me yet. 
What have you been up to Roy?
“Oh you know, sitting around, bullshitting. 
Listening to the odd bits that float my way. 
How about yourself? It’s been like a few years. 
 You must have had had a few interesting experiences.”
“Oh, some things happened. 
Some things didn’t happen. 
It’s been a while.”
“Man, the last time I saw you, there were students, and they were uppity about something or other.”
“Yeah, they tend to be excitable. 
Comes and goes.”
“So man, what brings you around? You’re not one to roam without an intended goal.”
“Most times, yeah. 
Most times. 
This time I just felt like it was a good day to be in Berkeley.”
“That sounds about right. 
It is a good day in Berkeley. 
I got word this morning about a music festival going down in People’s Park. 
Sounds like a good time. 
People having a good time. 
Rocking out. 
Eating spaghetti. 
You heard about this?”
“Yeah, man. 
I was just up there. 
There’s a depressing sort of group up there. 
I don’t really know. 
There was a very depressing sort of boy that tried to talk to me. 
But all he wanted was a cigarette and the sound of his own voice. 
I had to leave. 
I’m sure you understand.”
“Yeah, man. 
I dig. 
I mean is. 
How was the music?”
“Oh well, I left before the music even got started. 
I’m sure they’ve finished setting up by now. 
They must be pretty much underway.”
“A spaghetti feed? And music. 
Well, I got an idea. 
You haul my blind ass to the park and I’ll make it worth your while. 
I could use some music and a nice place to sit down. 
And a belly full of spaghetti.”
“Ah shit man. 
That ain’t no problem. 
I can do that. 
Hell, I was thinking about heading in that direction after the music got started anyway. 
Seemed like a great idea. 
And I mean, hey, free spaghetti.”
“Yeah, free spaghetti. 
I could use some food.”
“Alright, old man. 
Let’s wheel you back around.”
Beecher takes Roy One Eye and hauls him to his feet. 
He takes the large meaty man and props him up against his wanderer’s frame. 
Back out from the alcove. 
Balancing on Beecher’s boney legs. 
They make an intriguing three legged race. 
Their ankles are not tied, but they might as well be. 
they hobble down the straight and  arrow path way back to the park. 
On the way Beecher see’s the palm reader.
“You mind if I prop you down in a chair and get my fortune told?  It’s been a while.” 
Roy One Eye nods with lids closed. 
The nod could be interoperated as ‘Yes sir, I do in fact mind a great deal. 
You shouldn’t be talking to fortune tellers when you’re supposed to be taking be to the park, so that I might rest against a wall, with a mouth full of noodles and a head full of jam. 
That sounds like a reasonable culmination of event in my life that has lead to the conclusion of where I should be right now; that sounds like the kind of place that I would end up given the culmination of the path my life has taken thus far.’
Beecher walks the cripple down Telegraph. 
Temporarily deterred by the food ideal. 
Looking over his shoulder at each blinking sign and each red light. 
The two of them hobble along, three legged racing down Telegraph. 
They make their way in front of the palm reader and Beecher calls halt. 
Beecher calls for a stop in their progression. 
Roy One Eye has a choice to either wait in the stiff chaired waiting room, or outside on the sidewalk. 
The sidewalk is much more agreeable.
Beecher walks up a flight of wood base on concrete steps. 
He turns towards the only door offered to him and knocks a few times in slow succession. 
The door opens a crack and an old woman’s eye answers him.
“Hello,” she says, “What brings you here?”
“I seek the light, and what lies beyond.”
“Well then, give me a second.” The door closes in Beecher’s face. 
He pictures the town psychic tidying up her séance room in order to finally get some business. 
She’s a filing all the lost socks at the laundry mat away under false hopes and misguided dreams. 
The door opens a few moments later. 
A woman wearing far too many bracelets answers the door. 
She may have been the woman that originally shut the door in his face. 
But there is no time for such contemplation. 
 Beecher enters the apartment. 
Beecher has climbed the stairs. 
All he can expect right now, is how a stranger will interoperate his future.
The steps become larger with each movement of the foot. 
The length between stretches of the leg becomes longer with each shift in cardiovascular dynamics. 
The last door is reached and the woman that answers does so with frilly, out of control hair and a demeanor of cosmic indifference. 
The woman behind the curtain is obviously trying to get by. 
She doesn’t have a nine hundred number or an addresses that will make her popular on late night television. 
She’s the kind of genuine physchic that I have been advising people I have known my whole life from seeing. 
Mostly because I fear what will happened when people I have known my whole life go out and seek the truth. 
But the palm reader is a reliable source. 
She expects nothing except ten dollars. 
And you should expect nothing except a ten dollar evaluation of your existence. 
 That’s the kind of attitude the Beecher had upon entering the palm reader’s building. 
Or should I say, having been dragged into the palm reader’s building by the woman in question herself. 
 She lived above a failed dollar store.
That should say enough. 
The failed psychic lived above the dollar store, but the store failed and the psychic remained in business. 
That was how Berkeley operated. 
Find a new guru, ignore the old one. 
Everyone you met in Berkeley had already been down the road you were thinking of traveling. 
Therefore they served a simultaneous purpose of being a source of knowledge and storytelling, while fulfilling the duel purpose of being a source of entertainment. 
 This was especially apparent in the bars or Berkeley. 
The Palm reader invited Beecher upstairs. 
Despite his economic display. 
Despite the fact that all Beecher had to offer society was advice and words of warning. 
The old woman began flipping over cards, feeling around Beecher’s palm for signs of validation to the lines she read in his palm. 
“Your palm tells me that you have lived a rich life.”
“Well yeah, I suppose. 
I Went along the rail and met quite a few characters that little or much to help me out. 
I continued to seek and looked everywhere for an answer. 
Then the students began doing the same thing. 
Then I turned to uppers and downers and whatever else came my way and found a kind of balance. 
I found out who I was and which chemicals I responded to in a positive or negative manner.”
The lady continues, “You palm tells me that you have ideals, which remain stagnant inside of you. 
That you have been called to a higher purpose which you refuse to accept. 
Instead you wander around the wayside. 
Looking for distraction. 
Hoping for some kind of disillusionment that will allow you to overcome your present circumstances. 
You will continually be at odds with your inner most desires until you learn to confront the fact that you are a leader, and that you have the drive to lead people to a better understanding of their lives. 
You have been holding back, waiting for your day to come when you never realized that your day was already here. 
 You  eed to take hold of today and turn it into the day you finally realize your destiny. 
When you take charge of the machine.”
Beecher digs out two dollars in quarters. 
He figures that’s worth the price of the future. 
 He hears the melody to Dark Star and limps Roy to People’s Park for a better earshot view of the goings on. 
The concert and spaghetti feed is in full effect. 
People have gathered from all walks of the Bay Area experience. 
The idea of free pasta brought them here. 
The sound of original intent reminded them of years long past. 
 On stage was a band consisting of only two guitar players and a drummer. 
The Drummer seemed to be stabilizing the rhythm as opposed to setting it. 
He listened and adapted to the change of the guitar. 
The citizens of the park continued on, sleeping on logs and milling about in the garden. 
The students with less to do, wandered in to the garden and tried to follow their way back to the original melody. 
They traveled far and wide to see a consistent point of view. 
To actualize something greater then themselves. 
They took buses and trains. 
They checked Craig’s List for rideshares. 
The criss crossed the country in search of something to belong too. 
Just something with a loud voice and lots of hooting and hollering. 
Just a place to feel safe screaming your lungs out at the slightest change, be it for good or bad or just someone’s honest mistake. 
That’s all that mattered. 
Participation numbers. 
Get enough people to join the cause, and suddenly you have a congregation. 
Suddenly you have a following. 
Now what? Do you steer them onto the path of self fulfillment or the path of a higher power leading them in the morally right, safe to raise children kind of environment. 
That’s not so bad. 
I mean really. 
Of all the things people could be raising their kids to be, at least they’re not violent revolutionaries that would cut off my hands because I bought a cup of Starbucks’ coffee back in the day and completely forgot about the whole experience. 
Or maybe it happened multiple times and I failed to see the connection. 
The point is. 
The point being. 
That I forgot what it was like to be in Beecher’s position. 
Half drunk, half a bum in the chair of a beauty school short timing. 
“So, like. 
How short are we talking?” She holds a clipper and a pair of scissors. 
She’s ready to do some damage. 
She’s been holed up in beauty school long enough to go mad. 
She wants to really cut some hair. 
She wants to lay down the law on someone’s scalp. 
She has the skills. 
She’s one month away from graduation.
“Well,  ot quite a month. 
Might take a little longer. 
I have a few loose ends to tie up. 
I have a few more tests.”
“Don’t worry about it. 
You’ll do fine. 
If you need me to be here as a shining example of your work then so be it. 
I’m more than happy too.”
Beecher was not so lucky. 
Beecher leaves the shop, refusing to pay for his hair cut. 
Complaining about incompetence on behave of the bartenders, the bouncers, and the other barflies. 
He accuses them all of hypocrisy, which is impressive enough. 
This demographic is such that it has committed it’s self to none whatsoever. 
Beecher looks across the street and sees a sign for an up and coming bread and cheese shop. 
He thinks, well, there’s a return to ideals. 
There’s a business plan set on the idea of human understanding. 
The concept of sustainability is typically only accessible to those who can afford it.
Beecher wheels Roy to a suitable spot and leaves with promises of spaghetti upon his return. 
Beecher approaches the table, long clothed in white, burdened with large bowls full of spaghetti. 
Acting as over dramatic paper weights to the light autumn breeze of early November. 
The sauce sits in separate bowls and Beecher goes to smother his two plates with enough sauce to compliment each serving of noodles. 
He asks where the jam is located and each time he’s pointed in the direction of the stage.
A band has been playing for the last few hours, showing no sign of stopping or slowing down. 
The band has called themselves C.O.R.P.S.E. 
and consist of two guitar players and a drummer. 
The drummer only acts as a stabilizing element to the call and response jam band esthetics of the two guitar players. 
They drift around from blues to blue grass to country folk and classic rock and roll. 
They continually drift. 
That seems to be a suitable way to sum up their musical activity. 
Always in transition from one movement to another. 
Always moving forward or backwards. 
From past influence to present prediction to social commentary. 
The  otes always seemed to fall somewhere around there. 
Never quite beyond, never quite hitting accurately. 
That’s how CORPSE played. 
And they played a mean set. 
The three of them would keep going until a member of another band that was supposed to be up next joined in. 
He would start up and the rest of his band would follow suit until CORPSE would fade off stage, only to return to fill the silence when  eeded, never being a full stop or a conclusive undertaking. 
At People’s Park that day, hundreds of kids gathered, a bunch of hold over hippies lived again in the days of their youth. 
The possibilities were once again, endless. 
The potential was once again, revitalized. 
 The idea that the world was really as malleable as we once believed. 
The idea that total world peace wasn’t just a pipe dream. 
The idea that true benefits could be felt along all walks of life, no matter how spread out and difficult and different they were. 
There was always a chance of reconciliation. 
There was always the hope of a new beginning. 
No matter how bad and how turbulent events around us seemed, we could, in fact, overcome. 
Choosing to either overcome or maintain the status quo. 
The status quo was easy enough. 
We had to change, virtually, nothing about anything. 
Just continue the same patterns despite circumstances. 
Pretend that the present shift in politics meant nothing to any of us. 
That’s all that was required of us to keep on keepin’ on and that’s what most of us did. 
We still punched in to our day jobs. 
We still collected our checks. 
We still slept and left home at hours, coinciding with the time we had to be present at places of employment, no matter how fulfilling they happened to be. 
Beecher listened to the band play and mouthed a mouth full of spaghetti. 
He listened and contemplated the direction and outcome of everything that was happening around him. 
Beecher chewed his noodles and eyed the stage, thinking about the gift from Roy One Eye. 
The gift of a few fun guys. 
The idea OF A couple of  ow digesting mushrooms making their way into conscious reality. 
If the mushrooms were right than moving out of the city was the only viable alternative. 
If the mushrooms were right then the only means of reconciliation were to consume, experience and report. 
Like a coming of age ritual for the disenfranchised. 
Beecher listened to the band for what seemed like a long time. 
He was noticibly stoned. 
Upon entering People’s Park he was greeted with the alternative of staying sober or mingling with the crowd. 
The Crowd already seemed sufficiently baked. 
 There was no need to stimulate farther. 
But a room to cook dinner in. 
It had been a while.
Beecher walked down Telegraph a ways and decided to walk back up to Sproul. 
He wanted to get a good long look at the University. 
He wanted to see the tower rise above the fog and shine over the existence of how many years he had been alive. 
Or how many years he had walked the earth. 
He wanted a land mark or a light mark to signal that he wasn’t exactly that old. 
That he was still growing. 
That there was still more to do. 
Beecher wanders into the restroom at People’s Park and looks at himself in the mirror.
The image that greets Beecher isn’t one of grandiose appeal or social acceptance. 
He has not the face of a revolutionary or a social figure that will lead the people to greatness. 
His eyes are too soft. 
His countenance is too flimsy. 
He could be either the hero or the arch villain. 
One of the two, but neither the middle man. 
He is too extreme to be caught in between.
Beecher eyes him wearily. 
As if he might Bogart his position in life. 
As if he might be the milkman that no one forgot. 
Beecher is content to live forever. 
Beecher has finally accepted his role as permanent figure in the drama of life on planet earth. 
Beecher has eaten half a pound of psychedelic mushrooms and decided to look in the mirror to see what’s new.
In the mirror his beard is the same. 
There’s the same shaggy length coupled with the growth of a few weeks entangled in the ritual of neglected threads. 
Where each hair finds a new path to grow on. 
Where each hair finds a new place to live for a while. 
Beecher sees himself in the mirror and thinks, ‘my god, I could use a bit of a haircut, maybe a shave.’
Chapter Twenty-Four.
“Well, shit, what do you make of it? This shit is pretty fucking close to home. 
I don’t like it. 
This is getting a bit out of hand, Pete.”
Pete looks at the smoldering ashes. 
The half burned beams with once upon a time white paint flecking to the ground in piles near the foundation. 
He wears a scowl like a winter coat. 
Close to the neck, drawn up tight and pulled close. 
He looks a bit pissed off at the wreckage.
“Hey Reverend. 
How old did you say this parish was? I mean, how long have you been here? Long enough to have enemies? Did your church do anything like picket Planned Parenthood?”
Rev. 
Carmichael stares through the smoke screen of what used to be his church. 
He looks right through the debris. 
He looks ten years into the past and five years into the future simultaneously. 
His face is as readable as Sanskrit to a two year old. 
Words dance around near the tip of his tongue but nothing is going to sound quite right at the moment. 
His whole life up until this point has officially been destroyed. 
There is nothing left except the house he lives in. 
Without a church to maintain, without a family to provide for. 
He’s a finished man. 
“No. 
I mean, I don’t think so. 
The enemies of the lord and what not…” He trails off and stares again right through and onward. 
Detective Addison looks the good reverend up and down. 
Years of cop school, psychology classes, profiling, evidence, years of looking people up and down for a hint of some kind of malice, a clue, a lead, something to go on. 
The good reverend is not an easy read. 
He seems to be avoiding readability. 
He might be a more than a little shell shocked. 
“Well, if you can think of any reason, anything at all, that might have lead to this. 
Let us know. 
We’re available any time, any day. 
We’ve been on this case for a month or more now.”
Reverend Carmichael takes a business card and continues looking at nothing in general. 
He says thanks like listening to an echo from last week. 
The reverend isn’t in right now. 
Please leave a message. 
He’ll get back to you as soon as possible. 
Beep.
Addison extracts a cigarette and lights up. 
The time and place seem just right for a cigarette. 
He has a lot on his mind. 
He’s seen the case files from a dozen or so similar incidents. 
This is the first time he’s been face to face with the real deal. 
The ashes and smoke and timber and coals and the good reverend watching the remains of his life smolder and die right in front of him. 
The actuality of the case now firm and present in his mind. 
He knew this day would arrive. 
He had a good gut instinct. 
One of those things that makes being a detective possible. 
He’s trying to tie all the angles together. 
He’s trying to make some kind of sense of all the clues. 
Pete Templeton is wandering around the wreckage, kicking at remains and seemingly lost without someone to bully into answers. 
“Hey Pete, I’ve seen enough here. 
You got any ideas?”
“Nothing at the moment. 
I might have something. 
This does look like a group effort. 
But still. 
No calling card. 
Very strange for a hate crime. 
No nothing to remember anyone by. 
Say preacher, no threatening letters? No nothing yeah?”
“Yeah,” The good reverend says, “nothing at all. 
Just what’s left of my church.”
“I see.” Pete says, kicking a still burning ceiling beam.
“Let’s get out of here. 
Try and make some sense of this mess back at the station.” Addison flicks the butt of his cigarette into the ashes.
“Alright.” Pete heads back to the patrol car.
“Well, look Rev. 
We’ve been on this case for a while. 
Lots of background but this is the first local incident. 
Let us know if you hear anything.”
“I will. 
I’ll keep you informed of any developments on my end.”
Chapter 25:
“You’re pathetic.”
“C’mon sis. 
Help me out here.”
“The kind of help you need involves my foot and your snatch.”
“But what should I do? Roscoe’s still in jail. 
Like, should I visit him? Will they arrest me if I walk in there?”
“Figure it out, Lars. 
Seriously. 
I can’t make decisions for you. 
If I were you, I’d just leave him there. 
He got in, he’s going to have to get out. 
His problems are not your problems. 
Deal. 
How’s Berkeley? How’re my boys?”
“Madness. 
I think the boys are starting an army or a cult. 
Or a band. 
I don’t know. 
All these kids drop by. 
They call them gromits. 
The gromits buy lots of weed though. 
I’ve just been cooking and cleaning and walking to the black sand beach.”
“That sounds nice.”
“There’s no sand at the black sand beach! Just rocks!”
“Sounds like something The Shambles would say.”
“Is that actually his name? Why is he called The Shambles?”
“Dude, he is shambility. 
And The Mess is a mess.”
“Right. 
Of course. 
How stupid of me.”
“Pretty much.”
“Thanks Marji.”
“Anytime. 
Look, I gotta run. 
Figure it out. 
Deal. 
You’ll be fine.”
“Alright, bye.”
What a swell sister. 
Couldn’t ask for a better one if there was a catalog and all the big sisters were barcoded with make and model numbers and everything. 
I was already walking around in the suburbs, heading northish. 
I took a mean right and wound up on San Pablo. 
San Pablo is one of those streets that stretches in a straight line across counties. 
There’s a pattern or a poem written in stone brick mortar of motor car repair. 
Maybe more of a mantra. 
Brakes. 
Transmission. 
Tires. 
Brakes. 
Transmission. 
Tires. 
Smog. 
Smog. 
Smog. 
The pattern is broken by the odd restaurant. 
The exceptional corner store. 
A church or two. 
I’ve walked down San Pablo in the late afternoon enough times to memorize the placement. 
I’m intimately familiar with cracks in the paint. 
The billboards that offer me nothing.
Geographically, I pass through African America, two blocks of Mexico, and if I went all the way to the corner of University, I’d be in India. 
The late autumn, later afternoon sun pulls the shadows out of and stretches them against the sidewalk. 
Question: What’s red and black on a white background? Answer: The sign in front of the Acme Bar. 
The door is open and right now seems like a great time for booze and contemplation.
My eyes adjust to the light or lack thereof. 
Most of the bar stools are empty and that’s fine. 
A wall clock reads four-thirty, but I don’t believe it. 
The man behind the counter is built like a fighter. 
If he wasn’t wearing glasses, I’d mistake him for the door man. 
His tattoos seem like extensions of his shirt sleeves. 
His demeanor is kind and welcoming. 
It’s a whiskey and ice kind of afternoon. 
The other two patrons came with the building. 
There’s a line in the mortgage about them. 
If the bar ever changes hands, the two old men stay with permenantly reserved seating. 
Draft beer in bottomless pint glasses and carte blanche of the rules. 
Except the no smoking before nine rule. 
There’s three no smoking signs and a display box of cigarettes next to the coffee pot. 
Right where it belongs.
“You remember Craig Bloomsdale?” One of the men sets his beer down.
“Face like a Buick?” says the other, lifting his beer to his lips.
“That’s the one!” He picks up his beer again.
“How is that motherfucker?” He sets his glass down.
“Oh, he died.”
“Are you serious?”
“Completely. 
His old lady called me up this morning. 
All tears n’ shit. 
Said he fell over watering the lawn. 
The goddamn lawn. 
Just fell over dead. 
Just kinda gave up on life I guess. 
Poor old Craig.”
“For Craig!”
“For Craig!”
The old timers raise their beers and drain them, setting down their glasses with a polite show of force. 
Just enough enthusiasm for drinking at a place that’s not exactly home. 
Extending the courtesy to handle someone else’s glassware with enough care not to cause problems. 
The old men were their own kind of timeless charm. 
Myself, I preferred my whiskey burn and a good wall to stare at.
Where to go from here? Shall I try to rescue the boy? Blow down the jail and run away to South America? Maybe Canada? Maybe get in touch with the Canadians that put him there in the first place. 
Maybe they could help. 
Maybe I should just abandon him and start over. 
Berkeley wasn’t such a bad town. 
I was beginning to know my way around. 
I now had enough connections to develop my own weed operation. 
And the boys. 
Well, hell. 
What would the boys do without me? I was like their goddamn den mother. 
They’d fall apart without me around. 
I took a long pull off my glass, the ice melting enough to ease the burn. 
Jesus, I thought, I’m turning into a drunk. 
I used to be such a pothead. 
Ah, well. 
No matter. 
You know what? Fuck Roscoe. 
He dug his own hole. 
None of that is my problem. 
Now I’m homeless because of him. 
Let him rot away. 
Might do him good. 
Besides, what did he ever really do for me? What have I ever gained from that pathetic pushover? Homelessness and short term memory loss. 
That’s what. 
Fuck that guy. 
I can get another man. 
I can find another mate. 
We were just used to each other enough. 
That’s all. 
We were comfortable with each other’s shit. 
Marji was right. 
Sis, god bless you. 
I toast my invisible sister and down the hatch, empty glass acrobat that I am. 
And a shot, why not down it goes and god it feels so good to be free fuck that hippie. 
I never liked Phish anyway. 
I look at the clock and the sun is going away for a while. 
Fine with me. 
Fuck the sun. 
Bring on the moon. 
Give me the stars. 
Give me darkness and streetlights. 
Give me mood lighting and whatever.
“Hey! Tats! Shot of Ferny, ginger back. 
Follow with more whiskey on ice. 
Matter of fact. 
How much for the bottle? Cool if I just nurse that bottle by myself. 
I might as well. 
That bottle and me, we’re best friends. 
We go way back. 
That bottled and me used to sit in parking lots together while you lazy fucks,” and here I point at everyone in the room, all three of them, “You lazy fucks went to school. 
Fuck you, guy.” 
I take a nice pull and make whiskey face when I come back around. 
The barman comes over a little concerned, a little amused. 
I ain’t the toughest looking bitch in the world. 
“You doing alright miss? Need a cab or something? Kinda early for that talk.” He takes the bottle away from me and puts it back on the shelf. 
He also takes my empty glass.
“Oh,” I said, “don’t mind me. 
I’m having a midlife crisis. 
I’ve just decided to leave my boy and let fly with life. 
What do I owe you?”
“Fifty and we’re square. 
Sure you don’t need a cab?”
“You’re a sweetheart. 
Really, don’t mind me. 
I need some time alone. 
I might go scream at something that understands me. 
Something like the black sand beach.”
“Suit yourself.”
“There’s no sand at the black sand beach! Only rocks!” I slap money on the counter, tell the old men, “Fuck you!” and laugh and tell them I’m just joking. 
I like this bar. 
I might be back. 
I might not. 
I like this bar.
Chapter One: Two Eggs, Over Seas.
Flights out of Romania are few and far between. 
Flights to San Francisco from Romania are long and expensive. 
The whole of the trip takes a god awful long time. 
There are meals and snacks and beverage services along the way to sustain those seated passengers. 
The meal cart is kreeling down the aisle. 
A woman in uniform stops and steadies the whole thing while a man in similar uniform begins handing out mashed potatoes, roast beef and peas. 
It was made without care and with minimal human contact. 
The potatoes are tasteless . 
There was no one there to check the salt and ensure that proper seasoning measures were taken. 
The potatoes were freeze dried in a powdery state. 
The peas received similar treatment. 
The roast beef is cooked all the way through, dry as a paper towel and about as nourishing. 
 One of these containers lands on the tray table of a woman in her mid forties. 
She has long, wild fire chestnut hair covered by a modest shawl. 
 She looks out like a caged, predatory bird through obsidian black eyes. 
 Her dress was made by her mother near twenty years previous. 
The patterns and cloth are nothing familiar to any urban anywhere. 
 She took forty minutes to make her way past security. 
Her bracelets and anklets, necklaces and earrings sending off beeps and buzzes and the special type of ruckus that puts airports into a search and destroy frenzy. 
Her jewelry was not found to be any type of weapon. 
 Her motives were not found to be any type of threat. 
Most all of her adornments carried one similarity. 
Hints of blue, hints of water. 
Oceanic would be one way to put it. 
Oceanic like her name, which was Mara. 
Mara d’Niles is in row fourteen, seat D, near the window. 
 She was limited to one carry on item and one small bag, her only luggage. 
She’s poking at the peas and bits of potato. 
She picks up the few meager slices of beef and waves them about, trying to make some kind of sense. 
When the lady in the uniform comes back around with the trash bag, she forcefully tosses the food tray downward inside. 
A gesture of both remorse at her wastefulness, and indignation at being served such shit in the name of edibility. 
 She pulls her leather knap sack from the seat in front of her and extracts a small round loaf of black bread. 
She pulls out a small dish of creamed butter and a bit of hen she roasted that morning. 
 Mara flags down the flight attendant every time she passes and keeps her plastic cup of red wine from getting dry. 
She can hold her wine in a way that seems supernatural. 
It’s not until the layover in New York that she begins to exhibit any signs of intoxication. 
 The airport in New York City is a wonderland compared to the airport in Romania. 
Mara exchanges her money for American dollars and finds the closest bar. 
She has a few more hours to go. 
A few more hours until San Francisco. 
She takes out the letter and reads it again.
<Mara Dear,
This may be an odd time, a strange request, and a lot to ask. 
I traced our family tree via several organizations that specialize in that sort of thing. 
As it turns out, you may be my only surviving relative. 
 I’m writing from a bed in a hospital in San Francisco. 
I’ve been diagnosed with a malignant cancer of the brain and have some small amount of time left on this earth. 
My possessions are few. 
Before my extended stay in the hospital I owned and ran a small shop in San Francisco, near the Russians and a few other Romanian families. 
There is a room above that was my residence. 
I should like to meet you and hear stories of the home country. 
Of our parents, of life, of you, yourself. 
I should like very much to pass on the little I have here to someone in the family capable of not letting it go to waste. 
I know leaving your home and any life you have made for yourself would be a difficult, to say the least, ordeal to undertake. 
But I feel you should like it here, there being everything a heart could desire within reach. 
Enclosed you will find directions and instructions to get to the hospital, and the information of a dear friend of mine that I have entrusted the shop to in my absence. 
 Do please get in touch with me soon.
Your sister,
Riva d’Niles
Ps. 
Bring the cards. 
>
Mara folds the letter again and places it with care in a pocket near her breast. 
 She takes out a small pouch of tobacco and a pipe. 
She’s never seen a no smoking sign before. 
She puffs away at the end of the bar for several minutes before the bartender walks over and says,
“Excuse me, ma’m, there’s no smoking in this bar.” 
Mara nods and continues smoking. 
She points at one of the bottles on the shelf. 
The bartender says,
“Ma’m, do you speak English?” She nods again, blowing a thick cloud of smoke to the side.
“This is a non-smoking establishment ma’m. 
 All bars and clubs in New York City are non-smoking. 
You can’t do that here.” He looks tired. 
His job never ends. 
And less people come though that speak and understand English. 
She laughs at him dismissively and points at the bottle again. 
The bartender sighs, points at her pipe and shakes his head with stern connotations of disapproval. 
That pipe is very much not allowed to be smoked here. 
You’re going to have to do that outside. 
 But outside would mean going through security again. 
Unacceptable. 
 She points at the bottle again, and he just hopes she smokes quickly and management doesn’t see her. 
He pours a double rye whiskey, neat. 
The bottle she was pointing at was two to the left. 
It was labeled Romana. 
She thought he could figure it out. 
 She downs the double in one swift motion. 
Hand to glass and liquid in mouth before he has time to say another word. 
She coughs and weezes. 
She exhales loudly and coughs again. 
She smiles at him, real big, showing years of dental neglect.
Katherine Bremmer is buttoning up her vest. 
The only person that called her Katherine was her mother, now two years passed away. 
Now two years buried and funeral over and black ties and suits. 
Now two years and Kat is wearing a black skirt, white shirt, and a black vest. 
She has black shoes with no laces and extra padding. 
 If you want to picture her, she stands about five six, one hundred and thirty pounds on a good day. 
Her mother was Irish and her father German. 
A fair smattering of freckles dot across her skin. 
She jogs on her days off and tries to do crunches while watching afternoon television shows that take place in court rooms. 
Her left eye is hazel sometimes and the right is dark brown always. 
She ties her toasted almond brown hair in a bun behind her head. 
She has a few freckles around her nose, which is slightly upturned. 
If you asked her what she considered to be her best feature, she would without shame, tell you that her ass was near perfect. 
You’d have to ask her after a few drinks, otherwise she’d lie and say something like her teeth, or the dimples that only show up when she’s genuinely happy.
She wanted to travel and dropped out of high school at sixteen. 
She could never save money and worked around town anywhere that didn’t require a diploma. 
At eighteen she enrolled at community college in Santa Rosa. 
She dropped out at age twenty three and took a job as a flight attendant. 
 This is the second airline she’s worked for, and has yet to land any shifts on the internationals. 
The work is routine. 
All of those things that jolt or cause anxiety in the average air traveler can be nullified with repetition. 
Her bosses are seldom seen, the paychecks arrive on time, the coworkers are tolerable. 
She rides on planes and distributes foil wrapped snacks and complimentary beer and wine for a living. 
 In the last year she’s covered most of the Eastern sea board, The Pacific Northwest, and the Houston airport. 
 She pesters her superiors for a flight to China, to Nepal, to anywhere in Europe. 
Hell, even parts of Africa would be ok. 
But all those lay-overs in Chicago, Las Angeles, St. 
Louis. 
They’re getting to her. 
Kat looks in the mirror, and touches up a conservative make-up job. 
She wrinkles her nose and tilts her head back checking for stray hairs. 
Plucking them makes her eyes water. 
She checks her phone for the time and swears at the mirror at Kennedy International Airport, Gate B15-B19 ladies room. 
In her purse is half a pack of mint chewing gum, an unopened pack of nicotine gum, and three Malboro Reds. 
 She might have to break into the nic gum. 
She’s been meaning to quit for the last three years. 
The smell, the cost, the coughs are building up. 
But when it comes down to it, there’s nothing in the world like it. 
That first hit of tobacco in the morning. 
The cigarette after a long flight. 
The five she smokes in between vodka drinks at half the bars in airports around the country. 
The cigarette while laying in bed at a strange hotel near the sound of takeoff and landing, taxi cabs, travelers, red eyes and commuter jets. 
The smoke after a good fuck. 
And how long has it been? The most important cigarette is right after a filling meal. 
That’s the icing on the nicotine cake. 
That’s the one that keeps her from quitting. 
That’s the long bubble bath orgasmic massage cigarette. 
The queen of all smoke breaks. 
Her next flight is going to San Francisco, to that apartment she pays rent on, and a good week off. 
 She pictures her bath robe and matching slippers while hustling to gate B17. 
Her refrigerator is going to need restocking. 
There will be a stack of mail, a stack of bills, and a layer of dust on everything. 
The other flight attendants are standing at the gate waiting. 
Kat waves and the other two just look at each other in understanding. 
Kat has stopped caring what anyone else in the company thinks, as long as she can fly for free out of the country. 
As long as she gets to see the world, everyone else can go to hell. 
She walks right past, not waiting for them to say anything. 
She walks outside, lighter and cigarette at the ready for the second those doors close behind her. 
November air sneaks up and creeps up her skirt, sending a wave of goose bumps down her legs, down her arms. 
New York weather. 
Strictly for New Yorkers. 
Any half decent California girl has the sense to stay the hell out of New York in a skirt in November. 
 Kat is not a decent California girl. 
She smokes in the breeze, holding her free arm close to her body, pulling at her left arm holding the cigarette close to her face. 
There’s a scowl on her face that creates a five foot radius of hatred around her. 
 She stands in her cold bubble smoking, and looking at the plane. 
“As I was saying, Kat,” His name tag reads Mark and he’s another attendant for Sky Boat International Airlines. 
“As I was saying, Kat, are you listening? The flight has been delayed for maybe, 20 more minutes. 
You should probably find your coat. 
And your name tag.” Mark smirks and walks back inside. 
He talks with Sheila and they both look at her and smirk together. 
Kat thinks she could lip read the word bitch cross Sheila’s lips. 
She mouths back, “Fuck you” but no one’s looking at her now.
The cigarette switches hands and she looks at the plane again. 
Always all these delays. 
You’d think with all this experience in air travel we’d have it all down by now. 
You’d think we would have made reliable enough machines by now. 
You’d think we have this whole air travel thing streamlined by now. 
But no. 
No sir. 
There’s not a damn thing streamlined about any kind of travel. 
Kat has spent more time in airports waiting for takeoff then in the air, waiting to land. 
Kat thinks she has spent most of her life waiting. 
She looks at the plane and wonders how many hours were spent in anticipations. 
How many hours in transition. 
How long has she spent in between in betweens? 
Mara has polished off five straight whiskies. 
All bourbon. 
She’s only been in the bar for an hour. 
She hasn’t paid for a single one yet, and laughs every time the bartender tries to coax money out of her. 
The bartender grows more vexed every minute. 
Mara keeps laughing at him. 
He still doesn’t know she has a rather solid grasp on the English language. 
She hasn’t said a word in any language, only pointed and laughed. 
 Mara collects her things together, throws a twenty on the bar top and says,
“Thanks, sweet cheeks.” 
A rather solid grasp. 
Mara meanders down the aisles, making her way to the gate. 
Her next flight is San Francisco with a layover in Chicago. 
She’s feeling the whiskey, the jetlag and the kind of fatigue that can only be generated by hours sitting down on an airplane. 
She stretches by the gate and gets her ticket out. 
Filing past the desk, she hands her ticket to the lady in uniform behind it. 
A barcode is scanned and she walks with everyone else in line to the runway. 
Chapter two. 
Nor Rain, Nor Snow, Nor Sleet, Nor Hash Browns.
The Postal Service has a bad rap. 
I don’t really know why that is. 
I mean, sure, it’s government work, the pay sucks, the hours are long. 
But fuck it, man. 
I walk around for a living. 
Delivering mail is one of those love hate jobs. 
You bring some guy bills to pay, and he hates you. 
You bring people love letters, postcards, refunds, coupons, and Publisher’s Clearing House. 
Those people love you. 
At least they love the mail. 
Being the messenger ain’t that bad. 
The foot work keeps me in reasonable shape. 
I get to meet all aspects of humanity. 
I don’t love my job, per se. 
But I sure as shit don’t hate it. 
My route for the past month has been a suburb gig. 
Little boxes kinda shit. 
Well manicured lawns, fresh clean painted houses. 
Dogs in yards, kids in sprinklers. 
 It’s ‘burbsy. 
One of those houses always has something going on. 
Drunk parents, deviant children. 
And this stoner hippie babysitter named Skip. 
Skip basically lives at the place, at least, she’s there all the time. 
The parents don’t really care what the kids get up to, Skip is there to keep them in line. 
Except she watches them with detached amusement and apathy. 
Skip is a horrible babysitter, I’d never let her near my own kids, should they ever be born. 
But damn, she is good company. 
She buys a sack from me at least once a week. 
She knows her weed, too. 
We sit on the couch and smoke bowls, drink beer, watch movies, and stay out of the chaos around us. 
My first day in this neighborhood left me with this impression: 
Skip is standing on the lawn in pajamas, smoking a cigarette, watching a young boy and his older sister chase each other around the yard with butter knives. 
“Bitch! I’m ah kill you!” The little boy shouts. 
He can’t be more than ten years old.
“Shut the fuck up, Stewart!” The older sister taunts him. 
She’s probably twelve or thirteen.
“Eat a dick you dirty whore!” Kids these days. 
They grow up so fast.
Skip is smoking in the background and I’m holding their mail in my hand. 
I walk up to her still holding the mail and pull out a pack of smokes with my other hand. 
I set the mail down and light a cigarette. 
“Are they always like this?” I ask.
“Yeah, pretty much. 
Little monsters.” She says it like she’s been asked to watch her neighbor’s dogs.
The front door slams open and a short woman with a mass of curly, tarnished gold hair, a face full of freckles plows by. 
She shouts,
“Skip sweetie, I’m going to work! There’s something edible in the house somewhere, I’m sure you can manage! Also I left you a pack of smokes and a two more beers! I think Dan left some whiskey in the cabinet! I’ll be home at eleven, make sure they brush their teeth tonight, okay?!”
“No prob, Mrs. 
Abbot!” Skip shouts at her as she drives away.
All I can say is wow.
“Yeah, it’s pretty much always like this.” Skip says taking a drag.
“Wow,” I repeat. 
“I’m Skip,” she says, holding out her hand with the cigarette sill between her lips.
“Hayden, nice to meet you.” 
“Yeah, innit? Wanna come in, burn one?” She asks.
“Alright, cool.” I say.
The inside of the house is a shambles. 
Magazines and newspapers in shreds everywhere. 
Bottles of all shapes and sizes line the counter tops, the stove, the top of the refrigerator, the dining room table. 
There are over flowing ash trays in between some of the bottles, on the floor near the couch, all the chairs. 
All the blinds are down, the TV is on, and the atmosphere is fifty percent smoke, fifty percent dust. 
This is the house that clean forgot. 
There’s a foot tall bong on the coffee table, and I’m pretty sure the water hasn’t been changed, ever. 
I produce a small stash box and tell her to pack the first one with this. 
It’s a Kush, Sour Diesel blend, all organic indoor. 
Some of the finest I’ve grown in months. 
Her eyes light up a watt or two. 
Which is hard to register with her, since her eyes are almost always half closed. 
She packs a bowl and we smoke. 
The first hit tastes like lemon and pine. 
She coughs a white cloud up and continues for a minute.
“Damn, dude.” She says.
We pass the bong back and forth, coughing and blowing out smoke from our nostrils and mouths. 
 Feeling our eyes water and our throats burn. 
We smoke until the ash is sucked down the stem. 
“Damn, dude.” Is about all she can say. 
This is one hit quit shit. 
But for the true believers, there’s no such thing as just one hit. 
We’re both a bit dumbstruck. 
A couple of couch locked stoners, staring at nothing in particular and deep in thoughts. 
The television is playing old cartoons. 
Cats and mice and talking animals. 
Impossible slapstick, and sly subtle sexual suggestions. 
I look at my boots and realize that I’m on the job.
“Oh shit, damn. 
I’ve got to get back to work.” I say.
“Oh damn, yeah, right.” She pauses. 
“Hey, can you get more of that stuff?”
“Um, yeah, pretty easily. 
I did grow it.” 
“No shit! Well, huh, got a number or something? Do you deliver?”
“Yeah, yeah, both and.” I write down my name and number. 
“Alright, I’ll see you later?”
“Yeah, yeah. 
Definitely.” I march back outside and the kids are nowhere to be seen. 
The rest of the block was tame in comparison. 
 A few dogs behind fences. 
A few kids riding bikes. 
Suburbs. 
 I hear a small boys voice yelling,
“Stupid fucking cunt!”
All in a day’s work. 
All in a day I walk from house to house, home to home alone in my Postal pedestrianism blues. 
Hey Mister Postman I hear from half a dozen bored housewives in bath robes. 
Hey buddy watch the lawn I hear from a few haggard home body husbands. 
People on front porches drinking in the afternoon sun. 
Old guys watering their yards and plants. 
Cars bring kids home from school and cars taking people away to the city or the nearest shopping center or work. 
 The ebb and flow of the suburbs. 
The wax and wane of neighborhood populations. 
 
Chapter 3: The Skillets to Pay the Bills.
Skip is sitting on the couch. 
It’s a Wednesday afternoon. 
The sky is over cast, normal for early December. 
 She’s watching the history channel on mute while listening to Pink Floyd’s Echoes. 
 She’s two bong loads and a joint deep. 
Her bloodshot, mint green eyes half peer between strands of tomato saffron hair. 
 Her face is freckled, nose narrow, chin in a smooth angle. 
She has sweat pants and a hooded sweater on. 
And sheep skin slippers on her feet. 
Skip sips a beer and smokes slowly. 
Behind her the children run around.
“Fuck off! You’re a bitch!” Says the boy named Stewart, age nine.
“Nuh-uh! You’re a fag-ass nancy queer homo-gay!” Retorts Julia, age twelve.
“Are not! You dyke-bitch shit fucker!” Stewart is running ahead of Julia. 
She’s chasing him with one of her mother’s used tampons extended in front of her.
“Eat it! Eat the blood of the womb that bore you! Suck the blood from the pussy that pushed you into existence!”
“No! No! No! Not until you eat dad’s dick!” 
“Shhhhh!” Hisses skip from the couch.
The children don’t care. 
They have never listened to anyone. 
Despite pain, despite scars, ambulance rides, yelling, teachers, principals, police, priests, and parents. 
Everyone has tried. 
No one has gotten through to them. 
They can laugh anyone off. 
They can fling words at you carelessly. 
They’ll call your mother a whore, you father a bastard fag. 
The children will do whatever they want whenever they want. 
Nothing holds their attention, there is no fear of consequence. 
 They’ve been arrested for starting fires, selling drugs, stealing cars, breaking and entering, assault and battery of the elderly and identity theft. 
All kinds of terrible things. 
There isn’t a school on the West Coast that will accept them. 
And Skip was the only babysitter that would take the job. 
Skip isn’t afraid to fight back.
The Abbot kids have their moments, but it’s not a constant thing. 
Skip has learned a few tricks to keep them semi-normal. 
 She hides all the sugar and alcohol in the house. 
All firearms, and sharp objects should be in a safe box, somewhere under the parent’s bed, preferably. 
 There’s a spare room for laundry that locks from the outside. 
She’s suspected that was the main form of child care before she arrived. 
The room is small, just the washer, dryer and a bench. 
It’s always cold in the laundry room, no matter the time of year. 
At first she thought there might be a way to train them by slipping books under the door, or leaving them on the bench. 
She’d come back later to find either the book ripped to shreds, or used as a bludgeoning weapon.
The parents redefine dysfunctional. 
Both are alcoholics and chain smokers. 
Mr. 
Abbot manages a call center for voice mail technical support. 
Mrs. 
Abbot is a guidance counselor for the local high school. 
 When they’re not occupied at their jobs, when they are at home, they spend most of the time drinking, fucking, yelling, screaming and fighting. 
The kids carry on as usual. 
Insults fly everywhere. 
 However the most that Skip has to endure is the occasional “Fuck off” or “Shut the fuck up, Skip”. 
In general the parents are sweet and kind to her. 
They let her post up on a couch in the garage when she has nowhere else to sleep. 
They don’t complain when they come home to Skip still in front of the t.v. 
apparently immobile, drunk or stoned or asleep. 
As long as Skip is keeping the kids out of jail, or from killing each other or burning the house down. 
As long as Skip can just keep an eye on things. 
Everything is fine.
“Bitch Bitch Bitch!” Stewart has locked himself in the bathroom again.
“Boy if you don’t open up that goddamned door I’m a break it down!” Julia is screaming at him. 
“Stewart I swear to Jesus Christ and Satan God and Buddha and Krishna and Shiva and Allah and Zoroaster and Mormon and Pope Joan! I will piss all over your bed if you don’t open that door right now!” This is how you know Julia is serious. 
She will string along blasphemies in nonsense amalgamations. 
When Julia is pissed off enough to curse all of the gods that come to mind, she will be mad enough to piss all over Stewart’s bed, and his clothes, and anything else in his room. 
“There is no god Jules! I am god! I am Jesus! Jesus wants you to eat twelve dicks for dinner!”
“Fuck you and your cross! The real Jesus is watching you right now! He knows that you’re beating off to gay porn in there! He knows that you tried to fuck the neighbor’s cat! The real Jesus knows that you get off listening to mom and dad fuck in the shower!”
“Whatever ho! I get off to watching America’s Next Top Model! I get off to Cheez-It commercials! I just got off in your shampoo bottle, you stupid bitch!”
“You fucking nigger!”
“Don’t call me a nigger!”
“Bitch nigger! You ain’t no thug! You ain’t a killer! You ain’t hard!”
“Bitch! Shut yo mouth, ‘fore I come out there and slap you across the face with my dick!”
“Just try it! I dare you just try it! See if I won’t cut off your balls in your sleep!”
“If you cut off my balls I’m going to fuck your ass with a firecracker!”
“You’re such a little bitch! I hate you!” Jules leaves the door after pounding on it one last time. 
She kicks open Stewart’s door, gets up on his mattress and pulls her pants off. 
She squats over his sheets, and his pillow. 
 A stream of piss shoots from her, she bobs her pelvis up and down trying to cover as many surfaces as possible. 
 The door to the bathroom flies open. 
Stewart has been putting on his sister’s make up, which was stolen from her mother. 
He charges into his room and catches his sister mid relief. 
 His mouth is open with anger. 
She takes one look at his makeup job and can’t stop laughing. 
“You look like a whore! Ha Ha!”
“YOU PISSED ON MY BED!”
“I told you I would if you didn’t get out of the fucking bathroom, now look what you made me do!”
“You PISSED on my BED!”
“Maybe now you’ll let me in when I hafta go!” She starts pulling her pants up and he comes after her.
“You stupid fucking cunt! You fucking bitch! Dirty whore! Slutbox fuckstain shitlicking asshole!”
“Stewart looks like a bitch whore! Ha Ha!” Jules is trying to run past him and pull her pants all the way up. 
 She’s hop running toward the door. 
Stewart throws a punch at her face and she ducks, tripping him as he runs at her. 
She hops to the door and down the hall to the living room. 
Stewart screams anger and primal rage bellows from his prepubescent voice box. 
 He pounds on the filth laden carpet with his small boy fists. 
 He gets to his feet and darts into the living room to see Jules still struggling to get her pants up all the way. 
She falls over near the couch and fear coats her eyes. 
She squirms trying to get her pants and feet in order and Stewart descends upon her. 
He kicks her legs and punches at her face and chest. 
Jules is screaming help help and fuck you and get off me and I hate you!
Skip spits beer all over both of them.
“If you little shit suckers don’t shut the fuck up or take it outside or calm down I swear I’m going to fuck you both up so bad your parents won’t recognize you. 
They’ll think I replace you with two somehow uglier children. 
They’ll be relieved for a minute. 
I will have made their day if they think I disposed of you two. 
If you two don’t get your shit in order soon so help me Saint Mark, I’m going to destroy both of you and everything you own.” Skip is the alpha. 
Skip is bigger than both of them. 
Skip knows where the knives are and she’s not afraid to draw blood.
“Go to your rooms and listen to music or something.”
“I hate you!” Yells Stewart and slams the door behind him.
“Can I go to the store?” asks Jules.
“I don’t fucking care as long as you’re not on Cops and you’re home by eight so I can feed you.”
Jules slams the front door open and closed. 
Skip exhales deeply and sinks back into the couch. 
She washes her mouth out with beer. 
Skip relaxes. 
It’s been a long day at the Abbot circus.
Mrs. 
Abbot comes home at midnight, drunk and teetering through the maze of empty bottles in the kitchen. 
“Hi Skip,” she says.
“Hi Mrs. 
Abbot.”
“Where are the kids?” 
“Stewart’s in his room, he’s been quiet for a few hours, might be asleep.”
“Fantastic. 
Where’s Julia?”
“I think she’s in the garage, playing with paints.”
“That’s nice. 
Any beer left?”
“I think there’s a bottle lying around somewhere.”
“Thanks dear, will you be sleeping here tonight?”
“Don’t know, Penny might swing by and pick me up.”
“That’s nice. 
If you need anything I’ll be passed out in my room.”
“Thanks Mrs. 
Abbot.”
Mrs. 
Abbot stumbles into her room, leaving a trail of clothes all the way to the door.
Chapter 4: Chicken Fried Steaks Are High.
Chapter 5: Scrambled.
An off key strain of voice lifts over the fog crusted streets of San Francisco. 
It belongs to a man bumping into the walls of an alley. 
He holds a bottle brazenly in one hand, taking long slugs from it on occasion. 
He stumbles along, drunkenly ambling to and fro between the buildings. 
o/~ Take me home, country roads, to the place I be-loooong! West Virginia! Mountain Mama! Take me hoooooome, country roooooooooads! o/~
He pauses to cough. 
John Denver sings on in his head. 
 His head is a lot of hair. 
His nose peers out from between locks of crusty, clumpy rye bread hair. 
His beard is a scrapbook, reaching toward his chest. 
The man decides to take a rest and sits down on a milk crate near the backdoor of a restaurant. 
Hands pad pockets in search of his lighter, his rolling papers, and sack of tobacco. 
The tobacco sits in his lap, he pinches just enough to fill a three and a quarter inch Zig-Zag. 
The ones in the orange package. 
From his left breast pocket he produces a well worn, stainless steel Zippo. 
On the surface of the lighter, in brutal etching, letters spell out Chance. 
Chance happens to not only be the name of the Zippo, but also of the man holding it. 
He lights his cigarette.
You know something? Do ya? I know a few things-  Just a few- I don’t really keep track of things too much- My mind’s been a mess lately- no idea why- Where do I live?

Chance stumbles along the streets of San Francisco, drinking from his pint of liquor, and shouting at various inanimate objects. 
He wanders around to small eateries asking for fuck ups or spare anything, old anything they want to get rid of. 
He scores two loaves of sourdough bread and a bottle of water. 
Walking along the streets now instead of the alley, he sings the theme from Bonanza complete with guitar noises. 
He sings loudly and unashamed, swinging a free arm while the bread is safe under the other. 
He frees a chunk of bread from the loaf and munch masticates in between sung words. 
The street is a sea of people of all sorts, types and kinds. 
They walk and jostle, hustle and bustle their ways around each other into each other. 
To destinations, accidents, plans, purpose and play. 
They talk on their cell phones weaving an intricate pattern of footwork. 
Chapter 6: The Biscuits and Gravy Train.
Chapter 7: Pigs in a Blanket, Watching Pornography.
Upstairs, inside the projection room at a small theater somewhere off Chinatown, are the figures of two young women. 
They’re exchanging a bottle of wine for a joint. 
 She hands her a bottle, she hands her the joint. 
They continue like this for several minutes until they hot-boxed the room and drained half the bottle of red wine. 
They’re drinking an ’03 Cabernet like water. 
Penny looks at her watch and flicks the projector on to life. 
They sit in two third-hand easy chairs, sinking into the coushins. 
The screen flickers to life and the sound of a bag of chips cracks the silence. 
Penny hands the bag over to Skip. 
Jaws munch crunch potato chips as the static and dust on the film give way to the first showing of the evening. 
Tonight is double feature night. 
On the screen a man is driving a nineteen eighties Mercedes Benz convertible down a road that could be anywhere from the central valley to the Nevada Desert to some kind of European country side. 
He’s wearing a pair of oversized aviator sunglasses, recently popularized at the time of the film’s creation by the release of Top Gun. 
He’s wearing a shit eating grin, shoulder length curly blond hair blows around his tanned faced. 
He’s wearing a blue blazer and a red tie. 
His pants are down around his ankles and another mass of blond hair is bouncing up and down on his crotch. 
He holds her head down with one hand, steers with the other and laughs into the open, blue skies. 
He laughs the title on screen as his car exits to the left. 
The title comes on in white lettering, reading: Service Station Six: Spermicide. 
Skip can guess where this movie is going. 
“Have you seen this one before?” She asks Penny.
“Yeah, last weekend. 
And a few other times.” Is the answer.
“So lemme guess. 
The service station is staffed by more big tittied blonds, maybe a brunette, they’re all wearing cut off shorts and barely buttoned short sleeve shirts. 
Whatever’s wrong with the car is going to take a while so the man,”
“E. 
Norman Johnson.” Penny cuts her off, saying the name of royalty. 
“So E. 
Norman Johnson wanders around this harem slash mechanic shop fucking everything that moves and maybe a few things that don’t.
“Not exactly.” Replies Penny
“Why do you know that guy’s name anyway?” Skip asks looking straight ahead.
“Because E. 
Norman Johnson is a role model and personal hero of mine.”
On screen Mr. 
Johnson is taking a line of cocaine off the dashboard and laughing again, looking up at the sky.
“Also, his dick is fucking huge.”
The mass of blond hair attached to the head that contains the mouth that was until now sucking E. 
Norman Johnson’s magnificent member, comes up for air and giggles a little bit, wiping her mouth on her arm. 
Her faces changes from glee to concern then to panic. 
 She begins vomiting profusely, all over E. 
Norman Johnson, all over the car, into the air, herself, the back seat and the dashboard. 
 Her body deflates like a balloon animal that’s been left in the freezer. 
Now limp and lifeless, her corpse falls back onto the still exposed cock of E. 
Norman Johnson. 
 He laughs again with twice as much vigor as before. 
 The camera pans over and they drive off screen.
“Oh my god, dude.” Says Skip still not really believing what just happened.
“It gets better, trust me.” Penny has the same look a million mothers get around Christmas time while watching It’s a Wonderful Life for the fiftieth time. 
She takes a long, steady double gulp of the cab.
E. 
Norman Johnson has not stopped or slowed down his vehicle. 
He has opened the passenger side door and is working on shoving his dearly departed lover’s body to the side of the road while going eighty on a straight stretch of two way. 
He holds the gas down with his left foot, kicking the blond with his right.
“Dude, this is fucking brutal. 
Seriously.” Skip says it distantly.
“Yeah, I know. 
It’s only acting, don’t worry about it. 
What’s the look for?”
“I thought this place only did regular porn, not sexploitation films.”
“Well, a little of both. 
Attendance is down for the regular ol’ porn crowd so we decided to mix it up a little, throw some plot in there. 
More people would rather watch a sexploitation movie in a theater with a bunch of strangers then porn. 
I think it has something to do with the association between hardcore pornography and shame about masturbation, being, typically, a private thing. 
 I don’t know, I haven’t figured it all out yet. 
Someday I’ll conduct a poll about coming here for plot or pussy.”
E. 
Norman Johnson has successfully kicked the blond out of the car, She was half way for a few frames, dragging along the concrete. 
He laughs his large laugh and drives off camera. 
The screen fades to black and refocuses on a body shop. 
Twin girls wearing oil stained tank tops and Ben Davis blues are waxing a red Porsche. 
Their long, black hair is constantly being flicked out of the way. 
It’s obviously a few degrees cold in the garage, and they’re certainly not wearing anything else. 
A curly red head walks by and makes a mark on a clipboard. 
“You two keep that up, it needs to be spotless before Dr. 
Sherman arrives at noon.” The red head monotones her lines. 
Acting is clearly not her forte.
“Yes Ms. 
Fellini.” They sing song in unison, like all twins on camera.
Ms. 
Fellini walks off screen and the shot changes, suddenly to the front of the shop. 
A large sign reads in Day-Glo bubble lettering Fellini’s Body Shop and Service Station. 
Ms. 
Fellini stands outside in cut off denim shorts and a blue denim button up work shirt. 
She’s smoking a cigarette when E. 
Norman Johnson’s Mercedes pulls up, skidding in the gravel. 
He jumps over the door instead of opening it and takes off his ridiculous sunglasses. 
He grins his post ejaculatory shit eating grin, folds the glasses and slides them into the collar of his shirt. 
He walks over to the smoking girl and starts,
“Hey gorgeous, ‘fraid my ride needs a bit of work.”
“Well man, you’ve come to the right place, we can do anything here, full service. 
Satisfaction guaranteed.” She says in between drags.
“That so? Well, that sounds fantastic.” 
“Any idea what’s wrong with your car?”
“Not a clue, I’m kinda ignorant ‘bout automobiles,” he says grinning a grin.
“Well man, don’tcha worry ‘bout a thing. 
My girls will have her up and running like new in no time at all.”
“No time at all? Well, shucks, I was kinda hoping to have a rest up for a while. 
Been on the road since early, got a piss pot around here?”
Ms. 
Fellini motions to an outhouse off to the side. 
 E. 
Norman Johnson walks over, strutting. 
The shot changes back to the inside of the shop. 
“Vickie! Micki!” The sounds of girls giggling. 
“You girls have work to do! Put that hose down!”
The twins look chided and soaking wet. 
“Yes, Ms Fellini.” They chime together with a tinge of sadness. 
They frolic off screen in a blur of bouncing breasts and water. 
The twins are toweling off in a room with some wrenches on the wall. 
They peel each other’s clothes off. 
They kiss and dry each other, giggling though out. 
“This is fucking ridiculous,” says Skip, taking a mean slug of wine.
“What do you expect? Most of these films were made with budgets in the thousands. 
The actresses were recruited from strip clubs. 
No one is in this movie because they’re skilled professionals. 
They’re middle class people with either big tits or big dicks. 
Sometimes both. 
You need to learn how to appreciate camp.”
“I can appreciate camp, sometimes. 
But this, this is just so bad.”
“Ok, we’re going to have a movie marathon one of these nights. 
I’m going to flood your tiny, weed rotted brain with so many Russ Meyer movies that you’ll be begging me to take you to a strip club before the month is over.”
“I don’t know about that. 
We’re going to need a lot of dollar bills, and more wine. 
And some weed.”
“We should bring Hayden along, that seems like his kind of thing anyway.”
“I dunno, he’s never mentioned porn or strip clubs or anything along these lines to me.”
“That’s because you’re one of the most sexually stunted people I’ve ever met. 
You should fuck him too, it’d be good for you.”
“Fuck Hayden? Are you serious?”
“Totally serious. 
He’s kinda cute, and I think he likes you. 
You two spend enough time together, you might as well be fucking.”
“I think he has a girlfriend.”
“What’s a girlfriend?”
“Well Penny, in typical western cultures, it’s common for a man and a woman to screen each other before marriage. 
This screening period is referred to as dating or courting. 
The persons involved in this ritual call themselves boyfriend and girlfriend. 
It’s a title that generally means they are involved in an exclusive relationship, but not always. 
Such as the case of swingers.”
“What’s marriage?”
“Something like slavery but much better financially.”
“Sounds kinda dumb.”
“I know it’s not your thing, but some people like it.”
“Mmm.”
On the screen Vicki and Micki have dried off and put on coveralls with nothing underneath. 
The scene changes to the inside of an outhouse where a young black woman is shitting and reading a copy of Car and Driver. 
 The door opens and E. 
Norman Johnson’s silhouette stands, arms akimbo, and a mighty laugh rings out. 
He gets in and closes the door behind him. 
“Well hell, what’s your name Honey?”
“Do you mind man? I’m taking a fucking shit here.”
“I don’t really mind,” he says, unzipping his pants.
“Jesus fucking Christ!” she says with exclamation points.
He says, “Take, eat, this is my body.” As he’s talking he begins pissing all over the girl, the outhouse, and the magazine.
“Drink of this! This is my piss which is shed for the remission of sins!” And he laughs again.
The girl begins squirming around frantically, panicked and claustrophobic. 
Her body doesn’t know how to get away. 
 She squirms her ass around at just the right time to expel loud flatulence and excrement all over E. 
Norman Johnson. 
He’s still pissing and tries to pressure wash her ass crack. 
He grabs her and works his cock into her shit lubricated asshole. 
He begins thrusting and bucking and jack-hammering her ass. 
The girl is too terrified to scream, too shocked to do anything but shake violently and bite her lips while tears stream from her face.
“Dude! This is fucked up!” Skip is pretty much mortified. 
“What the fuck is wrong with you? How can you actually enjoy this?”
“I dunno, fucked up sense of humor I guess. 
I just blame it on being raised Catholic like everyone else.” Penny pauses to light a cigarette. 
“I mean, if you can’t appreciate the ridiculousness of a good ol’ fashioned outhouse rape scene with all the scat and water sports you could possibly want, then well, damn. 
You can’t appreciate shit.”
“Is anyone actually turned on by this?”
“People are turned on by worse things all the time. 
The human race is a fucked up collective of all the most terrible things you could possible imagine and a few things you don’t dare to.”
“I just don’t get it. 
That girl is so dumb. 
She turned around. 
She had all the time in the world to punch, kick, or bite his junk, but no. 
She panics and turns around and shits on him.”
“See, now you’re starting to get it. 
This is all scripted. 
The most fucked up character in this movie is the writer. 
Writers are all fucked up in the head. 
They have no other outlet for the neurotic, demented and sick things that go on in their heads, so they write it all down. 
It’s like therapy for free, I guess.”
The inside of the outhouse has been busted up. 
Magazine pieces, wet with urine, cover the walls. 
Toilet paper, shit, piss, cum, blood, hair and clothing are everywhere. 
E. 
Norman Johnson finishes ejaculating. 
The girl’s ass is covered in sperm. 
It hangs in the air like two frosted chocolate cupcakes protruding from the abdomen of a young black woman in shock. 
Her eyes are open, her mouth hangs open. 
Her face is battered and bruised from being slammed into the back wall of the outhouse. 
Splinters in her fingers and hands. 
She starts gagging, dry heaving. 
Out of her mouth pours water and bile. 
Her eyes roll back in her head and she collapses, dead. 
E. 
Norman Johnson says,
“Do this in remembrance of me.” And walks out, strutting back to the garage, giggling to himself.

Olivia Martinez is Spanish for olive martini. 
Three olives in a martini glass, plate glass window, and a three piece jazz band calling themselves, currently, Penny and the Pinchers, formerly Loose Change. 
Dimer L’Saque taps the skins while Nickels Robeson tickles the ivories. 
Penny Augustine throws her voice into air, bouncing it off the bar stools, the liquor bottles and the patron saint of bottoms up. 
Olivia with olive skin, not green like a Spanish olive, more like a kalamata. 
 With black olive eyes and pimento fingernails. 
This establishment has been named The Stool Pigeon. 
The name is written in big block black lacquer lettering above the entrance. 
 Penny sings her own lyrics. 
She approaches the chorus from an angle, sneaking up on the words sideways.
o/~ We throw stones in trinities pretending they are sticks, pretending they are sticks, pretending they are bones, inscribed, inscribed with runes. 
I am, I am the north wind. 
I am I am the oracle. 
o/~
Highly regarded as the heaviest jazz band in small circles of eccentrics. 
Penny’s voice is sweet and hypnotic. 
Nickels’ piano work is dark hums and starlight cascades, low pulsing bass note reverberations. 
Dimer’s drums are the love child of Danny Karrie and Elvin Jones. 
Dimer ends his drum solo with a steady progression of minor bass chord progressions from Nickels
o/~ Angels in the grass. 
Angels made of glass. 
Angels made of gas. 
o/~
Penny ends the song on a low note. 
The audience claps. 
The audience includes Olivia, and a young man with shaggy, dirty blond sandy unkempt hair. 
His face negligent with stubble. 
His right hand is occupied in the holding down of his beer glass while his left bangs on the bar. 
Five stools down a finger nail taps in time with his banging. 
Her fingers are long and slender, just like the rest of her. 
A living hold over from heroin chic. 
A Calvin Klein modeling school dropout. 
She was all Twiggy from the neck up. 
Short brown rooted, blond tipped hair. 
Small piercing green, blue rimmed Scandinavian eyes. 
Like two tropical islands caught in a storm named Mary Kay. 
She’s wearing a pomegranate pinot noir halter top and shiny black leather pants. 
She wears her pants like a second skin. 
She stands on five and two thirds inch heels. 
She leans against the bar, showcasing her ass out of habit.
The shaggy blond still has his working clothes on. 
The blue pants with a dark blue stripe down the legs. 
And a postal workers cap next to his beer glass. 
He wears a heavy black denim jacket and brown leather boots. 
His brown eyes follow the curve from heel to calf to ass to back to chest to chin. 
He’s gullible but doesn’t trust the beer’s advice. 
His vision may be playing tricks on him again. 
Beer can only do so much.
“Like what you see?” She has this matter-of-fact Diane Keaton voice.
“Well, sure. 
What’s not to like?”
“Nothing at all. 
I was made to be liked.”
“Were you now?”
“Yes, oh yes. 
From head to toe I was made to be enjoyable.” She turns facing him. 
“Have you ever been to Brazil?”
“To Brazil? Why I don’t think so, no.”
She walks to the stool next to his, looking straight at him. 
She sits down legs wide.
“It’s very nice there,” She says, crossing her legs.
“I’ll bet. 
Is there fresh coffee there all the time?”
“Nope, but there’s plenty of sugar.”
“I take mine with cream also, thanks.”
“Well, Cream isn’t working tonight, otherwise we might be able to work something out. 
I can still take you to Brazil, on the cheap.”
“I don’t know if I can afford to travel right now.”
“Twenty bucks. 
And I can take you to Brazil. 
Grand Tour.”
“Twenty bucks? Are you serious?”
“Well sure, isn’t Brazil worth twenty bucks? Just think of all those sandy white beaches.”
“No, no. 
Wait. 
No, oh man, no no, I just couldn’t.” 
About five silent minutes later, he asks, “just to be sure, we were talking about your vagina, right?”
She sighs and says, “Yeah. 
We were talking about my vagina. 
And I was trying to sell it to you. 
For twenty bucks.”
“Oh, wow.”
“Yeah, sorry. 
I’m kinda new at this. 
Hey Olivia! Beer me?”
Olivia walks over, polishing a glass.
“Watcha need sweetie?”
“A beer. 
A nice big beer.”
“A nice cold PBR for the lady. 
How ‘bout you man? You need anything?”
It takes a few seconds for Olivia to register in his mind.
“I’ll have another of whatever it was I’ve been drinking.”
“Another pitcher of Hamm’s? You got it, man.”
The lady dressed in fruit and wine lets herself relax a bit. 
She spots his postman’s cap.
“Deliver the mail?” She asks him.
“Most of the time, yes,” he answers. 
 “Most of the other times I drink a lot and engage in criminal activity.”
“Doesn’t sound so bad. 
I do a fair amount of drinking and criminal activity myself.”
“Oh yeah? You got a name?”
“Sugar. 
Sugar J. 
Lollipop.” She looks embarrassed. 
“My friends just call me Jay, tho.”
“Sugar Jay.” He smiles real big. 
“That’s quite a name you got there.”
“What about you? You got a name?”
“Hayden.”
“That’s it? Just Hayden?”
“Just Hayden.”
“You don’t have a first name and a last name?
“Oh no, I don’t think so. 
Just a middle name.”
“You don’t think so? You don’t know?”
“Well, I’m going back and forth on the idea. 
Maybe having a last name will come in handy later on, but for now, just Hayden.”
“Well, just Hayden…”
Olivia arrives with a pitcher and a pint glass, with a photo perfect half inch of head. 
She tosses her obsidian elbow length hair behind her and sets the beer on the bar top. 
The bar top is scarred, dented and burned. 
The subject of much abuse, spilled drinks, misplaced cigarettes, and all manner of broken things. 
There are five taps of cheap beer and a fine selection of whiskeys, tequilas and vodkas, gins, and mixers. 
One of the last bars on the west coast that still sells cigarettes and pickled eggs. 
The jukebox is leftover from the late sixties, most of the lights have burned out and the music selection hasn’t been changed in over twenty years. 
 The musicians seat themselves in a row next to Sugar. 
“Whatcha guys need?” asks Olivia.
“Hamm’s with whiskey backs,” says Dimer.
“Whiskey with whiskey backs!” says Nickels.
“Scotch and water with three ice cubes,” says Penny.
“Alright, alright, I can do that.” And Olivia gets to work. 
Pour, pour Olivia. 
The whole of the bar, shelves, and cabinets are made of wood and glass. 
Everything in the place is antique, solid construction. 
West End Girl Detectives
The Story should follow the adventures of two girl detectives. 
Two girls that are solving crimes in a
greater metropolitan area. 
It should be noir as fuck. 
Like all grey mists and dark alley ways. 
The story
will start with two girls and eventually they will grow to a team of five. 
They will be tracking down a
murderer. 
The murder will target certain people of privilege. 
Let’s start with their office.
The office is one of those low rent spots, a little off downtown. 
It will have a frosted glass window with
heir last names on the door. 
The scene will open with the two of them waiting for a case. 
They will be
sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes while a lazy overhead fan spins in circles. 
A few
lines of dialogue. 
Some witty banter. 
Witty banter is a must with the girl detectives. 
Their office is on
he west end of town. 
Let’s make it the Sunset district of San Francisco. 
We don’t have to call it that
exactly but that’s where it will be. 
The girls need names that are very Maltese Falcon. 
There should
definitely be a murder scene on Sydney Green Street. 
Aka Beach Blanket Babylon Boulevard. 
The
murder will be strangulation. 
The killer will be a composite. 
One of those Kevorkian meets Bundy,
meets Lector types. 
The client will be a rich widow. 
Always suspicious but never at fault. 
She will be
vague and some type of aging beauty. 
She’ll be some kind of flapper girl. 
With a bob haircut and always
wearing an evening gown. 
Despite the time of day. 
She will have a chauffeur that will always be a little
more suspicious. 
But it won’t be him. 
His interests are always in keeping his lady free from harm. 
He
will not trust the girl detectives and they won’t trust him.
Maybe we should open with the murder. 
Like in a classic noir film. 
What’s the one, with Bogart? The
other one besides Falcon. 
Shit, it’ll come to me later. 
But like that one. 
With the gun shot and the body
falling and all you see is the hand of the killer. 
The Big Sleep, that’s the one. 
Except it will be a
strangulation like we said earlier. 
The victim will be the window’s sister. 
A younger woman that lost her
way with drugs and sex and gambling. 
She has been out of touch with her sister for many years, having
abandoned her family for the thrill seeking life of the underworld. 
The Underworld will play heavily into
he story. 
Along with crooked cops, snitches, dealers, hookers, bookies, sleazy newspaper men and club
owners.
Now that I’m a little more comfortable in slippers and a flannel, I should be able to write a little easier.
It’s hard to write with cold feet.
We need names for all these people. 
That will come with time. 
The day to start this project snuck up on
me. 
But deadlines are deadlines and the last thing I need is that fat little editor breathing down my neck
about how close I am to being finished and publishers and whatever he always talks about.
If we do this write we could be looking at syndication. 
Like TV and movie options. 
Let’s aim high. 
As
long as nothing can distract me for the month we should be in the clear. 
How hard could it be to finish a
story in thirty days? Not that hard, you’ve done it before.
Back on track. 
So we need duality in the first two girls. 
One will be the common sense by the book type.
The other will be the loose cannon. 
The wild card. 
Opposites in a sense. 
But they work well together
and have a decent track record. 
Enough that a big time murder case lands in their laps from a dame that
would rather keep things quiet. 
She doesn’t want this kind of attention on her family sort of thing.
Reputation and all that. 
There should be a madam character known as the Razor Clam. 
There will be
many scenes taking place in various bars around San Francisco. 
Most of them dark. 
This might require
some research. 
I’ve heard of a place called the Hide a Way. 
Or the hide out. 
It’s supposed to be the
darkest bar in town. 
I like that. 
I’ll give it a shot. 
Still that opens up the possibility of distraction. 
And
distraction is the last thing we need. 
We need at least one thousand six hundred and sixty six words a
day for 30 days. 
And I know already that I won’t be able to make that on some days. 
Distraction will
come. 
And we have to be ready for it. 
But this time I’m going to make it. 
I’m going to win this one.
So we have our main characters:
Laurel J. 
Piedmont, Girl Detective #1 – Straight Shooter, voice of reason, narrative: Earth – brown
Cha Cha O’Henry, Girl Detective #2 – loose cannon, partner, troublemaker: Fire-red

Malatempora
I was watching the ceiling fan as it spun in a lazy orbit. 
The trails of smoke caught in the slow churning
motion. 
The smoke came from my partner. 
Her name was Cha Cha O’Henry. 
She smoked unfiltered
cigarettes. 
We hadn’t spoken in at least an hour. 
I didn’t know for sure since our clock had run out of
batteries last month. 
No one bothered to replace it. 
It was either night or day. 
Even that rarely
mattered.
Our office was a simple thing. 
We had one desk between the two of us. 
There were only two chairs.
There was a purpose to this. 
We liked to have one of us walk around the room while the client would
alk. 
Two seated, one standing or walking. 
Usually talking about someone that’s on the ground.
Sometimes someone already in the ground. 
That’s what we did. 
We listened. 
Then we tried to figure
out the missing pieces. 
Private Investigators. 
That’s what they called people like O’Henry and me.
On the desk we had a phone. 
One of those old land line things that no one uses any more. 
The phone
was black. 
I wanted a rotary, but O’Henry insisted on getting one with buttons. 
She insists I’m old
fashioned. 
I insist that I have a better sense of aesthetic. 
We also have a lamp and a filing cabinet.
There used to be a plant growing in the corner. 
Turns out plants don’t like watered down liquor as much
as I do in the morning. 
Also, I’ve heard that plants like sunshine and fresh air. 
Those can be in short
supply in the office. 
I suppose the plant is one murder mystery we’ve solved. 
The mysterious case of
he dead ficus.
The blinds covering the one window we had were thick with dust, ash and neglect. 
Keeping a neat and
idy office seemed silly since there were no clients to speak of. 
Cleaning wasn’t exactly one of O’Henry’s
strong points. 
She was much better and getting to the point. 
She was better at throwing plants out of
windows then watering them. 
She would rather throw the old blinds out too if she wasn’t hungover and
opposed to sunlight right now. 
Even in the dim light of the office she wore her sunglasses. 
She wore
her sunglasses and smoked her unfiltered cigarettes.
Me? I drank. 
I looked at the fan and drank the two fingers of bourbon we had left after last night. 
I was
aking it slow. 
The chances of getting another bottle on credit from the corner store were getting
slimmer by the hour. 
I had to make this count. 
I needed a little more of last night to make it through
his one. 
If it was night. 
If it wasn’t now, it would be soon enough. 
I didn’t take my eyes off the fan. 
The
fan and my head had at least one thing in common. 
The slow spinning. 
If the spinning ever stopped, I
might lose my momentum. 
And that would be it.
The day of the week was like the time. 
Neither one of us cared. 
It wasn’t important. 
Waiting for a case
is always draining. 
You can’t exactly go door to door. 
Anyone commit any good crimes lately? You need
something investigated? Hell, at this point we’d take a divorce case. 
Like, oh hey, let’s follow your
future ex-husband/wife around and see what they get up to. 
The short answer is always: No Good. 
You
follow anyone around for a while and you realize they’re all no good. 
I guess some people call those no
good things vices. 
I guess that’s why the police force has a vice squad.
The scene is a little place off the main drag. 
It’s a theme joint. 
One of those golden age of the west type
places. 
There’s a player piano. 
On occasion there’s actually someone playing the piano. 
On good nights
here’s a lady with nice legs singing along. 
There’s a series of ceiling fans, driven by belts that swirl away
above the heads of the barflies. 
Seating is limited. 
And it’s a place you don’t want to take your mother.
Or your father should you be one of those types.
The boss makes us wear this getup. 
Like black bow ties and black vests with white shirts and our sleeves
rolled up. 
Suspenders optional. 
He says this is a classy place. 
You have to look classy to work behind
his bar. 
I said that’s fine. 
I was done with the dive scene. 
I’d rather be serving top shelf hard A to those
finance types. 
I’d rather be tipped by people with a larger paycheck then mine. 
They were also easy
customers. 
Martinis all day. 
Good whiskey, usually served neat. 
The occasional Negroni. 
Basics. 
None
of that vodka Redbull, Adios Motherfucker, Long Island Ice Tea shit. 
These people were serious about
heir booze. 
I liked that. 
I liked serving them. 
Even if they weren’t easy to like as people.
The girl in question. 
There’s always a girl in question. 
But this one I’d seen on a few occasions. 
She was
all class. 
Not the fake, pretending type of class that comes from hard work and moving up the ranks.
The kind of class you have to be raised with. 
Because your parents are professionals and they really
don’t have time to raise kids. 
The kind that has dinner parties where everyone is dressed to the nines
and shows up on time. 
They kind of family that has a coat check in their foyer. 
She had to be one of
hose types. 
It’s not something you can learn after a certain age. 
You could tell by the way she carried
herself. 
She walked across a room like the Colossus of Rhodes figure skating for a gold medal. 
She was
one of those types.
“Pernod.” She would say.
That was most of our conversations. 
She would say Pernod, and I would pour it. 
She rarely paid for her
drinks. 
There was always a gentleman accompanying her. 
He would always seem gentle enough. 
But I
know these people. 
They can’t even get a hard on unless it hurts. 
There has to be blindfolds and
handcuffs. 
There has to be hot wax and coarse rope. 
She must have been special. 
One of those girls
hat has a copy of the ‘Thirty under Thirty’ on her nightstand. 
With check marks next to several of the
faces.
I found out through a friend of a friend that her name was Mindy. 
And Mindy makes me think of windy.
And long winded she was not. 
Breezy, maybe. 
She came, she went. 
She was never around for a long
ime. 
She was a two drinks and go kind of person. 
She was around a few times with one guy and gone
for a while then back again with another. 
At least she seemed to like the place. 
If you can show up with
a parade, it can’t be far from home. 
Not so much in a geographical sense. 
More so the conceptual
form.
I may be digressing from my original intent here. 
But bear with me, it’s all relevant.
Last week she shows up with this guy. 
And I’m not one to judge, especially based on looks. 
But we’re
alking not in the same league. 
Ballpark was out of the question. 
I’m fairly certain as to say that they
couldn’t have even been anywhere near the same circles. 
If these two were a Venn diagram, it would be
wo circles on opposite sides of a sphere. 
Anyways, so this couple walks into the bar. 
And I’m back
here, behind it shaking something and pouring it into a martini glass. 
I may have been a Manhattan.
I’m not sure. 
They don’t sit down, not that there’s a seat empty at the bar, but they stand and wait until
I have a minute to inquire about their choice of libation.
“Pernod,” She says.
“I’ll have a gin and tonic,” He says.
There goes two minutes of my life and they tip six on fourteen. 
I’m ok with that. 
Then I never see either
of them again. 
This is strange since she’s always in here at least once a week.
You can tell a lot about a person by the way they knock on a door. 
Like there’s what the kids these days
call a “cop knock.” Three times, really hard, short bursts of fist on door action. 
There’s the solicitor
knock. 
Something like a friendly neighbor, but one that wants something. 
Like a charitable donation.
Or a moment of your time. 
There’s the concerned neighbor. 
The Angry Neighbor, usually because they
are trying to sleep and you can’t and for some reason it’s not as loud to you in your apartment as it is to
hem in their&#39;s despite all the walls between you. 
Somewhere in between all of those is the damsel in
distress knock. 
It is all at once: demanding, desperate, diminutive, docile, and devoid of hope. 
It’s hard
o recognize. 
But in this business, recognition is more of a reflex.
O’Henry and I exchange glances like handing off a bag of blow in a subway station. 
We both turn to the
door and wait to make sure it wasn’t some trick of the brain brought on by bourbon and boredom.
We see a silhouette behind the frosted glass window in the door. 
The one that has our names written
backwards from our perspective. 
We wait.
The knock comes again and O’Henry immediately chimes in, “It’s open!”
Through the door enters a woman. 
She was stately. 
Like she was late to a funeral. 
She was wearing
black. 
That helped with the funeral assumptions. 
She also had a veil. 
That further contributed to the
funeral and added an interesting note of mysteriousness to the equation. 
I like that. 
I like mysteries.
“I need your help.” She said.
Her tone had that tinny quality. 
Like she had considered a few other avenues before settling on our
meager office. 
Like she didn’t want to go to the police. 
Or much of anyone for that matter. 
That was
good for both parties. 
We weren’t much of anyone. 
And we certainly weren’t the police. 
We both
nodded for her to continue.
“There’s been a… problem. 
It’s come up recently.” She trailed off just slightly. 
Like she knew there was
more to the story. 
There were details she wasn’t going to let on about. 
That was ok. 
We were
detectives. 
We could figure it out.
“Look lady. 
We’re going to need more detail if you want us on board. 
In fact we’re going to need all the
details. 
We’re going to need all the facts.” O’Henry said.
She was good at blunt. 
That was one of the reasons I kept her around. 
Sometimes I thought about
hings too much. 
She didn’t think. 
She was a doer. 
She did.
“Oh god it’s just very hard right now.” The lady said. 
She was sitting now in the other chair. 
I was the
sitting one behind the desk. 
O’Henry was the stander. 
She liked to pace around. 
She was fidgety and
mobile. 
I was saving my energy for times of necessity. 
And I had a drink.
“Cut to the chase lady, we don’t have all day,” said O’Henry.
The key to being a good detective is making people believe that you’re very busy. 
In our case, we were.
We were very busy being hungover. 
Hungover from a long few weeks of waiting for a case to fall in our
laps. 
You can’t be eager. 
You have to let the client do that. 
Make them want you. 
That was important.
“It’s my sister. 
She’s been missing.” She pulled a rag from her purse. 
A nice rag. 
The kind of thing you
wouldn’t normally call a rag, more like a handkerchief. 
She blew her nose. 
It seemed unnecessary. 
We
ignored this and waited for her to continue.
“I haven’t seen Mindy in years but I have the feeling that something dreadful has happened to her.
Something I can’t quite fix. 
She’s been gone from the family for a while, but her and me. 
We still kept in
ouch in a way. 
We would leave post cards. 
The occasional phone call from the booth. 
That sort of
hing. 
I know she didn’t want to be found and I was ok with that. 
I respected her privacy. 
In a way I
might have envied her life. 
The freedom she took for herself…” she trailed off again. 
Doing that staring
off into space thing that high school students do when they’re forced to do Shakespeare.
“As I said lady, cut to the chase, we don’t have all day.” O’Henry said. 
She was good for lines like that.
“I need you to find my sister. 
I’m afraid there’s some family business that is between the two of us, but I
need to see her in person. 
It’s the only way we can resolve this matter. 
Please,” She said, “I beg of
you.”
We exchanged glances. 
It was a well rehearsed gesture. 
It was a way of saying, well, what do you think?
Should we take the case or not? It was a way of tricking the client into believing we weren’t just drunk
jerks with nothing to do. 
It made us feel important. 
It gave the air of professionalism.
“Alright,” I said. 
“We’ll take the case. 
We need to know everything you know. 
Last known address.
Phone number, friends. 
Anything we can to help us. 
You can’t just give us a name and expect us to find
her at some restaurant.”
“Her name is Melinda Mary Malatempora. 
She’s my sister. 
If you can find her, there’s a check with five
figures with your names on it. 
I’m counting on you.”
“When you knock on the door of O’Henry and Piedmont, lady. 
You get results.” O’Henry did her best
leaning on something and looking confident. 
It worked for me. 
I believed her. 
I may have been high on
a hire and higher on that bourbon. 
It worked for me.
The rich broad left a picture of her sister and a check to get us started. 
That was the usual way. 
We had
a name and a face and a little money to grease the wheels. 
The first wheel we greased was the one on
he corner store. 
The wheel that spun our little rag doll minds on bottles of rye. 
Our little tab was
cleared and a new bottle to celebrate the case. 
In this office we celebrate the opening of a case. 
Or at
least we celebrate getting a check. 
We celebrate traditionally. 
That is to say we celebrate everything
he exact same way. 
We kill a bottle of rye or bourbon at the office and then get investigating.
The little trip outside let us know that the time of day was around three in the afternoon. 
Early. 
Not the
ime I thought it was. 
I suppose I should get out more. 
But that might just be my mother talking in my
head. 
She’s saying, “Laurel, you’re a young lady. 
You should get out more. 
Meet a nice man. 
Settle
down.” Mom, you should get off my back. 
I got work to do. 
Men come and go. 
But work lasts a life
ime. 
Some people work so they can live. 
Me? I work so I can die. 
I mean, so I can die after I’ve done
something. 
Not like I live to work or anything. 
I live to work on finding out about why people die. 
Aside
from medical things. 
That’s really not my thing. 
I prefer to figure out about when people die because of
other people making them. 
They call that murder in my business. 
They call that murder in most places.
I didn’t want to jump the murder gun just yet. 
Let’s start with where the girl could have ended up. 
We
have two contacts in the police department that take us seriously. 
At least, we like to think so. 
I’m
pretty sure they do. 
We haven’t given them all the reasons necessary to not. 
His name was Lieutenant
Sinclair. 
He worked in vice squad. 
If this girl was hooking, he might know her. 
If she was mixed up in
hat racket, she might have turned up. 
He was a good starting point.
We did the good detective thing and finished the bottle as quickly as we good in order to get right down
o work. 
It was around ten in the evening. 
A good start for us. 
We were hot on the trail. 
We had a
starting point. 
That much we knew. 
You could say we were giddy. 
A little excitement. 
A new case. 
You
could also say we were drunk. 
Because that was a certainty.
WE caught a bus to the police station where Sinclair usually worked. 
The bus wasn’t exactly crowded.
Especially around ten o’clock on whatever day this was. 
It was today. 
It’s always today. 
The bus isn’t
oo good a place to do any kind of detecting. 
We tended to keep to ourselves. 
Mostly we tried to
balance while the bus went up hill and downhill around corners and around and around and O’Henry
was holding onto those very uncomfortable hand hold things they have on busses to keep you from
falling over. 
Falling over was one of those things we were being very cautious about. 
I’m not psychic or
anything but in this current state of being it seemed a very real possibility.
After a few minutes that might have been a lot longer we got off the bus. 
The stop wasn’t the one we
wanted but it was going to have to do. 
We were closer but not quite there yet.
“That wasn’t our stop,” O’Henry said.
“You never know when to stop,” I said in reply.
O’Henry started out the window. 
She did that when I was drunk and said things that might have a little
more weight then I intended.
“These bus routes change all the time anyway.” I said, trying to smooth things over again. 
Or at least
blame something else. 
I didn’t want that cloud hanging over our detective work.
“The city is run by weasels and pranksters. 
Either that or very malicious types that would be better
suited to a life behind bars.”
“Speaking of bars, look what I found.” That’s when I walked into one.
Two girl detectives walk into a bar.
The first one says, “I’ll have a rye and soda.”
The second one says, “I’ll have a rye, neat.”
The bartender says, “That’ll be fourteen dollars.”
The first one takes out a wallet and empties a pile of receipts and old bar tabs and gum and stamps and
notes written on napkins and weird mementos that fit into wallets and finds a few dollar bills folded in
he recesses.
The second one pulls out a twenty from the recently cashed check and hands it over instead. 
She says,
“When we get to the station, let me do the talking.” She sips on her neat rye.
The first one looks at her pile of scrapes on the bar and wonders how she fit all that into her wallet in
he first place. 
She begins putting it all back into place. 
At least she puts it somewhere.
The police station is exactly as I remembered it. 
Very much flourecent lights. 
It’s not that different from
he DMV. 
A lot of beige, a lot of hard plastic like grade school. 
The overwhelming fluorescent
overheads. 
No one smiles in a police station. 
Just like the DMV. 
And the lines. 
The lines are just about
he same. 
Except here there are a few more drunks. 
A few more hookers. 
A few more people that are
obviously strung out on dope. 
Lt. 
Sinclair wasn’t anywhere in sight. 
This was hard to piece together
since most of the people in the room seemed to have a twin along for the ride. 
As far as I could tell, he
wasn’t around.
“Leeggo a’ me! I ain’t done nothin’!” Some dame with fishnets on her gams and a two bit halter is
squirming in the arms of some beat cop.
Vice squad and narcotics have excellent job security in this city. 
There’s never a dull moment. 
O’Henry
and I are slumped against a wall looking around in a haze. 
Like maybe mister lieutenant man will just
come find us. 
Because oh my god is it a mess in here. 
And who in their right minds wanders into a
police station drunk? We must be onto something. 
Only some plan as crazy as this was bound to work
out.
A tall broad in a long coat breezes past us.
“Watch where ya standin’ this ain’t a goddamn flower shop.” I don’t catch her face too well. 
I hear
O’Henry say, “Jeez, what a bitch.”
__\
Aight. 
So this story is getting into dangerous territory with this scene. 
Like we’re dragging. 
We need a
good taxi cab chase soon or some kind of action. 
Maybe we should just jump to the murder scene and
come back to the girls when the Lt. 
has found them or something. 
Maybe a steamy sex scene.
__-
“My, this is a lovely place you have here Mr… what was it again?” A tall leggy broad in a black evening
dress is looking out the window at the lights coming from the city like a thousand little bright dots that
really aren’t that far away at all.
“Dwayne. 
You can call me Dwayne.” A large man with a ruggedly handsome face and the build of a
pitbull answers her.
“Thanks for such a lovely evening, I haven’t been out of the house in what seems like, forever.” She
spins a twirl in her evening dress that shows off her legs and finishes with a smile that made her
homecoming queen what seemed like a very long time ago.
“I know what you mean. 
More wine Mindy?” Dwayne has already opened another bottle. 
The cork
exiting the glass makes a pop that only a bottle of booze with a neat little cork can make.
“Oh yes, thank you.” Mindy sets her glass on the bar and flutters her eye lashes at her pitbull
companion. 
She lets one of the straps on her dress fall off her shoulder.
Dwayne fills her glass a good six ounces. 
She greedily takes a long swig. 
Her teeth gradually becoming
purple with each quaff.
Dwayne loosens his tie. 
He starts to undo the buttons on his jacket, on his vest. 
He turns around and
Mindy is there, closing in. 
She puts a hand on his face and pulls it into hers. 
Their lips lock while her
ongue flicks against his. 
Her hands move around his head and down to his shoulders, pulling his shirt
off. 
She guides his hands to her back and lets him find the zipper. 
He pulls down in a slow, gentle
manner, listening to the teeth of the zipper pull away from each other.
She pushes him against a wall. 
She has him by the throat and smiles in a way that might suggest that
she’s very much in control of the situation. 
She lets her dress fall to the ground, revealing her fully
pushed up breasts, her tight stomach, and her smooth, tan legs. 
She pulls the tie from her hair, letting
he long black length fall over her shoulders. 
She holds him in eye contact, pinning him to the wall with
her gaze. 
She pushes him onto a couch. 
She was a very pushy girl.
She starts at his lips. 
Her lips move to his ear, down to his neck. 
Her hands move across his chest, down
o the hem of his pants. 
She feels his legs and moves to the growing bulge in his pants. 
She strokes him
with her fingertips , kissing his neck, his chest. 
She unfastens his belt and prepares him for takeoff. 
She
slides his pants off from under him and kneels on the ground. 
His hands move from her long, black hair
o her full, perky tits. 
She had a body that made you hungrier with each touch. 
She had a touch that
was like dumping a gallon of heroin right into your brain.
She took his cock in her mouth, just the tip at first. 
Playing circles around it with her tongue. 
She held
his shaft firmly in her hand, guiding it into her mouth, pulling gently at his balls, giving them a little
massage. 
He let out a little gasp. 
A little groan. 
He pulled her head into his dick and felt the back of her
hroat against the tip of his cock.
“Oh god…” he said.
“Mhmmmm.” She said.
She teased and tongued and fondled him for a good five minutes and stood up. 
She dropped her
panties to the ground and felt herself. 
She was wet. 
She was ready. 
She straddled him, holding his cock
against the lips of her pussy until it was guided safely in. 
The plane finally coming into for a landing after
circling the runway.
Her hands where on his shoulders and her breasts were in his face and his penis was in her vagina. 
It
was a very sexy thing. 
You should have been there. 
She rode his cock for a about three minutes when
he grabbed her ass pulled her in close and came. 
All the while saying, “oh god, oh my god I’m coming.”
And Mindy looked down on him and went around the room gathering her clothing from various places
around the apartment. 
She found her wine and swished it around in her mouth, washing all the tastes
out.
She was dressed and standing in front of a mirror, fixing her hair. 
Dwayne was still on the couch, half
slumped over. 
Almost asleep.
“Hey Dwayne. 
Hey buddy. 
Wake up.” Mindy nudged him until he came back around. 
“Gotta run
buddy. 
That’ll be two hundred.”
Dwayne finds his pants and his wallet and extract two hundred dollars and hands it to her.
“Thanks again for the lovely evening,” She kisses him on the forehead and leaves him to sleep.
We finally found Sinclair. 
That is to say, he found us. 
We were still in waiting room, clinging desparatly
o the edges of sobriety when he walked in.
“I had a bad feeling about today. 
Started as soon as I woke up. 
That was my first mistake.”
“You gotta funny way of saying hello, Lieutennet.” O’Henry said, nudging me into consciousness.
“you got some nerve stumbling into headquarters half sauced.” He replied.
“we’re here on official business so lets’ cut to the chase.” I came to in time to find us back in Sinclair’s
office. 
Just as O’Henry slip the picture across the desk. 
“Her name is Mindy Malatempora, you seen
her?” She said.
“I recognize the face. 
She’s been around. 
Usually in for a couple of misdemeanors. 
Who’s got you up
o this?” He said.
“the sister. 
She very concerned about her well being.”
“that so.” Sinclair looked over the photograph.
“Said she needs to see her sister as soon as possible. 
Family business.”
“well the family sure knows a few things about trouble, I can tell you that. 
This one tends to hang
around the north side. 
Usually around Chinatown. 
I’ve picked her up a few times. 
Always seems to get
out quick. 
She’s got some powerful friends.”
“Powerful friends usually have their fingers in some dirty pies.” O’Henry said.
“Usually.” Said Sinclair.
“let us know if she turns up.” I said. 
It came out of my face a bit quickly. 
Like I had to say something
instead of just wobbling there. 
It probably sounded more like, “Lessus know if she churns up.” But I
wasn’t going to sweat it. 
When you’re a detective you learn not to sweat the small stuff.
I was cautious from the start about distractions but it’s been at least two days since I’ve written and now
I’m drastically behind. 
This is a dire situation. 
Some of the problem was sleep patterns and television.
The other problem was women. 
Women are always a problem. 
Problems are usually women and time
management. 
But that’s a topic of discussion for another time. 
We really need to move this story along.
We caught a cab from the cop station and made headway to the north side of town. 
This was
borderlands where the Italians and Chinese liked to party. 
There was some grit, there was grime. 
There
was porridge and there was crime. 
There was polenta, which is wop grits. 
And there was congee which
is rice porridge. 
Rice and corn also make fantastic booze if you let them.
O’Henry was looking straight ahead and smoking a cigarette. 
She had a kind of cool that you couldn’t
buy. 
She had an overwhelming nonchalance that permeated the air around her with an impervious
shield. 
There was only one liquid that could get through to her. 
And that was rye. 
Or occasionally gin.
Sometimes sweet vermouth if she was feeling sentimental. 
Or vodka when she was having one of those
nights when she felt old and settled down. 
That didn’t happen often, but those nights seemed longer
han others. 
She wasn’t much for straight wine. 
Said it was too rich for her blood. 
Even cheap wine. 
I
didn’t get it. 
But then again, I’ll drink anything that comes out of a bottle. 
Or a can. 
Or a jug, or a
leather pouch of some kind, or a mason jar, maybe a beaker when the mood is right. 
I’ve been known
o knock down a couple of vases when the party is getting good. 
Even sometimes I’ll drink out of a mug.
Sometimes I might even take a shot from a mug. 
A mug shot. 
I started giggling in the back seat of the
cab during my monologue. 
It was a very unprofessional thing to do.
The cabbie wasn’t the best of drivers. 
He kept veering and pulling the cab from one side to the other.
This way and that. 
I felt like I was on a rollercoaster. 
O’Henry just kept looking straight ahead. 
At
nothing. 
At everything. 
I was feeling left out. 
I kept thinking about drinking again. 
I wasn’t all that
focused. 
And I was the level headed one.
“Whatcha make of it Chach?” I liked to drop the last ‘a’ in O’Henry’s first name when I was drunk.
Chach has a nice ring to it. 
Sometimes I refer to my vagina as a chach. 
I’ll say things to O’Henry like,
“Jesus, my chach is all in bunches today.” Or “my chach could use some fucking attention, I’m all piss
and vinegar.” O’Henry is used to it. 
She just sits there and gives me the sideways eyes. 
That how I
know she likes me. 
When she tolerates my presence.
“Smells like trouble,” O’Henry replied. 
“I don’t like the older sister much and the younger one seems
even worse.” She was the best judge of character I ever met. 
And she hated almost everyone.
“And what does trouble smell like?” I asked, trying to make conversation in order to stay out of my
head.
“You remember that one time you camped the office for three months. 
You had like, maybe another
pair of clothes. 
You tried to tell me the sink in the hall was good enough. 
You tried to tell me that this
was only temporary. 
You told me everything was temporary and this was another thing so it was going
o be alright. 
Everything ends, you said. 
Soon this will just be a memory. 
Like everything else that ever
happened ever, you said. 
And I sat there with you in the office for three months while you worked out
your shit, smelling like all hell had broken loose within the confines of your oh so personal space. 
That’s
what trouble smells like. 
But you wouldn’t know. 
You acclimated.” She flicked her cigarette butt out
he window. 
It was my turn to stare straight ahead.
“Damn Chach.” That was my clever retort. 
Did you see how fucking clever I was? I’m goddamn amazing
like that. 
Just wait until this story starts getting good
The cab pulled up to the corner of Broadway and Vespucci. 
Where all the strip clubs and whore houses
and great on a budget restaurants and tourist shit holes were at. 
It was all the things you’d think of
when you made it to a place that was a tourist attraction, destination spot and residential area but still
in a city at the same time. 
I love this corner. 
If you could marry a street corner, knowing full well that
he divorce papers were already signed and at a moment’s notice you could drop that shit and walk
away. 
This would be the corner I would marry. 
O’Henry paid the tab and I asked the cabbie something.
I said, “Where can a classy broad like me get a classier broad at this time of day?” He just looked at me
funny, but not like he was about to tell a joke, more like he was looking at me like he was pretty sure
hat he wanted me out of his cab and he had work to do. 
So he just motioned with his head up the
street in the vague direction. 
I was expecting more. 
Maybe life didn’t deliver more because I didn’t
demand it. 
That seemed the way of the world. 
The loudest asshole always gets the most shit.
I got out of the cab and O’Henry was already smoking again. 
She was looking up and down the street
wondering where to start. 
Strip club? Dive bar? Classy bar? Our girl came from a classy family, but that
didn’t mean much. 
Especially after that rap the sister laid on us about how she was all rebellious and
what not. 
I wasn’t expecting her at a classy place. 
Unless her rebellion ran deep in a sense that she was
out to fuck everything of class in some kind of revenge act. 
Like fucking classy people would be like
fucking her past. 
Displaying dominance. 
A strange place that fucking and sex have become. 
Just
another pissing contest. 
Another territorial show, another conquest. 
Not just a party game anymore.
Not just a way to pass the time. 
Not just affection taken as far as possible physically. 
Not just love,
knowing, intimacy, feeling, creation, destruction, climax, contortion, vibration, melting, melding,
moving. 
Just quite simply divide the legs and conquer. 
Beat your chest afterward. 
Plant your flag on the
moon. 
Armstrong. 
Because that’s how you feel. 
You sexy beast, you.
____
I remember back when I believed I was a writer. 
Days and nights spent up late writing and writing. 
Long
afternoons at coffee houses reading and talking with other people that thought themselves writers. 
The
false sense of importance we had. 
The feeling that what we were doing actually mattered to anyone
except us. 
Later in life the wisdom would come that was knowing it doesn’t matter as long as it matters
o you. 
You being I. 
I being the first person singular. 
The only perspective anyone ever really knows. 
All
other perspectives are lies. 
And any writing in them is all lies. 
There’s no possible way to actually write
it. 
You can’t. 
You can’t be honest with yourself thinking you can write that way. 
That’s why I can only
write comedy when I write a female lead. 
I don’t know what that’s like. 
I haven’t the faintest idea what
it’s like to be a girl. 
But most of my stories are like that. 
Girl stories. 
I don’t know why that is. 
I don’t
have a therapist and haven’t been to confession in over a decade. 
I doubt a priest could really help me
with this one either. 
I doubt many people could. 
It’s not like a dilemma or anything, just a pattern I’ve
noticed. 
I like writing stories from either my perspective, as an idiot stuck in a stupid world, or a girl
stuck in a world of absurdity. 
Maybe it doesn’t mean anything. 
More than likely it doesn’t. 
I think it
comes from a desire to try and understand things that aren’t me because all the things that are me I
know and I don’t really find them all that interesting, in fact I think I’m pretty damn boring as a person.
I’m mostly useless. 
My emotional capacity is fleeting if anything. 
I’m a repressed (first due to social
stigma/parental influence. 
Then after a period of ‘self improvement’ and ‘personal realization’ I decided
it was best to bury everything as deep as possible. 
) Self repression. 
We’re all bastards at heart. 
Selfish
bastards with cold black hearts and nothing but personal survival at mind. 
And there’s absolutely
nothing wrong with that. 
But everything and everyone is going to try and make you think that’s a
errible way to look at life. 
It’s only realistic. 
It doesn’t rely on a fantasy world in which people actually
care about each other outside of a situation that involves the subtext of “what can you do for me?”
Which is the only question anyone has ever asked ever. 
The words might be different. 
But it all means
he same thing. 
I’m ok with that. 
Even asking something like, “Are you OK?” that’s just another way of
making sure that that person can do something for you when you need it. 
We are all bastards. 
Each
and every one of us. 
My lease says I’m not allowed to smoke on premises. 
That means my apartment.
But I don’t care right now. 
I have one more and tomorrow is payday. 
Fuck the police. 
I’ve finally drank
enough to make the feelings go away. 
That’s all that matters. 
Today was a downer. 
Today I felt low. 
I
don’t like showing it but the pressures and the bullshit have a way of weighing down on you. 
I thought
maybe I didn’t have to be so alone for a minute. 
I know that’s not the case. 
Deep in my heart I know
hat’s what will always be. 
I’ll always be alone. 
At a party, in a crowd. 
With someone that spends the
night. 
I’ll still wake up alone. 
In body and soul. 
Because ain’t no one getting in there. 
Because I can’t
afford it any more. 
Because who would want to. 
I’m nothing much to want to be with. 
I’m not worth a
damn. 
A second glance, another thought. 
It doesn’t matter. 
I don’t really matter. 
Fertilizer waiting for
my destiny. 
Becoming one with the ground once again. 
But not just the cheap carpet in my apartment.
Becoming worm food. 
Pushing up daises. 
Decomposing. 
Not just composing these stupid symphonies
of silly soliloquies and simple alliteration disguised as brief moments of lucid thoughts woven into words
welcoming wild interpretation. 
I should have been a janitor. 
I should have given up a long time ago. 
I
could have gained more recognition for cleaning bile then writing or cooking or whatever else it is that I
pretend to do. 
Whatever. 
It doesn’t matter really. 
Footnote to future Wikipedia article: he thought
some thoughts that he put on paper. 
After his death no one paid much more attention to his work then
when he was alive. 
The spotlight is immensely uncomfortable anyway. 
It’s my own damn fault for
briefly believing that anyone would or could actually care. 
that was my first mistake.
We’re coming into a scene that happens on Beach Blanket Boulevard. 
The scene is simple. 
A woman in
a short, black evening dress exits a cab. 
She walks into an ally. 
There’s a man there, in the shadows.
But he’s not a surprise. 
They planned on this meeting.
“Hey baby. 
You got the money?” The man says.
“Yeah man, I got it.” The girl says. 
She starts digging around in her purse. 
She starts wondering which
envelope in the envelope in question. 
She finds it. 
Everything is ok. 
She hands it over it him. 
He
counts the money. 
He says,
“Thanks baby.”
“No sweat. 
I’ll see you in a week.”
She breaths a sigh of relief. 
She walks back out of the ally and up the street and back to her apartment.
She swallows a couple of pills to help her sleep and that’s it for the night.
We get out of the cab and up and down the street is so much neon that I have no idea where to go.
O’Henry grabs my arm. 
She says, “this way, I’m sure of it.”
She drags me all swirly eyed into a club that’s much too intense for me right now. 
I sit down in the
corner. 
O’Henry handles business. 
She finds a competent looking human being. 
This takes a while. 
She
shows them the picture. 
She says things like, “Have you seen this girl?” followed by questions like
“When and where?” and “Who was she with?” I sit in the corner like an idiot. 
Tonight, I’m the idiot. 
I
hear O’Henry raise her voice, which is difficult over the boom boom boom of the sound system. 
She’s
yelling, “Don’t fuck with me. 
This is official business.” I look over and see her shaking a waiter by his
shirt. 
He looks very uncomfortable. 
I would be too. 
I’ve been there. 
O’Henry isn’t always nice to me.
Me? I’m laughing. 
Not out loud, really. 
But doing that stifled hand over my mouth laughing. 
Because
I’ve been there too buddy. 
Except this is business. 
And This is Serious. 
O’Henry wrings the guy around
and seems to get a few more details about the girl. 
She walks back to me and grabs my arm.
“We’re leaving.” She says and we leave together. 
I’m still giggling a little bit.
It hits me that I haven’t had a drink in over an hour. 
This confuses and frustrates me. 
But I need to stay
focused. 
“What did you get?” I ask O’Henry.
“Not a lot, but a little more than what we started with. 
Dude I talked to says he saw our girl at a place
called The Motherload rather often. 
Says she liked to take men there on occasion. 
He didn’t remember
much because he has a drinking problem. 
Some good he was. 
Fucking drunk.”
“Pfft, what an asshole. 
So off to the Mother Lode?” I asked.
“The Motherload, and yes. 
That’s our next destination. 
If that was her regular haunt, we might get a
little more out of goons there.” O’Henry lit another cigarette. 
She told me, “tomorrow, I want to go buy
a hat. 
I don’t think I can finish this case without a good hat.”
I look at O’Henry with her hair all slicked back. 
With her eyebrows all neat and tidy. 
With her
maraschino cherry eyes sitting in her martini glass face. 
I tell her, “It’s about damn time you had a good
hat.” She gives me that look. 
The one that lets me know that she likes me.
We get to the Motherload and the damn place is half empty. 
That is to say the bar is empty but the
surrounding area is all full. 
Like tables full of couples all lovey dovey lock face. 
Lips on lips and
whatever. 
I sit at the bar. 
At least I can stare longingly into the face of the one I love. 
The one that says,
‘Rye Whiskey 80 proof.’ Four words that melt my heart every time. 
Always a stand up disposition,
never fails me. 
Never disappoints. 
Always exactly what I was expecting. 
Always just what I wanted.
“You seen this girl?” O’Henry asks the bartender.
“Oh yeah, all the time. 
But not in the last two weeks or so.” He keeps polishing glasses. 
A thing
bartenders do when there’s no drinks to make. 
I’m trying to motion him down to my side. 
Let him pour
me a cocktail. 
A cocktail minus the bitters, the citrus and the mixer. 
A nice clean pour of straight liquor.
Because I fucking deserve it.
“Do you remember who she was with the last time you saw her? Man or woman? How tall? How
short? Distinguishing features? Anything at all.” The Chach was really giving him the run down. 
I held
up my hand in a gesture of two. 
I held two fingers in the air in hopes that he knew what that meant.
You never knew. 
I was just thirsty at this point. 
I would have taken a scotch and soda as long as it was
drinkable. 
As long as it was liquid. 
I’d take it.
“The guy was kinda odd looking. 
Like, I don’t think those two would belong togheter. 
I wouldn’t
imagine it really. 
He looked like a turtle. 
She looked like a fox. 
Not actually like a fox, but like a foxy
lady. 
Like she had that predatory quality. 
If quality was the way you could describe it. 
She seemed
ready to make a kill. 
He seemed ready to be awkward with a girl for the first time in who knows how
long. 
He didn’t strike me as much of anything. 
I think that’s what threw me off.”
“That’s very interesting. 
Anything else you know?” O’Henry asked.
“Nothing at the moment. 
I only know what I saw.” The bartender said.
“Thanks,” I said. 
“you’ve been a great deal of help. 
Also I need a drink.” O’Henry gave me that look
again. 
The one that lets me know that she likes me.
Christ it’s been too long. 
I took something of a break, which is exactly not was I’m supposed to do in this
situation. 
Between two long days off in which I accomplished very little but gained some new cook
books. 
Zero writing tho. 
Blew two whole days. 
And last night I had a house guest. 
An old friend. 
And
not a girl. 
But still. 
No writing. 
Bad distractions. 
I need to get into the habit that I come home, sit down
and write. 
I’m also out of whiskey, that doesn’t help the situation. 
I almost went to the bar tonight.
Katherine was working, which is always tempting. 
If I were given license to start a TV sitcom, I’d do My
Three Katherines. 
It would star Katie Carroll, Kat Su, and Katy Perry. 
A man, a cat, and two women. 
At
least, she purrs like a cat. 
Classic three man team, The Fool, The Leader, and The only Sane Man in the
Room. 
Aka Perry, Su, Carroll. 
Hijinks would include things like Su scheming, Carroll providing reason (to
an extent.), and Perry just screwing up everything like a psychopath. 
I would be entertained. 
I know
hat much. 
In this story it would be like: Laurel, Cha Cha, and Bremmer – who has yet to be introduced.
But soon. 
Time to move the plot lines together. 
Start weaving. 
We don’t have to do it like last time
where we were fifty pages deep and no two plot lines crossed. 
I think I was going for that explosive
collision ending. 
This time lets weave as we go. 
We can end the story with a ball of yarn getting
smacked around by a Cat. 
As it were.
Todd:
Today I made a girl cry. 
That’s all that consumes my thoughts right now. 
That’s all that really matters. 
When you break it down. 
I mean really. 
Like the shit that makes you not fall asleep at night. 
It’s shit like making girls cry that keeps you awake.
The thing was, she is, she was aa pretty girl. 
She is, she was the kind of girl that you’d want to ask out on a date or a night or a something or other. 
And I made her cry. 
Not because I was feeling mean or I wanted her to. 
I just did. 
I said the wrong thing. 
I made a bad joke. 
It wasn’t funny. 
No one laughed. 
I said a thing and then I looked at her and she was crying and I felt like and asshole. 
Neither of us could help those things. 
It already happened. 
I knew there was nothing I could say that would make it better. 
There was no way I could make everything ok. 
Words got me in to this mess. 
Nothing could get me out. 
Truth is, I actually liked this girl. 
I thought she was a gift to my existence. 
I liked It when she was around, and felt like something was missing when she was not around. 
When she was there in all her understated, don’t mind me, I’m just here and have been glory. 
It was a challenge. 
Like, should I take a chance, should I acknowledge her in a way beyond the work environment kind of way. 
I couldn’t right out say that I thought she was pretty. 
I couldn’t straight up tell her that when it came time to get someone a job, when it was up between her and this guy that didn’t cut the mustard and the boss asks me who to hire and I tell him to hire the girl because she’s nice, doesn’t ask anything from anyone, isn’t a needy bitch and tries so hard to just get what needs to be done, done. 
 I can’t tell her that. 
That might make her think that I like her too much. 
Just because she’s pretty. 
And when I say that I mean, she’s like gorgeous. 
Like the first time you see her, you can’t remember what you where, should be or are supposed to be doing gorgeous. 
And she doesn’t act like she knows it, which is the frustrating part. 
 You figure, she has to know. 
She must have some idea. 
She can’t just wake up every day to that face and not know how she looks and what effect that has on everyone she comes into contact with.
But you never believe it. 
You never will and you can’t because she acts like she has no idea. 
You, and you begin to believe that she doesn’t even know even if, even though you see for yourself the effect she has on everyone she comes into contact with. 
And that’s just it. 
There is no solution. 
There’s no way to right a wrong of the tongue when all you did was say a thing that meant nothing, thought it meant nothing and then there’s this girl crying and you’re like goddamn. 
Goddamn I just did something bad. 
Something unforgiveable. 
A thing that made a pretty girl cry because maybe I don’t have feelings anymore and maybe I don’t really have a sense of humor anymore and nothing is really what it seems to be and it was just a thing that came out of my mouth and I didn’t mean any harm but then there you are all tears and trying to work and I have no idea what to do with you at that point so I can’t do anything and just sort of leave you alone. 
That’s how this story begins. 
Because I made a girl cry. 
Because you should know that I’m an asshole. 
We should be straight up about that from the get go. 
I’m an asshole, I make girls cry. 
End of story. 
But let’s get deeper. 
Let’s see what else there is to this story. 
I just want you to know what you’re getting into. 
That today I made a girl cry. 
Maybe tomorrow I’ll make a girl stab me in the heart. 
We’ll see. 
Tomorrow is a few hours away. 
Anything could and will and can happen. 
Short of the long is that I’m a dick and I will be. 
Those who I come into contact will are going to have to deal with that. 
There will be consequences. 
I will deal with those as they come along. 
Either way, I’m just fertilizer waiting to happen. 
I’m just a corpse that hasn’t had it’s day yet. 
I’m just ashes or bones. 
I’m just a shell that hasn’t been decomposed just yet. 
But the time will come. 
And when it does, there won’t be any major changes. 
Just another body under ground or in the wind or with a plaque. 
Who knows, who cares? Just a memory that will fade, just a person that will slash won’t leave some kind of impact on the rest of anything that contact brings within proximity.
Chester:
I can’t find a way to sleep that lets my crotch breath right. 
No matter which way I turn, be it left or right on my side or my back or whatever. 
I start to sweat. 
My bones are aching and my face itches a motherfucker. 
I shift each and every way but none of them make sense. 
It’s night time but from the street light you wouldn’t know it. 
Trucks are passing by. 
Making late night slash early morning deliveries. 
All kinds of shit. 
Furniture and FedEx packages. 
Lamps and desks and letters from home and to home and big envelopes full of promise. 
And I can’t sleep a wink. 
I won’t sleep tonight. 
I’m trying to sleep with no clothes tonight. 
The air is hot inside and too cold outside like if I crack a window open it will be too great a shift. 
Too cold that would cut threw the blankets and the sheets and even the beard on my face couldn’t stop the cold air from hitting right where it hurts.
I toss again and turn around and lay spread eagle with half a blanket on me. 
I suppose it doesn’t matter too much. 
I’m all out of dreams to look forward to when sleep would finally grace me with the sweet relief of rest. 
So I lay out stretched and open and covered in a thin layer of my own sweat. 
Wondering what time it is and wishing it was a time that it couldn’t be. 
I’m not sure if it was the past or the present that I’d rather be in. 
The past was tainted with a veneer of blurred memories where the bad is forgotten and the good is left behind leaving a only a shadow of truth and figure of lies that I found rather soothing.
What I wouldn’t give to just stop thinking. 
If I could only stop thinking for a while and just sleep a dreamless, thoughtless easy sleep. 
The kind that drinkers and junkies sleep. 
I crave peace and rest and anything.
My apartment is a one bedroom thing. 
In a complex with some thirty other units and this fat lady with all the keys. 
The kind of fat lady that always wears dresses because pants would just let everyone know the obviousness of her obesity. 
She had a bitchy face and was always worse when you had to hand over the rent check and she has this pair of glasses, the kind on a chain around her neck that she only put on for reading the rent checks. 
And she looks over the check with the glasses on the edge of her nose. 
And all you can really think about is choking her with those damned glasses of hers. 
The nice thing about the apartment is that there’s a pool. 
I don’t like swimming, but having the pool around is nice. 
It’s no good for me. 
I don’t really hang around it or anything. 
I’m kind of a work from home type. 
One of those envelope stuffers you always hear about. 
 The work is simple and I don’t have to leave the house much. 
It works out. 
Outside my apartment are too many things that I can’t really, don’t want to and probably shouldn’t deal with.
Petra:
My bike has a flat tire. 
Right now, at this moment I’m sitting on a sidewalk with a bike with a flat tire. 
I didn’t ask for this. 
And believe you me I want nothing to do with a flat tire or a bike or the sidewalk. 
I’m fifteen minutes late for a job interview and at this point I might as well phone it in. 
The job is one of those classified ad answering things where I lost one job because they couldn’t pay and stopped paying me and didn’t bother telling me until the pay check was supposed to come and they told me just to wait a few more days. 
The classified ad was looking for someone that could work odd hours and weedends and had no problem with deadlines and stress and cramped work environments. 
I was like sure. 
I can do that. 
I’m all over it. 
I called them up and schedule a time where we could sit down and talk about how awesome I will be at this job. 
I brush the hair off my face and look at my flat tire and kick it. 
I swear at my bike and keep sitting down. 
It’s time to call in. 
to say oh, damn my bike done fucked up my timing. 
I’m sorry about that can we reschedule? I really would like the oppourtunity to work here at this whatever is that you do at this place job. 
But I assure you that I’m the girl for the job and I’m sure that I can do everything you want and more and we’ll both be happy and better off so please give me another chance. 
I pick up the phone and call and wait and the phone rings in some office somewhere or maybe it’s a warehouse. 
I don’t rightly know. 
I don’t really care. 
It’ll be a job, it’ll be new. 
There will be people there I like and people I don’t like and goddamn it please pick up the fucking phone.
Ring ring. 
Nothing. 
Ring ring.
You’ve got to be kidding me. 
No voicemail, no answering machine. 
No nothing. 
I’m twenty minutes late now and I’m like fuck it. 
I’ll show up, knock on the door until I talk to someone and I’ll be so charming that they’ll take me right in. 
I make a logical decision and lock my flat tire bike up next to the bus stop and wait for the next bus downtown. 
Todd:
I went to work today and everything was different. 
The crying girl called in sick. 
She wasn’t around. 
I went through the motions. 
I did my job. 
Everything just sort of happened and I wasn’t really there to do anything about it. 
I let it happen. 
It happened around me. 
It’s like when you come home after a trip on an airplane. 
I was half asleep in a little metal box with wings and then I was somewhere else for a while and then I was back home and it seemed like nothing really changed but time passed by without me. 
At the end of the day the manager called me into his office. 
The manager was a fat man, middle aged, the kind that wears a tie even on his day off. 
His tie was always different. 
He had glasses and a managerial mustache. 
I imagined that he thought himself very much in authority. 
He was sitting at his desk. 
He was always sitting at his desk. 
He says, Todd, have a seat. 
I sit down. 
I’m wearing my work uniform with its polo shirt and nondescript black pants. 
The manager, let’s call him Robert. 
He’s sitting looking at me like I know why he called me in here. 
He’s fidgeting with a pencil. 
I never liked pencils. 
Too easy to erase.
Robert he says, Todd, I think I know why I called you in here. 
I’m like, no sir. 
No idea.
Robert says, Lisa called in sick today. 
Do you know why she called in sick, Todd?
No sir, I do not. 
I have no idea.
Robert says, she said she wasn’t feeling well. 
Any idea why she wasn’t feeling well?
No sir, no idea.
Robert fidgets with his tie, he doesn’t look me in the eye much. 
Like this is just as unpleasant for him. 
Just as uncomfortable. 
 Robert says, I saw you two talking yesterday before closing. 
She looked like she was crying. 
Did you say something that would make her cry Todd?
Sir, she just started crying. 
I don’t know why. 
I say it like crying is just what Lisa does. 
Lisa is a crier. 
Could have been anything. 
Maybe her pet hamster died or something. 
No my fault.
Robert taps his pencil on his tie and says, ok. 
Ok I guess we’re done here. 
Have a nice weekend Todd.
You too sir. 
I get up and leave the office. 
I grab my bag with a book and a sweater in it and go to the train station. 
I want to go home and heat up some food and watch TV and forget about work for two days.
Chester:
There was an ad in the classifieds. 
It says: Trouble Sleeping? Do you have insomnia? Enroll in sleep study, earn up to 100$. 
I’m like sweet. 
That sounds about right. 
The study takes place at this psychology lab up on the hill. 
I make the phone call and they ask me some questions. 
I answer everything like damn, I can’t fucking sleep. 
Please help me. 
And they’re like, we’ll call you back and let you know. 
I tried napping on the couch this afternoon. 
The sun somehow made it past the blinds and into the house and on my face and I was tossing and turning on the couch and had a little white noise and everything and even tried warm milk and was lying on my face for what must have been hours but probably wasn’t when the phone rang. 
I picked up the phone and there’s a woman on the other end of the line and she’s like is this Chester and I’m like yeah. 
She asks if I can stop by the lab for a second interview. 
She wants to meet tomorrow around two in the after noon. 
I can do that. 
I’m all about it. 
I say yes. 
I’ll be there at two. 
She says if I don’t mind, I’ll have to sleep in the lab for a few nights. 
That’s cool. 
I have no other obligations. 
Nothing to explain to no one. 
I sit at the kitchen table. 
One of those folding lawn furniture for playing cards or improtu barbeques kind of deals. 
There’s a stack of empty envelopes on my left and a stack of full envelopes on my right. 
There’s a pile of paper that needs to go into the envelopes in front of me. 
And a pot of coffee that I drink out of. 
I fold in silence. 
Delicately placing each piece of paper in each envelope and sealing it with a piece of moist sponge I keep on hand for just such purposes. 
I’m thinking about tomorrow at two. 
I’m thinking about nothing at all.
Curling and Me.
Something strange happened to me in February from the 16th to the 26th of two thousand and ten. 
It started right when the Olympics did. 
It started, really four years ago when I happened upon the game of curling. 
Specifically, women’s curling. 
Color me captivated. 
Somewhere in between shuffleboard and chess on ice. 
I watched it for hours. 
I’d watch women from around the world throw forty-four pound granite rocks at concentric circles on the other end of a hundred and fifty foot long sheet of ice. 
There was something very zen about the whole thing. 
The click of the rocks, the skip screaming her heart out at the sweepers. 
The roar of the crowd after a good draw, a nice chip and roll. 
When the stone sneaks in the hole, into the house and lands right on the button. 
And the crowd goes crazy. 
For two weeks in February I was obsessed. 
I’d check the scores on every game day. 
I’d watch every chance I could, in bars, at home on the computer. 
Each game came curling into my home in the wee hours of night as I’d lie in bed, my legs sore and immobile from working for twelve hours a day. 
 Curling was rest. 
Curling was meditation. 
Curling was a grand game with a lot of pretty faces.
I was helping a restaurant open at the time. 
About two months into the whole thing. 
I was something like third in command of a kitchen that was as serious as it was ridiculous. 
Absurd as it was beautiful . 
As awkward and quirky and disgusting and elegant as a kitchen can be. 
The whole thing hurt my brain and my spirit. 
It was crippling me quickly and I could feel my soul and body being beaten with celery stalks, pelted with onions, crippled with carrots. 
In short, I was tired. 
I was tired all the time. 
I could think and move only on autopilot. 
I was trying my hardest. 
I was working unpaid four hours a day. 
I gave everything my best and my best never seemed good enough. 
Almost daily the chef would take me outside to talk. 
These were usually two to five minute conversations in which I got in maybe two words edgewise and would have been better off just nodding and agreeing. 
My vocabulary was trimmed down to “yes” and “I understand”.
I got off work that day around twelve thirty in the morning. 
There was about an hour left of good drinking time. 
I went straight to the bar on a Wednesday night and sat alone with three to four stools free on either side of me. 
The bartenders were all girls. 
I liked this bar. 
It was a nice place to drink bourbon on a Wednesday night. 
On the TV in the corner, the curling continued. 
The match was Great Britain versus the United States. 
This was the game that changed me. 
This was the moment where I lost touch with reality, sanity and common sense. 
The skip for Great Britain was nineteen years old. 
Youngest skip ever at the Olympics. 
She was fit. 
She was pretty. 
She had won the juniors for the last three years in a row. 
Her name is Eve Muirhead. 
If anything, she was the final stone in my house. 
The hammer that nailed me. 
She could skip my rocks any day. 
If anything it was her contagious passion for the game that took my about the neck, dragged me over the hog line and swept me off my feet. 
The girl could scream. 
The way she yelled at the stone, at the sweepers. 
Just screaming her heart out. 
Always going, “HARD! REALLY HARD!” It was all a bit overwhelming. 
The whiskey and the bar and the curling and the barmaids that spoke about starting their own little curling team. 
I don’t believe they were serious. 
They said it seemed like a good game to play while drinking.
“If anything comes back off the grill tonight, I’m moving to Vancouver before tomorrow. 
I won’t be coming to work anymore. 
I think I’ll get a job driving the Zamboni around after hours. 
Practice some curling between the hours of two and four in the morning. 
That sounds nice.” I was sweating proufously and grilling a few hamburgers. 
The sous chef was looking at me with a raised eyebrow. 
She stood short with her hair in a tight bun on the back of her head. 
She always looked at me like she wanted me to shut up. 
I always looked at her as if I knew nothing. 
We had a healthy relationship.
The day was February 23rd. 
It was to be a great day for curling. 
It was rather a day of heartbreak. 
A rather good day for a heartbreak. 
I checked my phone every half hour. 
Checking scores. 
Seeing how the girls were doing. 
I was secretly rooting for the UK. 
I know it was treasonous. 
I know it was wrong. 
But I couldn’t help it. 
I have a soft spot for prodigies. 
 For a hard working nineteen year old commanding a team of women twice her age. 
I heard she plays bagpipes too. 
A real up and comer. 
 A kid defending Scotland, the very country and invented the game, going head to head with Canada, the country that took curling very seriously. 
Heartbreak came in the form of Cheryl Bernard, the Canadian skip. 
She had the look of an old school mate’s mom. 
Like when you go over to a friend’s house after class and you meet his or her mother and they just happened to have a plate of still warm cookies. 
Maybe she was the kind of mom that had milk in a pitcher in the fridge. 
Except that she was Canadian, and they keep their milk in bags.
Concurrently, there was a game between the United States and China. 
This was China’s first time curling at the Olympics. 
They had been training on Canadian soil, over in Alberta. 
Their training must have been extensive. 
They attacked with a kind of technical precision that was borderline evil. 
Calculated and calm, cool and collected. 
I checked the scores. 
Both games tied at 5. 
The tension was slow murder. 
Like being crushed by stone after stone, lowered slowly on your chest until the weight made breathing unbearable. 
I should have been there. 
I should have been in Vancouver shouting my support from the stands. 
Both games went an extra end. 
Both games the teams I rooted for took a beating in the last end. 
And like that, they were out of the running.
“I need more out of you,” he said. 
“I know you’re trying fucking hard and you’re doing a good fucking job. 
But I need more. 
You need to step up in a big way. 
Real fucking type A personality. 
Get in people’s faces when you see something wrong. 
You need to be a fucking man. 
No more of this pussy shit.”
“Yes,” I said. 
“I understand.” I said.
The chef was mad at me again. 
I don’t know if it was madness or anger or frustration or what. 
It was like I couldn’t do anything right enough. 
Like there was always something not as good as it could be. 
Like no matter what I did, he didn’t like it. 
He was impossible. 
I was impossible. 
The job was impossible. 
And it had to be done. 
I had to do it. 
All I could do was keep going. 
Forward momentum. 
I needed a sweeper to slick the ice, to keep me going. 
Inch me right into the house. 
I needed to get on the goddamn button. 
But there was always something. 
I took a lot of heat. 
I took a lot of abuse. 
And in my head and my thoughts all I could think about was the semi finals coming up. 
Canada vs. 
Switzerland, China at Sweden. 
Sweden? I hadn’t even noticed Sweden. 
I didn’t know what the world was up against. 
I didn’t count on Anette Norberg. 
I don’t think anyone did. 
Except maybe Cheryl Bernard.
After hearing about Sweden’s victory over China, my mind went for another loop. 
I figured China was going to steal this one for sure. 
It seemed like it was going to be China on Canada for the gold. 
Switzerland played well enough, but not consistently enough to be seriously considered. 
Even so. 
These were going to be nail-biters. 
Just about as brutal as curling can be. 
And there I was, stuck at work. 
Cut off from everything that mattered. 
Everything that mattered happened in the semis. 
 The semi final games showed the world how cold blooded Norberg was. 
How ruthless and relentless. 
All the effort in China couldn’t stop her. 
Bernard walked all over Switzerland in her fancy curling shoes. 
She did a little tap dance at the end. 
A little victory dance. 
 A little premature. 
I was at something stupid like seventy-five hours that week. 
I was looking forward to tomorrow. 
The gold medal game. 
Canada vs. 
Sweden. 
I had the day off. 
I was going to wake up at nine to watch China pummel Switzerland back into neutrality. 
Take a nap and catch the three p.m. 
gold game. 
Then there was a disaster. 
The sous chef called in sick. 
An insult. 
A disappointment. 
You don’t call in sick. 
I don’t call in sick. 
Not on gold medal day. 
There I was, the only one that could fill her spot. 
 I had to take the hit. 
Go an extra end. 
What’s another eight hours, anyway. 
I’m sure I could catch the game later. 
I went to the restroom and checked the scores. 
Canada 2, Sweden 4. 
Canada 6, Sweden 4. 
Sweden 6, Canada 6. 
Extra end. 
Going into the 11th end. 
I was on my god only knows cup of coffee. 
My hands were shaking, my palms were sweating. 
I had a handful of tickets and a table full of plates.
“You! Go to 203 with the chicken and the kale, positions one and two.” I handed off two plates and three more hit the table. 
I was expediting two hundred and thirty people’s worth of food in a five hour stretch. 
My eyes had enough bags under them to pack for two weeks in Vancouver. 
“Runner! I need a runner!” The ticket machine kept printing. 
I looked at it the same way Eve Muirhead looked at Cheryl Bernard in the tenth. 
Like, why are you doing this to me? Like, why now? Why like this? I’m sure there’s a better way. 
I got off work much later. 
Something around midnight. 
Something like too little too late. 
I checked the scores again. 
Swedish victory, 7-6. 
Sure I wished defeat on Canada for crushing the Brits. 
But still I felt nothing but sour about it. 
Curling is a game of defeat. 
The sweet taste of agony. 
The struggle of futility. 
Curling was something like a great metaphor for life in February. 
 For all my efforts in vain, for all the efforts of the curling teams. 
For all the underdogs that took a bullet. 
To them I raised my bourbon glass and saluted the screen. 
I watched the gold medal game over and over. 
The tenth end is like watching a slow motion punch in the face. 
The hammer in the eleventh is the stone that breaks hearts. 
None of it really mattered anymore. 
It had become a necessary part of me. 
A cancerous, out of control mutation in my brain that helped me disregard everything else in life. 
My affection for that game was like that of an ex-lover. 
You think of them sometimes and feel something you’d rather not try to describe. 
I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore. 
I don’t understand what to do with my life. 
The Junior Championships started today. 
The women’s championships starts on the 20th. 
All I know is that it’s just beginning. 
And the worst is far from over. 
 
Part 2: The Chinchilla.
Her name was Nikki. 
We worked together for a good two weeks before she introduced herself. 
She said, “Hi, I’m Nikki.” and I said, “Hi, I’m Nick.” 
“That should be easy to remember,” she said. 
And that’s how we met. 
I remember her blue eyes and her smile. 
The tone and timber of her voice. 
Offensively pleasent. 
That’s what i told her later. 
She had the kind of voice you’d expect on a late night love song radio station. 
She had the kind of voice that could give you the worst news and you’d be ok with it. 
Her voice could sign peace treaties. 
I relized slightly later on that there was something else about her. 
Something that made me believe for a time that she was someone i’d been looking for. 
There’s a line in Hemmingway. 
In The Sun Also Rises. 
When he described Lady Brett for the first time. 
“Her hair was cut short like a boys. 
She started all that. 
And built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht.”  That was Nikki all over. 
And her face was the kind that turned heads and broke them. 
When she didn’t think anyone was looking, her face seemed troubled. 
Things like that. 
little details. 
I’ve always prided myself on my powers of observation. 
And Nikki stole my observations for a good while. 
After our initial meeting not a lot happened for a few days. 
She locked eyes often. 
And little smiles. 
Blushing. 
That kind of thing. 
Then came Murphy’s birthday. 
I don’t usually drink with coworkers unless they find me at the bar or it’s a special occassion. 
Someone’s last day. 
Someone’s birthday. 
For Murphy, I’d go out. 
I felt like drinking anyway. 
People went around after work, rallied the troops. 
Nikki seemed hesitant. 
She asked if i was going. 
I said yes. 
She said she would go too. 
I was last out. 
Got out around one. 
Went to the bar, bought Murphy a drink. 
Bought myself three. 
Talked to all the people, smoked many cigarettes. 
Didn’t talk to Nikki. 
One of the other cooks was. 
Then the bar closed. 
 Kat and Dan were offering their place for the after party. 
I knew that ment coke. 
I wasn’t working the next day so I said sure. 
Let’s do this. 
it had been a while anyway. 
I could use an early morning kinda night. 
Then Nikki came along. 
We each did a bump and sat on the couch, petting the dogs and talking until six. 
I didn’t think too much of it. 
But i did notice that she seemed to talk to me all night like nothing else mattered. 
Then it was six and the sun was coming up. 
So i said it was time for me to leave. 
She got up as well. 
We waited outside for her cab. 
It was cold so i held her close and rubbed her back to keep her warm. 
Then she looked up. 
She looked up into my eyes. 
And we kissed. 
Then her cab came. 
I asked if she wanted to stay the night. 
She said no and jumped in her cab and off to her own bed. 
I bought some orange juice and went home. 
A few days passed. 
I worked in the kitchen and did my job and time flew by. 
Then one night, before she left, Nikki handed me a slip of paper. 
she said, “And this is for you.” and walked away. 
She gave me her number. 
I held that in my pocket for a good hour before i started sending her messeges. 
She texted me back. 
It was that kind of giddy, heart racing sort of thing. 
This went on for several days. 
Then there was a night. 
I was closing the restaurant and Nikki was the closing server. 
She asked if i wanted to get a drink when i got out. 
I said yes of course. 
I got out at one in the morning. 
I had to sous vide a stack of pork bellies. 
it took a while to get everything worked out. 
When i made it to the bar, Nikki was hanging out with Ben, who was very drunk and going through some kind of crisis. 
I joined them and listened to Ben talk about this and that and it was mostly a lot of drunken rambling. 
The Domestication of Shun Feng
I met her in late 2007. 
I remember it being around thanksgiving. 
Certainly before Christmas. 
The exact date and time have long since vanished from memory. 
Almost everything else about her hasn’t. 
She was and is a pastry chef. 
Her given name, the one her family calls her, means ship leaving harbor. 
I should have known then that it would impossible to ever keep her around for long. 
I had just moved to the bay area and was trying out at a new job. 
Working next to her as the pantry cook. 
My world was salads and long wooden platters of sliced meats and cheeses. 
Hers was a world of sugar, confections, cakes and gelato. 
I remember distinctly a kind of nervous energy between us. 
Like when you meet someone and you don’t really make too much eye contact because you might get lost. 
You might forget what you were doing. 
it might unsettle your brain a little. 
I did what i could not to think about it. 
The job i had left in Santa Cruz was my life for two years. 
The chef was a crazy, crack smoking alcoholic. 
His sous chef wasn’t far behind. 
The owner bounced checks and spent all day, everyday drinking his inventory. 
The servers were all girls in their twenties. 
Mostly fresh from college or finishing up their degrees in art history or agriculture. 
They were all very pretty and silly and we all spent a lot of time together in a very small manic restaurant in a back alley behind the movie theater. 
There was one girl in particular, that ruined me for a little while. 
Later on, ruined me much worse. 
But that’s another story for another time. 
I came to the bay area with hopes of a fresh start. 
Away from the drugs and the futility of chasing a skirt that was stuck in an empty relationship. 
I was going to keep my head down, do my job, pay my rent and disregard everything else for a while. 
a kind of autumnal cleansing. 
That didn’t last very long. 
maybe a week.
The first thing i remember about Shun Feng was her cookies. 
The night i was trying out the job, the restaurant was doing a special dinner and she made peanut butter bacon fat cookies shaped like little pigs. 
She came flying back into the kitchen later in the evening to check on her assistant. 
To check her cookies and check her assistant and see just how everything was going for the rest of the kitchen. 
I don’t think she said much to me. 
Or maybe she didn’t say anything that night. 
But there was a moment when our eyes met and a knowing look crossed our faces. 
That uh oh look. 
Like, we’re both in trouble now. 
Nothing has happened but this isn’t going to be ok for anyone involved. 
I ended up getting the job, which paid terribly. 
It was enough to keep enough bourbon in my system and a few cans of cheap beer around the apartment. 
Sometimes not enough to afford more than rolling tobacco. 
I took home chicken carcasses from the restaurant and made soup. 
We ate a lot of chicken soup and black beans with pasta. 
We were poor but it was always just enough to not feel it too much.
When i saw her again and we had to introduce ourselves she told me, “hi. 
I’m Leslie. 
I’ve been pooping funny, lately.” I don’t remember what i said exactly. 
But it was probably nothing noteworthy. 
i was still lying to myself then. 
Thinking i could do my job, ignore everything else and get on with my life. 
Leslie, i found out, was two years older than me. 
Made really good gelato. 
And was married. 
Recently married. 
And i thought, “well, that’s that.” A lot of my thoughts were way off then. 
That’s what you get for being young and thinking. 
I spent a lot of those days getting very drunk. 
Our apartment was near the south Berkeley ghetto, down on Russell and Sacramento. 
My roommate was finishing his english degree at the University and his grandmother was paying his half of the rent. 
The apartment was in her name and i sent her a check every month to cover my expenses. 
Because we were in the ghetto and neither of us had the place in our name, we didn’t care too much what happened to the place. 
We smoked inside, spilled beer all over the hardwood floor. 
Let beans and hot sauce and cheap cheese become part of the oven. 
I had to pass two bars on my way home each night. 
The Acme and The Missouri. 
In those days, there wasn’t much difference. 
The Missouri had a large patio and a pool table. 
The Acme had a pool table. 
You could smoke in the Acme after nine, since the health inspector wasn’t likely to show up. 
There was a glass jug with some mysterious special cocktail that no one ever drank. 
It was a good bar with dim lights and a lot of whiskey. 
The Missouri isn’t much different today. 
I haven’t been very often since then. 
It was our after work bar. 
A watering hole for a lot of the local cooks. 
A lot of things happened at that bar. 
I like to leave it alone.
I’m trying to remember when our first kiss was. 
I’m pretty sure it was on the fourth of july. 
We had gone through several months of flirting and teasing blushing and saying all manner of highly inappropriate things to each other. 
When the fourth came around there was a big party at one of the cooks houses. 
Around Lake Merritt. 
I was on my way when Leslie called. 
She had been drinking early and had a glow about her. 
She waited for me outside. 
When i came up to the place she said, “The neighbors have these fruit trees.” She walked me back to the trees and there was a fence that divided the cooks yard from us. 
She lured me into her trap. 
As soon as we were out of view she pushed me against the fence and put her mouth on mine. 
Months of pent up sexual tension. 
Weeks on weeks of little flutters of feelings. 
And just like that. 
It exploded. 
She pushed me against the fence and kissed me. 
She kissed me in a way that suggested she was starving, dehydrated. 
And she just found a table laden with food and drink. 
She kissed me like all the fireworks in Chinatown simultaneously erupting in a fountain of floral colors. 
Then i kissed her back. 
Then i knew i was gone. 
We made it to the party and i started drinking and smoking with everyone. 
Eating the kind of old fashion barbecue food that cooks and chefs love more than most things. 
We all got drunk and sang along to songs on the stereo and when the sun went down we lit fireworks and walked down to the lake to watch the real fireworks. 
Not that what we burned wasn’t real. 
But the big showstopper fireworks that you can feel the force of the explosion were over the lake. 
We went back to the house and drank more and sang more and then it was time to go because Leslie was leaving i asked her for a ride.
During the ride i must have tried to kiss her again about a dozen times. 
I was very drunk. 
I didn’t understand that what was ok a few hours ago wasn’t as ok now. 
She pulled up to my apartment and in one swift motion, unclicked my seat belt, opened the passenger door and pushed me out on the curb while she was pulling away. 
Apparently, the way to my heart is riddled with abuse. 
After that, there’s a spot of blur. 
I got promoted to grill cook. 
Sometimes i had to work brunch. 
We played the kiss off as nothing to worry about for a little bit. 
I think we did. 
I know we were both really bad about pretending there was nothing going on. 
Then there was a particularly brutal brunch. 
I just remember wave after wave of burgers. 
Eight back on eight back on eight. 
for four straight hours. 
My hungover face dripping sweat into the wood burning grill. 
My arms getting more crisscrossed with burn scars by the minute. 
Spatula in one hand, tongs in the other. 
And plate after plate. 
When it was over, i wanted a drink and a cigarette. 
That’s all i could think about. 
I cleaned my station. 
Prepped for the evening and clocked out. 
I walked to the hotel bar because it was still early. 
I like hotel bars because there’s a very different vibe. 
People coming and going. 
Almost no locals. 
You don’t run into people that know you at a hotel bar. 
I wasn’t in a mood for talking. 
I drank four bourbon and sodas. 
I hadn’t eaten all day. 
In a haze, i walked home. 
I opened the door, went to my room and collapsed in bed. 
Then my phone rang. 
It was Leslie. 
“I just got out. 
Are you ok?”
“Yeah. 
Yeah, i’m just fine.” I said.
“Can I come over?” And i was too tired to know what she meant by that.
“Sure. 
I’m here. 
let me know.”
I opened the door and She pushed her way through. 
She closed the door, and pushed me right back into my bed and closed the door. 
She started kissing me and taking my shirt off. 
Then my pants. 
I was trying to keep up. 
I managed to get most of her clothes off and return some of her kisses. 
we were like two animals just freed from captivity. 
We hungered and thirsted. 
We almost devoured each other. 
There was something violent about that first time. 
You read sex scenes sometimes and it tries to be very sensual and poetic. 
This was more like a cage match. 
We fucked like our lives depended on it. 
We fucked each other for four hours. 
Only pausing to catch our breath. 
Every other sexual encounter I had had until then was rendered null and void. 
Compared to what happened with Leslie, everything before wasn’t sex. 
Just an approximation. 
A rough estimation. 
Before Leslie, I felt like i’d only read about sex in books written by people that heard about it third hand.
The problem was, we fit together. 
Sometimes you meet someone and they just fit right in there. 
In your arms, in your thoughts. 
You laugh at each others jokes, and not politely. 
You like a lot of the same things, but know them from different angles. 
After the sweat cooled on our bodies, we lied in my bed just staring at each other. 
Not saying anything. 
Eyes locked for what seemed an hour. 
Sometimes we smiled. 
Sometimes we looked really concerned. 
Sometimes we just breathed. 
She was still married.
After that day she would call me in the mornings. 
Early, around seven or so. 
Right after her husband went to work. 
Almost every day that he went to work or went out of town. 
“Can I come over? Do you have time for me?” She would say.
And I always said yes. 
Why wouldn’t I? There was nothing for me to lose.
This went on for four months. 
during that time we broke up and got back together about fourteen times. 
we couldn’t be away for long.
And she would always take me places. 
She took me to Indian Rock for the first time. 
Up to Grizzly Peak. 
Out to Korean barbeque where i wouldn’t have been able to order anyway since no one spoke english. 
But the food was always amazing. 
The views were always the kind that kick you in the stomach. 
There was always more than just the sex. 
We told each other, numerous times. 
That this was a very narcissistic relationship. 
We felt like we were dating ourselves. 
And it was mostly true. 
Except she was married. 
And i asked her dumb questions like, “if you weren’t married, would you date me?” 
Then there was a time she took me up by the rose gardens on the hill. 
Right around sunset. 
and we were sitting there and it was all too much and i turned to her. 
and i let that thing come out of my mouth. 
That evil, barbed string of words and binds many and frees nothing. 
I told her that i loved her. 
And she stopped because she knew as well as i did. 
And she said it back. 
We spent several hours kissing and holding each other like, oh shit. 
This just got really complicated. 
Like, you can’t just go back from that. 
Like, the bag gave birth to the cat and now that motherfucker is out for blood. 
My favorite date that we ever went on took place in my room. 
After the restaurant closed and I was out of work and she was working the counter at a pizza place, she came over with some leftovers and a bottle of wine. 
We stayed up passing the bottle back and forth. 
We took turns reading from books to each other and eating pizza. 
We never fucked that night. 
We kissed a little bit. 
We slept together, which only happened when her husband was out of town. 
We slept soundly. 
Peacefully. 
I’ll never forget that night. 
I hope i never forget that night. 
It all ended at some point. 
I don’t really remember the last days much. 
But i knew it was coming. 
It became harder and harder to see her. 
Her marriage was hanging by a thread and she knew it. 
I knew there were other men in her life. 
I didn’t know when or how or why. 
But it happened. 
And like that. 
She was gone. 
And I was broken for a while. 
I didn’t want anything or anyone. 
I didn’t want. 
I couldn’t think. 
There was only a void. 
The ship had left the harbour. 
I saw her a year later. 
Around the time i thought i was moving to new york with my roommate. 
That never happened. 
But we believed it. 
I saw her for a night and we got coffee and caught up. 
When we said goodbye i kissed her. 
I told her to hold me like she wasn’t going to see me for a very long time. 
That much was true.
It wasn’t until recently, about a month ago, that i saw her again. 
The one that got away. 
And that’s what she was. 
And will be. 
I heard she moved to the city and got a good job in the Embarcadero. 
So I sent her a message. 
Let’s get a drink. 
It had been a good three years. 
We had some catching up to do. 
There wasn’t a day in those three years that she didn’t cross my mind. 
Not even one. 
Because i counted. 
Because no one ever got to me like she did. 
I saw her when she just got off work. 
She didn’t do anything to pretty up. 
Her hair was a mess. 
Her clothes were definitely the ones closest to her in the morning. 
She looked just as beautiful as i remembered. 
her face still glowed. 
Her eyes still had this brightness when she saw me. 
And i was the one that worried about my hair, my clothes, how i smelled. 
if my socks matched. 
She didn’t care at all. 
She was happy to see me. 
And i could hardly believe my eyes. 
How long had i waited for this moment. 
How many hours over the years had i thought about this one person and how much she means to me. 
and there she was. 
right there. 
We went and got a drink.
And there are those people. 
It’s been written about and everyone knows them. 
That you don’t see for years and it’s like you just saw them. 
Like time means nothing between you. 
Just a string of events that’s only good for laughs or a moment of silence. 
That was us. 
And laughing like we used to. 
Timed right. 
Our jokes landed on each other. 
Our snarky commentary hit just on point. 
It was a lot like old times. 
Until it was time for me to catch my train home. 
I had work in the morning. 
She walked me to a place that made directions easy. 
And we held each other again. 
I kissed her head and she kissed me back. 
Then she turned around and ran. 
She ran up the hill and back home. 
i saw her again about a month later. 
on a whim i decided to go eat at her restaurant. 
By chance, i ended up sitting at the bar next to the door to the kitchen. 
I sat down just as she was coming out to talk to one of the servers. 
I tried to catch her eye. 
It took a few minutes, but she did a double take. 
She walked into the kitchen then poked her head back out to check. 
And she gave me another one of her hugs. 
Very tight. 
Like she was trying to press herself into me. 
She started taking bandage wrappings out of her pocket and putting them in my lap. 
“This is for you.” she said. 
There was some VIP thing she had to take care of, and off she went. 
I ate very well. 
The food was perfect. 
She came out to see how i was doing. 
I paired a cocktail with each course. 
The bartender was a lovely man. 
He paired a glass of wine as well. 
The wine was on the house. 
I was trying not to get too drunk. 
Enough of a buzz that I was in character. 
But i wanted to remember every detail. 
A fine line that i’ve crossed more often than not. 
Leslie came out with three desserts. 
I ordered a sorbet because that’s all i was feeling like. 
But her pastry work had come a long way. 
Everything had a hint of sweetness. 
Nothing was overbearing. 
Subtle, savoury touches, little bits of “wow, what is that…” It was a beautiful meal. 
It was one of the nicest times i’ve taken myself out. 
She got off work around the time i was finishing up. 
My timing, for once, was spot on. 
She had parked her car in the east bay and took the train over. 
Even better, so i thought. 
I figured i could stay on until North Berkeley, she could give me a ride home, maybe come up for a drink. 
It seemed like a fine plan. 
This is, afterall, what i wanted. 
I had to know. 
I needed to know if all these years away, all this time we’d spent with other people was just an intermission. 
There was a place in my heart that was waiting for an answer to this. 
And it was hardly fair to anyone i dated in the meantime.
On the train, i might have been a little wobbly. 
Certainly all the booze was catching up to me. 
I don’t remember too much about what we talked about. 
But i remember my stop was coming up and i told her about the idea of me staying on and getting a ride back. 
Then she dropped her little bomb on me. 
There was a guy. 
She was trying to get knocked up. 
And that’s when i got off the train. 
The boat was leaving harbour. 
and it wasn’t going to come back. 
Unless this is some kind of Tangled Up in Blue story and we’ll meet again and she’ll have a kid and the man will be gone and god only knows what kind of shit that will be. 
But the chapter closed. 
The end. 
True Story, Never Happened.
When you tell a story to someone, face to face, most of the time it begins like, “So this one time…” or “I remember once…” I barely remember this story, and it just happened.
I’ve worked many a different job growing up. 
My first job was at a library in a small town. 
I shelved books and watched pretty girls do homework. 
My boss was a librarian with a degree. 
Of her age I know nothing. 
She had a magnificent rose garden. 
She was quirky and charming. 
She wore long hippie dresses and lots of necklaces. 
Her hair was a wild chestnut mess of curls. 
I was fourteen at the time and this was a good way to be spending my time after school. 
A year later, while still working at the library I was hired to test software for a friend of the family. 
I had a knack for computers and thought I wanted to become a programmer. 
Maybe a graphic designer. 
Maybe work with video games. 
I didn’t really know. 
After doing the work for a while I found it tedious and dull. 
I spent a lot of my time drinking Coke and chatting to friends. 
After about a year of working with software, I was laid off. 
I had seen a lot of the nonsense that happen in California during was was later called The Bubble. 
 All expense paid trips to San Francisco for a weekend of conferences. 
Booths and booths of various small companies trying desperately to hock their products at sales reps from other companies. 
 There was money everywhere, at the time. 
A friend of a friend had a job description of “Network Monitor”. 
 His job was to make sure the network was running. 
 Not to fix it if something wrong happened. 
Just to watch things. 
Make sure everything’s ok. 
 The building he worked in had a beer tap in the staff room. 
Everything was paid for by the company. 
And he played video games all day. 
And all night. 
He was one of many.
Then everything went to shit. 
I can’t even remember why, exactly. 
Maybe it was the stock market. 
Maybe it was people getting wise to all that money just being thrown around for the hell of it. 
I don’t know. 
Shit happens. 
My next job was a short stint as a web site designer. 
My boss was a large man with a platinum blond comb over. 
His nose Rudolphed. 
 He was creepy. 
And I know creepy is one of those words that could mean many things. 
I’d say he was creepy like a pedophile. 
He had a pedo grin. 
He had beady child molester eyes. 
He always addressed me as either Sport or Bud. 
I latest about two months and then I was fired. 
Fired for trying to download a cartoon. 
Two months later the office was raided by the FBI. 
 I never heard what they were looking for. 
But I’d guess it was child pornography. 
I went to college for a while. 
It was alright but I never settled on a real major. 
Instead I started working at a video store in the same small town where the library was. 
The video store was small. 
I saw the same people, the same families, the same people that worked next door. 
I worked with a fat guy named Will. 
Will spent most of his time watching movies or making out with his fat girlfriend. 
 Sometimes he would do both. 
Sometimes he also ate pizza from the place next door. 
 I remember seeing the two of them, greasy faced, and slobbering all over each other. 
Right behind the counter. 
In view of the front window. 
It was grotesque.
My boss was another fat man. 
This time with a fat wife and two terrible little children. 
 The children were hellraisers. 
 Loud and obnoxious and full of energy and whining. 
My fat boss was always fighting with his fat wife or the insane children. 
He was, aside from a loving father, a nerd and a pervert. 
He liked guns. 
 He was also an awful manager. 
I found his notebook at work one time. 
He spied on me and called from his car. 
He distrusted everyone. 
While I may have broke trust by reading the notebook, he disgusted me. 
He loved being the boss and breaking his own rules. 
I worked my ass off for some reason. 
 It was a video store and there’s really not a whole lot of ass busting that needs to happen. 
But I did a damn good job with what I was given. 
I have, at least, a good work ethic. 
I can work hard and pick up after other people with no complaints. 
It doesn’t really bother me that much. 
But then a friend of mine got me a job at a warehouse packaging French car parts.
I quit the video store and commuted an hour every morning to a city that is predominately populated by Mexicans. 
My boss’s name was Miles Potter and he worked from a trailer inside the building. 
The warehouse was all shelving and workbench. 
We spent a lot of time putting exhaust pipes in bins or stacking radiators. 
We shipped windshields and doors. 
Wipers, fans, and seats. 
It was a good jungle gym. 
We had a fork lift at our disposal. 
My friend that got me the job worked at photographing parts for a catalog. 
My other coworkers were a fat redheaded girl named Cory and her cousin, Gabe. 
Gabe and Cory also lived together. 
They were two of the biggest stoners and drunks I’d ever met. 
We had a good time together, ate a lot of Mexican food and smoked a lot of weed. 
It was an easy job and paid more than any job I’d had before. 
Aside from the commute, it was wonderful. 
Then I started getting interested in food.
I’d had to cook for myself growing up. 
My mother and father both worked nights for a time. 
Food became serious business when I turned twenty. 
I still remember the sweetbreads I ate on my birthday. 
I had been talking to a friend about food for a while and we both loved to cook. 
She suggested that I get serious about it and drop my dreams of being an artist. 
My then girlfriend had moved back to Idaho to be with her family at the time and this seemed like a good chance to go back to school, get out of town and be with the girl. 
I signed up for culinary school in Boise, Idaho. 
The school was small and low budget. 
The chefs were mostly soft cooks that had failed to hack it at a real restaurant. 
They were always in-fighting and picking favorites. 
The other students were a mix of talented, driven cooks and people that were lost and thought that cooking for a living was an answer. 
I fell in more with the ones that wanted to be chefs in their own restaurants. 
 The ones that would have study sessions at the nearest dive bar. 
These were my kind of people. 
I made it through one semester and my student loans ran out. 
There was an advertisement for a dishwasher on the bulletin board at school. 
I walked in to the building wearing a white chef coat and black pants. 
The uniform. 
 It was a seafood steakhouse. 
 Idaho was a steak and potatoes kind of place. 
It was also, I later learned, one of the top five restaurants in the city. 
The chef and the sous chef were both graduates from the school I was in. 
The chef’s name was Dustin but I still only call him Chef. 
He was a tall man with broad shoulders. 
He had thick black hair and a well manicured beard. 
Both ears were pierced with large silver rings. 
He always wore blue tinted prescription sunglasses. 
He had above everything else, a fantastic sense of humor. 
There was a lot of laughter in that kitchen. 
He never let me touch the dish pit and put me on at night, working the pantry. 
The pantry station is where all the deserts and salads and sometimes, appetizers come from at a restaurant. 
Sometimes it’s also called cold side. 
Hot side is where the grill and broil stations are. 
I was trained by a short Hispanic lesbian named Rose. 
She was adorable in character and appearance. 
 I jumped at a chance to do everything. 
I was eager, ready to help any way that I could. 
I would ask her about every ticket that came in. 
I was really annoying.
The summer came and while off from school I worked full time. 
I was improving quickly at my job and taking on more responsibilities. 
 I became the prep cook. 
The prep cook touches every dish that goes out. 
The prep cook is responsible for the quality of everything everyone else had to cook. 
The prep cook also has his own kitchen to work in. 
The typical shift was from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon when the dinner service started. 
 I would work until six or seven then sit in the bar drinking our company’s micro brews and then walking home to my apartment. 
The summer passed by then came time for school again. 
Trying to balance school, work and the girlfriend hit me hard. 
I was stressed out to the point of shitting blood. 
 I went to see the doctors. 
They said acid reflux. 
Stress. 
Lack of sleep. 
Bad diet. 
Stop smoking. 
Don’t drink so much. 
Instead of listening to them I dropped out of school and told my girlfriend that I was moving to Seattle with or without her. 
 She chose to stay. 
And I never made it to Seattle. 
Ending our six years together.
Then I started making friends at work. 
We started hanging out at bars and strip clubs. 
I was having fun. 
No one bothered me about smoking cigarettes any more. 
Or drinking too much. 
Excess was encouraged. 
Cooks are notorious for their drinking.
he scariest thing is the blank page. 
so i’m just going to type until it goes away. 
first a few words to warm up the old fingers. 
get things moving. 
rusty. 
that’s what i’ve been but another november is upon us which means it’s time. 
time to stop making excuses and just sit down and do it. 
my foot is hurting anyway. 
lots of walking the last few days. 
so it’s sunday anyway and that’s a day of rest. 
the mechanics are a slow. 
i can’t remember how to type fast. 
lots of errors. 
backspaces. 
that sort of thing. 
it’s been too long and i’m way out of practice. 
anyway plow on. 
keep going also i need to break out of the habit of double spaces after a new line. 
but it’s just so hard wired into my now. 
I have a slight hangover for the first time in months. 
since july. 
I guess it’s kinda nice at this point. 
like an old friend stopping by for a visit. 
jesus my words per minute must be attrocious. 
but no matter just keep typing.
so we’re going to write a story for november and it’s going to be a november story. 
I have done no planning for this project aside from a passing thought about it every other day. 
Nothing has been committed to paper digital or traditional. 
i have a jug of tea and a vaporizer for nicotine. 
Because i’m living in the future. 
this is all just greasing the wheel to get the idea of writing back in my brain. 
It’s not like riding a bike. 
Besides with my injury, the whole bike riding metaphor is a big old fuck you. 
it’s just like riding a bike. 
except you front tire gets stuck in the muni track and end up smashed on the pavement with a broken wrist and a broken ankle. 
and you’ve been in bed since July. 
you’ve been in bed for 4 months. 
one third of a year. 
Chirst that’s a bit of time. 
you could have done so much. 
you could have writing. 
been writing, learned something read something worked on your upper body, learned a language. 
learned to code. 
done something. 
played games, watched movies and tv shows. 
scanned millions of ports and several hundred servers. 
mapping targets. 
Because we’re at war. 
we’ve been at war and the battlefield is digital and physical at the same time. 
every day life is at stake, your identity is at stake. 
everything you’ve grown comfortable with is at stake. 
So i’m going to write about the global cold war. 
Cold war two. 
i suppose that i was reasearching this whole thing because i’ve been reading the news everyday. 
mostly the tech. 
but since we’re moving into an election year, it’s been pretty interesting. 
so in this story we have some major players. 
The US and Russia. 
China, Syria, the UK, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, korea, India, Romania, We have corperations like google, microsoft and apple. 
tesla, symantic, various labs, LBL should be in there for old times sake. 
University campuses should have a spot but we can’t get too spread out. 
We don’t have time to go that far. 
We have various hacker collectives, in all the countries listed above. 
We have some everyday normal people that get caught up in the storm. 
We build the storm and break it. 
So lets’ see…
Our main dude should be someone with a blasie day job. 
something fairly mundane, but gives him time to pursue his hobby, which is infosec. 
he doesn’t have a wife or kids or many friends, he has a few online aquainteces. 
but thats about it. 
He should be a busboy. 
because i can write that. 
OK. 
so he works at a small restaurant for some armenians. 
We’re writing a techothriller at heart here so we need to keep that in mind. 
Perspective is key. 
We should open with his studio apartment. 
-----------
Bird noise. 
That was always a tip. 
He had been at it all night again. 
When your hobby is like a second job, and your first job gets out around one in the morning. 
you start late, you finish late. 
The coffee has been cold for hours now and his ashtray is overflowing. 
The carpet has ash stains. 
bits of old pizza. 
clothes strewn about because he doesn’t care. 
He got home, turned the screens on and watched. 
He left for work that afternoon and before he did he set up a scan. 
He always sets up a scan before he leaves. 
It can take hours. 
and might as well not let that processing power go to waste. 
He’s jacked into the neighbors WiFi, routing through a VPN, proxied to TOR. 
What that means is that his connection is about one fifth what it normally is. 
Things can take a while to go over the pipe. 
The block he’s scanning belongs to a community college in Ohio. 
he’s been chipping away at their network for weeks. 
Slowing building a map. 
He needs to know everything. 
the goal is to gain nodes for his botnet. 
He doesn’t have a plan for his collection. 
But it’s nice to know it’s there. 
Sneak in, gain access, maintain hiding. 
He’s never destructive. 
That’s not the goal. 
The goal isn’t really that clear to him at the moment.
The birds are chirping outside his balcony. 
inside one of his screens is streaming text. 
verbose output from a block of IP addresses. 
Digital ping pong. 
His computer sending a signal through the neighbors router, bouncing it off a server in the east cost, over the atlantic, through germany, down to egypt, back to the UK, over to Ohio, across town to the community college campus, to a computer lab. 
The signal is saying HEY HELLO! and it’s waiting for an answer that says OH HEY! I”M HERE! when that happens the scan will ask a few more questions, like what are you? what do you do? what version are you running? how much information are you willing to give me?
It used to be easier before firewalls became standard practice. 
Now he has to go slowing, fragment the packets, try to evade detection. 
Not raise any eyebrows over in Ohio. 
He’s looking for machinces that have been neglected by the administrator. 
Something forgotton. 
It’s more common at college campuses. 
With computers in every room and labs set up all over the place, something is bound to be missed. 
Sometimes a machine can go with being updated for years. 
And all it takes is one loose bolt. 
One default user account. 
One unpatched program.
His screen stops scrolling. 
The scan has found something interesting. 
The box was set up for students to learn the basics of running a web server. 
That means it has several open ports. 
21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443, 445. 
That’s enough to start. 
He probes further. 
FTP, SSh, Telnet, Sendmail, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and Samba. 
Goldmine. 
He pokes until he learns the version of each piece of software on the other end. 
The version of sendmail hasn’t been updated in a few years. 
He knows there’s a hole in the code that he can squirm into. 
He makes notes about the server, the address, the open ports and any other information he’s got at this point. 
In another terminal he opens a script. 
The script opens the hole by wedging a small block of code into the process. 
The code casues the software to slip into the root account. 
He now has priviledges. 
He makes a new account with equal access. 
He goes through the logs and erases the evidence. 
He makes some notes. 
He pokes around the server, checking out what he’s got. 
what he’s connected to. 
He grabs the list of usernames and passwords, encrypted for now. 
He logs out of the computer in ohio, the UK, Egypt, Germany, Boston, and the neighbors. 
he types a command that opens a program that starts the long process of cracking the encrypted passwords he just stole. 
It’s not the longest list. 
It’s only going to take a few days. 
He turns the monitor off. 
He walks to the balcony and lights a cigarette. 
He sits and smokes and watches the birds. 
The birds are pinging each other too. 
He flicks the cigarette butt off the baclony, closes the door, closes the blinds, crawls into bed and shuts down.

ok a rough start. 
that’s for sure. 
it’s to be expected. 
I haven’t done this in a long time. 
Besides, trying to make technical writing exciting is quite a task. 
I’m not sure where to go from here. 
but that’s what begingings are for. 
Maybe we should back of the tech shit for a minute and find another character to pick at. 
Since i have nothing in mind this is going to be interesting. 
One goal for this project is to leave romance and sex out of it. 
Which means, i don’t know. 
more politics i suppose. 
It’s going to be a challange but that’s what this is all about anyway. 
challangers like the challanger exploding into a million shiny bits all floating back to earth in a big blaze of gory. 
We can do this. 
focus. 
ficus, fingerpaints. 
aliviate alliteration anxiety try our thought process today tons of satisfied costuomers. 
tumors and rumors and ballon animal misfit food fight down right scray subliminal animal magnets. 
mezmerizing mexican food allegories stories and something something… bang on and on and tap and tips and ticka ticka ticker tape parade and it’s almost thanksgiving. 
grieving and relieaving and other nonsense. 
ok ok ok. 
back to it keep going until the fingers fall off or get in line and line em up and rail it down and my god it’s been a long time since i’ve coked the caine. 
choked the chain and smoked a plain jane mary. 
drug metaphors maybe, it’s been a while since i’ve been out of my head and maybe that’s not such a good thing. 
I have that salvia sitting around somewhere. 
but i don’t know about that. 
there’s still plenty of weed. 
more than i could smoke unless i went back to my stoner days. 
lets’ not deviate reinstate or statis. 
 one of that thank you lets keep the ball rolling don’t mind the wrist cramping. 
keep going pound away type type typists and AND…
well that petered out pretty quickyly lets’ see if the rolling ball can provide some more inspiration for our tale. 
Told by toddlers and tell tale taxiderminsts determinest dermal dremel detriments. 
a fun game is seeing how many words are words and which ones are just sounds that i’m throwing together in a kind of what just happened thing. 
oh well whatever nevermind. 
thanks Kurt. 
i guess.
I’ve managed to get over the daily minimum word count, but most of it is garbage. 
that’s ok i guess. 
because i’m starting all over again. 
anyway. 
this story has nothing. 
I have a rough idea and even then there’s nothing. 
cold war two, world wide and real is actually a thing that’s happening right now. 
The fact that we’re on the edge of hot war with china, already in it with Syria, Afganistan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt. 
That makes it easier and more difficult. 
I can draw on real world events. 
but at the same time i’m trying to write fiction. 
well, fictionesque.
Changing the pace to old cowboy music. 
let’s see where that takes us. 
We’re talking about digital cowboys anway. 
So lets get on it.
-------------
“what do we know so far?”
The board room is a long oval table with a confrence call device in the middle. 
The table is seated by eight people ranging in ethnic backrounds, mostly in their thirties. 
Mostly men. 
everyone has a laptop in front of them. 
some also have tablets, cell phones.
“We know the attacks have been coming in from China. 
We know they’ve compromised two data centers in the last month. 
One in Los Angeles, one in Seattle. 
The extent of the breech has yet to be determined. 
Potentially, they could have everything. 
They’d need some heavy storage to keep it.” A man says.
“Goddamnit.” The man at the end of the table swivels in his chair, facing a large whiteboard. 
There’s a diagram on the board that has lines drawn between several nodes. 
Addresses of each part of the chain. 
“Are the Chinese going to work with us on this?” He swivels back around to face the table.
“No response yet,” a young woman replies. 
“Our contacts at China Telecom are aware of the attacks, from what we can tell, are pursuing action.” She taps a stylus on the table.
“
-----
I looked around the room, at the table of people seated around it.
disgusting. 
Just look at them. 
All of them. 
pathetic bunch. 
And there they all are, being the sick, sad sacks of shit I’ve known all my life. 
Everywhere i go, there they are. 
It really just makes you want to puke all over everything.
At the end of the table is a pervert. 
He scratches his shitty beard. 
His beard hides his stupid chin. 
His chin hides the fat on his neck. 
His voice is weak. 
He sweats when he talks. 
His laughter is nervous. 
And he laughes at everything. 
Nothing genuine. 
That’s not in his capacity. 
He doesn’t even know how to authenticate his emotions. 
All he knows is lust. 
Greedy and all consuming. 
His eyes are small and fat from his face gives the appearance that his features are sinking into his skull. 
His eyes shift and refocus constantly. 
He’s like a man paranoid that someone can read his mind. 
They can see the poison of his thoughts. 
IF you could read him for even a minute you wouldn’t be able to eat, you’d lose your appetite. 
Your slab of new york stripe would turn into a grey wad of rotting flesh. 
He’s laughing at the girl to his left.
Lefty is a vapid little shit too. 
She’s got a shirt on a size too small. 
It gets her attention. 
She needs that attention or she would die. 
Oh my god she would just die right there. 
you don’t even know. 
she’s not even telling a story. 
she says things like oh wow, that’s sooooo funny. 
she doesn’t laugh. 
she doesn’t even smile. 
she smiles when it’s over because she thinks the person she’s not listening to is full of shit. 
He is full of shit and we’ll get to him next. 
As long as someone is looking at her. 
She would just wilt into a puddle if no one looked in her direction every few seconds. 
She would just die. 
IF no one is looking in her direction she’ll make a noise, a cough, a sneeze, clear her throat and say oh it’s nothing, like don’t worry about little ol’ me. 
She’s not listening because she doesn’t have to. 
There won’t be a quiz. 
The talk is cheap and the food is garbage and the wine is overpriced old grape juice that was made from bad grapes in a bad year. 
No one is going to admit it. 
If you didn’t pay close attention you’d think everyone was having such a good time. 
You might even think they’re such nice people. 
You’d be wrong. 
These are your friends, and because you think they are your friends you will forgive them over and over again. 
You will believe them when they apologize for missing your birthday, for standing you up on a date, for not showing up to your funeral because of a scheduling conflict.
OUr story teller is a case. 
A case of arrested development. 
a case of the wiggles. 
drinking problem, shaking hands, can’t remember what he’s saying just has to keep talking because when he talks people listen because he keeps talking and if you have something else to say he’ll find something to say too except he will say so much more and keep going on and on about everything he can think of. 
He thinks fast, lies fast, his mind working in a frenzy to attach details, to make sense of it in his own mind split seconds before spitting it out, gesturing wildly with his wine glass, making just enough care not to spill it on the table. 
this is wine after all. 
and wine is classy. 
classy people drink wine and it makes them feel important.
further down the table we have a rich widow because every good story needs one. 
She’s mostly quiet. 
Her husband died last year and she hasn’t been happier. 
the old fart finally kicked it and the worst part was how long it took from the start of the dying until he was actually in the ground. 
she thought it would never end. 
laying on his deathbed. 
constantly whining. 
oh my pain. 
oh my suffering. 
god, just shut up and die already. 
the finger her wedding band was on getting thinner every day. 
the ring getting looser. 
she fiddles with it by his death bed. 
spinning it around on her finger. 
the shackle trying to break free. 
just a little longer. 
she can make it. 
she looks at her husband, his skin splotchy and marked, liver spots, and skin getting loose around his bones. 
She can’t wait until this is over. 
Just a little longer and everything he worked for, everything his father worked for, would be hers. 
She earned it by playing nice for the last twenty years. 
she earned it by listening this his complaints about his various illnesses, his allergies, his achy bones, his sore muscles, his paranoid delusions about the maids, his problems with the ethnics, what was happening to his country. 
And she held his hand the whole time, telling him to hush now, feeding him pain killers, letting the nurse feed him because he would drool and dribble the liquified food out of the corners of his mouth. 
She couldn’t watch that. 
The rest of it she could stomach, but the food coming out again was too much. 
She would leave the room. 
To her credit, she waited until the end to do anything that would be considered inappropriate. 
As soon as he was in the ground, as soon as all the people at the wake were done pretending that they cared, as soon as the other relatives went home, the flowers started dying, the nurse went home for the last time. 
As soon as everything was cleaned up and the staff at the house was replaced. 
the rooms redecorated the way she always wanted but he never did. 
She sent everyone out, she sat down in the study and pulled one of his cigars off the mantle, she cut it with the silver cigar cutter, poured a healthy snifter of his prized presidente brandy, and lit a big fire in the fireplace. 
And his pictures started piling up in the flames, his diploma, his degrees, his awards, all of it. 
Everything she could find. 
and she sat by the fire, smoking his cigar and drinking his brandy and she spit on the last remainders and reminders of his life.
At the table she wears a lovely evening dress and a tight valium infused smile. 
She just smiles at everyone and doesn’t say much. 
She’s not listening either, she’s just here to make face, as they say. 
to be seen out and about since the ever so unfortunate passing of her dear late husband. 
Late for what?
Late to come to his senses.
There are a few more people at the table. 
We don’t care about them. 
They don’t care about them. 
No one does. 
they don’t have the capacity. 
Who cares. 
They’re all garbage anyway. 
At least the wine is good.
-----
It’s people like this that make me not believe in government surveillance. 
Because if someone had to listen to these people. 
if someone had to sift through all this human garbage, if you had a job for a government to monitor all the communications in the country looking for signals of treachery, you’d eat a handful of pills, pop a bullet in your head, or take an automatic rifle into a shopping mall on the day after thanksgiving and the sound of the gun and the screaming people running and trying not to die would be the sweetest music. 
if you had to pay attention to other people, you’d be too depressed or pissed off to go on living in a world where this was considered normal.
-----
“are you all finished up here?” the plate is mostly empty and no one has touched anything except the wine for over thirty minutes, but when you’re a busboy you still have to make sure.
“Would you like me to pack this up for you? take it home? yeah? No. 
ok. 
Great.” And around the whole table he goes, trying as hard as possible not to listen to anything they are saying.
He takes the plates to the kitchen and scraps off the uneaten food, throws the silverware into the sink, into a rack ment for the forks and knives and spoons and such. 
He stacks the plates up by size. 
Tonight he’s lucky in one respect. 
The dishwasher isn’t an asshole. 
It’s a tuesday and Fernando is working and Fernando is not an asshole. 
Jose is an asshole and he works tomorrow. 
Jose yells at the busboy every time he brings him more work to do. 
Especially towards the end of the shift when he’s been drinking since his first job in the morning. 
That’s when Jose just gets mean about everything. 
But not tonight. 
Tonight's Fernando. 
And he’s the nicest person in the world. 
Fernando has never said anything to the busboy. 
He just smiles because he’s happy to have a job and not have a second family to send the money to. 
Just his mother and sister. 
No wife no kids no worries. 
No worries at the moment. 
Later his mother will get very sick and Fernando will have to work more and send more money and won’t have time to visit until the end when the doctors that didn’t know what they were doing will make a horrible mistake that will cost his mother her life and no one will learn anything from the whole experience.
But that’s not really part of this story.
The busboy scraps the food off the plates and smiles at Fernando he smiles back and they both just want to do their jobs and get paid and go home. 
It’s been a bit of a bullshit tuesday. 
The money’s not going to be great. 
it’ll be enough for a pack of smokes on the way home and can of freeze dried coffee. 
The busboy might even pick up couple of microwaveable sandwiches. 
He’ll scrape up whatever leftovers the kitchen is going to relinquish for the night and it might last him until his next shift. 
it’s his weekend and he has so much work to do you wouldn’t even believe it. 
nothing he’s getting paid for, but that’s fine by him. 
there are other things besides money.
he gets off the bus around one in the morning and walks five blocks to his apartment and opens the door to the building and walks up a flight of stairs, he opens his apartment door and turns his screens on. 
it’s going to be another long night and he has a whole new network to explore. 
he brews a pot of coffee and leaves the to go container, still slightly above room temperature on the table. 
he doesn’t sit down until he can pour one cup of coffee and he gets to work.
-----
ok a much better start this time. 
i think we got something going. 
now maintain it and let it breath and give it life and push it around and make everything worse for everyone.
--------------
Screens. 
every where he looked there was a screen. 
People with screens in their faces, cabs with screens in the dashboard, screens built into the passenger seat. 
screens mounted next to more screens and flashing pulsing colors and sounds and people talking with background music and sound bites and advertisements. 
everything in full color copyright digital artifacting dripping with dollar signs. 
The screens were inescapable. 
in the subway were more screens, on the buildings there were screens. 
in the buildings, rooms and room from end to end full of them. 
all of them relentlessly broadcasting. 
an endless array of marketing. 
pretty soon they’re going to make it so you can’t turn them off. 
as long as it’s plugged in, always on. 
always there for you, your every need, all your hopes and dreams and desires, one click away, just swipe here, enter your email address, your phone number, your full name, date of birth, last four digits of your social security number. 
city you were born in, name of your first boyfriend, girlfriend, mother’s maiden name, we can’t ask for father’s middle names because half the population doesn’t know that. 
Half the population doesn’t know their father’s first name. 
and we can’t ask a security question that a large group of people can’t answer because there is no answer. 
not even on the birth certificate. 
not one government record because mommy didn’t know. 
for all mommy knows it could have been anyone. 
My old bartender used to joke that she was half Irish and half milkman. 
back when milk men were a thing. 
Looking back, she might have been serious. 
and i wonder how many other people would be serious about that sort of thing.
It’s getting worse too. 
Used to be cash or check. 
now it’s cash, check, credit, debit, pay with your phone, email a payment, send a payment over text, set up auto pay, pay when you’re within a ten foot radius of our convenient electronic kiosk. 
you’re pre-approved. 
don’t worry about it. 
would you like to auto-complete the checkout form? would you like to save your information with the server for future transactions? would you like to take your paycheck, put it into the bank, take a picture of it and send it to the bank, sign up for direct deposit, all we need is your social security card, your driver's license, a sample of your blood, a voided check so we can copy down the routing number. 
just put your fingers in the ink and press them to this paper. 
don’t worry, we won’t share your personal details with anyone. 
Why bother? we give it up to anyone that asks.
Do you know what social engineering is? that’s an exploitation of the culture of trust. 
We trust too much. 
we have faith in people to be good. 
we have faith in the company line. 
we have faith that nothing bad will ever happen to us. 
We’re good people we pay our taxes. 
we go to work on time. 
we show up for school. 
We stay in line at the grocery store. 
we stay in line in our cars. 
we stay in line at the voting booths. 
And we cast ballots that say that we’re perfectly ok with everything. 
That all of this is fine with us. 
The system works. 
and the system is working us. 
Make no mistake, you’re going to anyway, there’s no use in me telling you. 
You’re making mistakes right now. 
your phone? the thing you stare at in place of actual human interaction? your social media replacing social interaction? that thing in your purse, in your hands and in your face all day every day is a beacon. 
constantly broadcasting your location, your private details. 
it even has a microphone and a camera on it. 
they don’t even have to try anymore. 
because they sold it to us and we bought it and we love them for it. 
we love them so much that we subscribe to them. 
we shell out more and more every year for the privilege and opportunity to be more connected. 
to share more and more of our selves, pictures of our toast at breakfast, pictures of us trying on pants, selfies with our friends, in front of statues, bathroom selfies, look at me look at me look at me look at my lunch, look at my vacation look at my life my children my family my friends and all the fun we’re having all the time because it’s a nonstop party train and you can watch it all in little chunks and give us likes. 
give us upvotes, give us points. 
validate my existence. 
tell me i’m pretty. 
tell me that looks like fun. 
tell me my sandwich looks delicious and you want a bite. 
tell me that you’re jealous. 
i’m feeding on your envy. 
because at the end of the day, i’m scrolling through the feed to. 
wondering what everyone else is doing. 
wondering what everyone is up to.
you want to know what the government’s top secret super surveillance program is? it’s social media. 
congratulations, suckers. 
you did it to yourselves. 
you coded it, set it free. 
you made the sign up sheets. 
Every day you made it easier. 
and now you’ve created a monster. 
and now the machine has become so big that no one can see it anymore.
it’s only a matter of time before likes become our next form of currency. 
it’s only a matter of time. 
just you wait. 
just watch. 
and whatever you do, don’t stop watching. 
don’t take your eyes off it for a second. 
As soon as you look away, that’s when the predator strikes. 
And believe me honey. 
it’s going right for the neck. 
it’s going to get you right where it counts. 
and it’s not letting go until you and me and everyone we know is little more than a rag doll, limp and lifeless.
I am one of them. 
and so are you. 
so let’s all log in.
--------------
Down in what some people call the south china seas, a US naval vessel is cutting a path. 
The ship doesn’t care. 
As far as The US of A is concerned it’s all their water anyway. 
not on paper. 
not in loose peace treaty sense. 
they really don’t care when it comes down to. 
if they want to break trail for a shortcut what’s the harm in cutting the line from a to b. 
no harm no foul, right? but that’s not how it’s seen. 
from the perspective of the bully, they allow others to borrow the space. 
from the perspective of everyone else it can look like an act of aggression. 
but when you’re the bully, it doesn’t even matter. 
swatting flies. 
that’s how you see the world. 
pests. 
everything else is just a pest that you have to stop what you’re doing and deal with. 
did it matter that economically, the bully was wrong. 
did it matter that morally, religiously, politically, the bully thinks they’re in the right? only to the bully. 
who makes the rules about this sort of thing? the one with the gun.
survival of the fittest. 
who has the gun. 
if everyone has the gun, who has the biggest gun? when everyone has a big gun, who has the bomb. 
who has the biggest bomb. 
who has the launch codes. 
in a basement under a restaurant in hong kong there’s a group of five guys in their thirties. 
and they have all of those things. 
the launch codes, the means to push the button, a way to null and void every peace talk every awkward talk between world powers. 
five dudes in a basement in hong kong, a loose collective in romania, in russia they’re more spread out, in the USA, it’s all over the place. 
Fifteen year olds living in the attic of grandma’s house, displaced black teens in Chicago’s south side, a large chunk of twenty somethings in New York’s five boroughs. 
A latino hacktivist population that spans from Mexico city to Buenos Aries. 
And in all of these places there’s a belief that they have a piece of the puzzle, a piece of the pie. 
Some semblance of control. 
What they don’t know and you don’t know and no one wants to believe is that, they actually do. 
With one phone call, one email, a text message, the whole thing can be undermined. 
Every vote you’ve ever cast, everything you ever cared about, your savings account, your IRA, your stocks, your shitty studio apartment with the stains in the carpet from the previous tenant's dog, your local dive bar, breakfast joint, sandwich shop. 
the corner store where you get your lotto tickets, and a six pack on a saturday night. 
All of it, gone. 
even if the bomb doesn’t drop. 
even if the trigger doesn’t get pulled. 
the banks and all the numbers could just go away. 
And those pieces of paper in your wallet, if you’re antiquated enough to still do that, what will they be if  o one know how much value they have anymore. 
All of it. 
The deed to your house, your insurance plans, every measure you’ve ever taken to ensure that one day you might be ok. 
something to get you through the last years of your life. 
all of it. 
could in the click of a mouse, in the decisive click of the enter key, be gone. 
Then what do you have. 
do you have survival skills. 
do you have anything to contribute. 
can you grow your own food. 
can you produce electricity. 
is your handwriting legible. 
will you matter anymore?

part of me wants to revisit the board room. 
the company that’s caught up in the middle of the whole situation. 
because that’s real. 
that’s been a thing on the news the last few months. 
Not explicitly. 
but it’s implied. 
Another part of me wants to go all kowloon city bladerunner on this story but i don’t know. 
i’m thinking too much about other things and that’s kind of a problem. 
too many cats and distractions at home right now, hardly got anything done yesterday and ended up going to sleep, drunk, tired, and mad.
i’m not drunk anymore, but my head sure feels like shit. 
i’ve still got plenty to be mad about though. 
i guess i should do some world building.
-----
It’s been called one of the most dangerous cities in the world. 
It’s small. 
Most people wouldn’t call it a city. 
everything is beige and grey. 
Apartment buildings clumped together in chunks rising from the ground in several stories of state sponsored concrete and rebar. 
everything has this cheap industrialism feel to it. 
windows that are unbroken haven’t been washed in years. 
trash piles up around the edge of the streets. 
the less fortunate scrap together anything that will burn and gather around garbage can fires. 
the town is surrounded by mountains and dense forest. 
there’s not a lot of traffic on the roads. 
almost everything that goes in and out of this places does so on a wire. 
The logging roads are well outside of city limits. 
All of that gets shipped out of the country anyway. 
No one can afford the local lumber. 
No one is building anything new anyway. 
At least, nothing made out of wood. 
Circuit boards, yes.
There’s a guy in forties hunched over a workbench, soldering transistors on a dull green board. 
he keeps his beard trimmed back so he doesn’t set himself on fire. 
His hands work carefully, attaching antennas and sensors. 
This is a prototype, and it’s a contract job. 
The man doesn’t ask more than nessesary questions. 
he knows his work is going to be used for criminal purposes. 
He knows because he’s been in and out of gangs, mobs, you name it. 
He’s just trying to make a living. 
so is everyone else in the town. 
He doesn’t worry about the cops here. 
He just pays them once a month as protection money. 
Besides, the cops are also customers. 
He makes the bugs they use to extort citizens. 
The cops aren’t interested in locking anyone up, that’s a last resort. 
They’d much rather add someone to the ever growing list of people paying for protection. 
There’s a lot of people with guns in this town. 
and a lot of people that don’t care about taking life to get whatever they want.
On the floor above him there’s a bunch of kids hanging out, young, mostly male. 
They’re involved in the cities most beloved pastime, drafting scams. 
Most of the kids are pretending to be women in various internet forums. 
They are building elaborate stories to convince people around the world to give them money. 
Money for their sick mothers, surgery, plane tickets to come visit. 
And it works more often than you would think. 
A fool and his money, they say.
---
when it comes down to it, i guess this story is really about trust. 
we, as human beings are so very trusting of each other. 
While we indulge ourselves in crime stories and the nightly news and we all think, that won’t happen to me. 
No one is going to bother to hack my email, no one i know would ever do anything like that. 
we want to believe that people are naturally good natured, that the interests of the individual are outweighed by the collective need, despite there never being any evidence to suggest this was ever a thing. 
We trust our parents, our teachers, our friends, our co-workers. 
we trust the system. 
we trust common institutions like marriage and monogamous relationships. 
we trust ourselves. 
I’m not trying to play whistleblower here. 
i’m not trying to reinvent the wheel or show you anything that isn’t already out in the open. 
I just want to know why you’re ignoring it. 
what makes everyone think they’re above the law, or above criticism. 
above an audit from the IRS, or profiling at the airport. 
what made us so arrogant as a species that we created all of these things, we created broken systems, and broken methods, and a broken way of life. 
we trust that everything is going to be alright. 
Deep down we all know this isn’t right. 
that it’s only a matter of time. 
Entropy is what i’m getting at. 
The only true thing that eventually, everything is going to break down. 
Everyone you know and love will betray you giving the circumstances. 
you will lie and betray yourself more often than not. 
A false sense of security is the most prevalent, widely damaging state of mind that we as a species have been cultivating for years. 
we love to kid ourselves. 
we overspend, confident that more money will come back to us. 
we make deals on future promises that just because it’s happened before, means it will keep happening. 
We’ve tricked ourselves and everyone around us into thinking that we have our shit together. 
Even when we know that every action you make unless you live off the grid completely, makes you just another marketing statistic. 
we look at the world around us so often that we don’t see anything anymore. 
not being able to see the forest for the trees was the old expression. 
I wonder how that will translate after the forests are gone except on old BBC documentaries. 
part of me is truely worried about the future. 
Part of me is scared shitless about the trajectory of the human race. 
The other part of me believes that we deserve every terrible thing that happens. 
Because no matter what, we earned it. 
These things happen because we laid every brick to get there. 
We went from living in caves and later huts with fields of grain, to drawing up maps with lines that made everyone aware of ownership. 
the exact placement of the lines was often disputed, leading to territorial wars, still happening after several hundred years of heavily documented history. 
We’re still pulling the this land is my land, your land is my land card. 
Except the ones claiming ownership are states and institutions and corporations. 
You probably think i’m paranoid, and the old addage holds true that if you think that, you’re not paying attention. 
This is all out in the open. 
IN the last few years, there been a greater lack of denial, because they don’t need to anymore. 
everyone is pretty much ok with it.
I don’t know when we all gave up. 
but we did. 
and the it’s too late now bit is also true. 
We can either live with it, or burn it all down and start over. 
I know you’re thinking, but what about all the protests that have happened in the last year? what about all the anger and outrage? what about the activists on Twitter and Facebook, what about the Arab Spring?
Has any of it made a damn bit of difference? I don’t think so. 
I’m not seeing anything change. 
Same shit, different day. 
you can throw a politician out of office, but if you replace him with another politician, what has been accomplished? nothing has. 
protesting has never accomplished anything and it never will. 
Not until we collectively recognize that the system is broken and we need to start over from scratch. 
draft new laws, new rules and a new system of checks and balances. 
you can’t argue that corruption isn’t present, that it’s not going to happen. 
It will, it always has. 
And until we can figure out a way to do away with the idea of politics, we’ll never be free of it. 
I’ll get into the militarization of the police force in another rant. 
but i’m starting to fizzle out on this topic. 
I already have a hard to talking to people because everything i say seems so obvious, so repetitive. 
why bother talking? if i have to say obvious things, what’s the point. 
if it’s new to you then you haven’t been listening to anything going in the world around for years, maybe your whole life. 
And i don’t have any faith in you starting because I said something. 
I really don’t know what the point of writing this is anymore. 
this has become an exercise for the the sake of exercise. 
i don’t have a message or a story or a plot or even any clearly defined characters. 
all i have is anger and depression because all i’ve ever done is sit and listen and watch. 
Maybe i should just write until i’m too tired to be angry anymore. 
I know the depression isn’t going to go away anytime soon or ever. 
I don’t know what i’m doing with my life any more. 
And it’s getting harder to be happy that i keep waking up. 
Its getting harder to stand in front of the medicine cabinet and not take inventory of what’s there that can finally solve my problems. 
in the terminal sense. 
not that’ll ever do anything about anything ever except maybe get up enough gumption to write about it. 
i’ve always been too much of a pussy to kill myself. 
either way, i’m just pissed off and disgusted with the world around me. 
i have been for a good long time. 
existence makes me sick. 
and i’m having a hard time finding the point of anything anymore.
-----
He noticed the van when he woke up in the afternoon. 
it was a big one. 
black and hulking and shiney. 
way too new and clean looking to belong in the neighborhood. 
everything about it was off. 
it gave him what they used to call “the willies”. 
I don’t know what they call it these days, but it’s probably some lyrics in a bad rap song that just repeats until you get some contrived phrase stuck in your head with a metronomic beat in the background to hypnotise you.
He walked back in from the balcony, trying to keep his willies in check. 
He flicked the coffee pot back to life and poured his first cup when it was still cold.
That morning slash last night had been educational, to say the least. 
He had under his control, not only the community college in Ohio, but the state university that was connected to it. 
From the university he was able to get access to several research companies that were contracting free labour from the students. 
There was a long list of damages he could pull off. 
He could very easily bring the whole thing down, but what would be the fun in that? He had access to CEO email accounts, he had the board of directors for the higher education on a string. 
And none of them were the wiser. 
At least for our hero, he’s mostly just curious. 
The only time he uses his powers for what could be called evil, were some skirmishes he had with some kids on a forum when he was much younger. 
He didn’t do anything really bad. 
Blacklisting their accounts not only on the forums, but with the phone company and the ISP. 
He just wanted them to know that he didn’t appreciate what those kids were up to. 
and he had the power to make it stop. 
All it took was a long night at the keyboard. 
Even as a kid, he was proud of himself for knocking those kids offline, but part of him didn’t sleep well. 
Part of him knew that he was playing with fire. 
And as they say, eventually, you’re going to get burned.
The van hadn’t moved all day. 
He kept tabs on it from the balcony while he would smoke. 
nothing moved, for hours. 
no one went in or out. 
The van was big enough to house two grown men standing upright. 
with enough room for them to park a small car in there. 
Something about it made him nervous. 
His anxiety was usually in check when he was at home, but this foreign element in his neighborhood wasn’t sitting well.
The threw some food in the microwave. 
he didn’t really look at it. 
it was just fuel.
He closed the blinds and turned all the lights off. 
The microwave beeped and he jumped a little bit. 
His nerves were slipping. 
Maybe it’s nothing he tells himself. 
Maybe it’s nothing to worry about, but being a little paranoid wouldn’t hurt. 
He had been engaging in his little hobby at the apartment for a few years now. 
Rent control allowed him not to care about his job. 
He wasn’t one of those people that wanted to move up the later. 
He paid his rent and bills on time. 
Had enough leftover to feed himself and have a pot of coffee. 
Everything else went into his machines. 
The idea of real human interaction beyond what he needed to do at work never really interested him.
When he was a kid, he spent most of his time in the library. 
He liked that library. 
It was quiet and full of books. 
He could read and write and draw dinosaurs. 
His mother would leave him there while she went to work. 
He would wait their after school for her to pick him up. 
The librarians didn’t approve of the practice of parents using the library like a day care. 
But the kid behaved very well. 
He kept to himself. 
never racked up library fines.
When the library got its first computer, he was hooked. 
He learned everything about it. 
When the library computer got wired into the local network, he figured out how to access everything. 
He learned to write simple programs, administer the whole network. 
This was back in the day that when no one except the techs could tell what he was up to. 
The city worker that was responsible for taking care of the network couldn’t figure out where all these changes were coming from. 
After all, he set up the system so that only he should know how to do anything except look up books. 
Security through obscurity never works. 
It does keep anyone out that doesn’t have any creative know how or sense of curiosity. 
But when you’re a kid with a lot of free time and a sense of exploration, it only takes time. 
It took him a week to figure out how the catalog worked. 
It took him another week to figure out how the database of the whole county library users worked. 
he could add and delete fines, he had everyone’s address and phone number. 
He started installing simple games in sub directories, far from prying eyes of anyone that didn’t have access to the logs.
Everything was going fine. 
He grew up at the library and eventually, he got a job there in his formative teenage years. 
He was re-coding a bit of the backend search function and felt someone over his shoulder.
He alt-tabbed out of his program and back to the usual white text on black background of the library system. 
He could dial in from home and work on it later. 
This was back in those days, when you could call up other modems on the phone lines. 
it was easier and a bit more laborious in those days. 
Getting access usually meant knowing little more than what numbers to dial. 
knowing how to navigate a VAX/VMS system.
-------
Heavy breathing, running, turn the corner, duck into the alley, try to catch your breath. 
Their backpacks got heavier with every block. 
They took a risk.
He hadn’t taken his hobby to the physical realm. 
He was pushed there. 
He was way out of his comfort zone. 
All because he was a little careless at work.
“That rent-a-cop is probably going to phone it in, we should lay low for the night.” his companion was like him. 
He’d never met anyone like him. 
And that’s how bonds are formed. 
and that’s how trust systems begin. 
Everyone is hard wired to trust themselves. 
When you meet someone that reminds you of yourself, you want to believe them. 
Why would you lie to you?
“I know..*inhale* a place *exhale*... 
just a few more blocks… you ready?”
They take off running, trying to get ahead of where ever the real cops might be coming from. 
Dressing in all black is good when you’re not seen, but you tend to stand out when someone is looking for you. 
This wasn’t the food court at the mall. 
This was downtown on a tuesday night.
They stuck to the back alleys as much as possible, winding a path, zig zagging a trail like someone was trying to shoot at them from behind. 
For all they knew, that wasn’t an impossible scenario. 
The neon glow of a chinese restaurant called them home. 
They slipped in the back trying to get out of the way of several giant boiling pots of soup. 
The cooks didn’t care. 
Most of them were drunk on rice wine and waiting for a moment to squat in the ally for a cigarette.
They pushed through a backdoor. 
and there a kid in his twenties, tattoos on his arm, short hair buzz cut from a few weeks back. 
Table lined with highly caffeinated soda cans, most of them crumpled, ash trays packed with butts, a smell of old laundry and pig parts, cigarette smoke and spills that no one could clean anymore.
“Tran, meet Sawyer, Sawyer say hi to Tran.” Neither of them says hi, but they nod at each other.
“Tran knows more about the phone system then the old guys that repair it. 
He was the first one to build a patch box. 
You guys should get to know each other.”
The guy with the long hair that did a lot of talking takes his backpack off and opens it. 
He pulls stacks of print out and starts laying them out on a table. 
Seeing what that haul produced, if anything.
“Where’d you go tonight, watermark looks familiar.” Tran is helping sift through the pile of perforated edge paper, looking for anything of value.
“we hit the dumpsters behind the post office. 
Then the call center. 
It looks like it’s mostly garbage, but we’ll see.”
“woah woah woah, look at this.” Tran pulls up an inter-office memo. 
There’s a list of private dial-ups. 
That’s a start. 
Tran sets it aside in the save pile.
“Holy shit! fuckin’ jackpot!” The guy with the long hair pulls up a string of five pages still stuck together with post it notes still attached. 
The notes have some low level account information. 
Maintenance logins. 
If the information is still current, these three guys will have the call center’s guts laid out before them. 
And one call center has enough information in it to exploit several hundred other targets. 
The pages go in the keep file.
Sawyer opened his backpack and took out another stack of pages, some of them stuck together, bits of gum, coffee stains, lunch leftovers erasing spots on the cheap printer paper. 
He has the loot from the post office. 
That’s government information in there. 
That’s a felony charge. 
He looks at this stack of paper and wonders how long he could go to jail for raiding the dumpster. 
He tries not to think about it, he wants to look tough in front of his new friends. 
He wants them to think he does this kind of stuff all the time.
Flashback time.-----
He alt-tabbed out of the program he was writing.
“That’s some tight looking code you got there. 
do they know what you’re doing?”
A kid with hair down past his shoulders, a black leather studded jacket, ripped jeans, dirt and ketchup stains. 
Sawyer doesn’t know what to say. 
No one ever knows what he’s doing. 
and he doesn’t bother anyone about what they’re doing.
“Hey man, don’t worry, i won’t tell anyone. 
He brushes his hair back from his thin face. 
he reaches out a hand looking for a shake and an introduction. 
“I’m Cut. 
what’s your name?”
“Sawyer,” he says apprehensively shaking the grunge punk’s hand.
“That your birth name?” cut shakes his hand and laughs. 
“They call me Cut, but i post as Ctrl-X. 
What do you post as? maybe i’ve seen your work before.” Cut is sitting in a chair that’s backwards because he saw the character John Bender do it in The Breakfast Club. 
he figured that’s how a bad ass sits.
“I don’t post anywhere,” Sawyer says. 
He knows what Cut is talking about, kind of. 
He works too much to think about sharing or interacting with other people. 
Until earlier that year, he thought he was pretty much isolated. 
He didn’t know that he was part of a small group of kids that caught the bug same as him. 
They saw this new tech and fell into it, hard.
“Well, shit, ain’t that a shame. 
It’s no time to be going solo. 
There’s a big world out there, just waiting for people like us.” People like us, Sawyer thought. 
How many of ‘us’ are there? he didn’t say a thing.
“Look, i know that talking must not be your thing. 
you’re an action guy, right? you need a keyboard and a problem to fix. 
You need a puzzle, yeah? that’s cool, i get it. 
Hey look, you wanna see something cool?” How many times has this happened? You wanna see something cool has started so many relationships, lead so many kids down a rabbit hole. 
Who doesn’t want to see something cool. 
We as a species are curious by nature, cautious by exposure.
Cut slides his chair in front of the computer. 
He alts in to the console and within a few minutes, the library computer is talking to the local university. 
He’s logged in on a backdoor account he made the day before.
“Check this out,” he says, typing furious and sloppy. 
Hitting more keys then he should in his excitement to show off.
The screen pulls up the university mail server and lists the mailbox for every department, every professor, and the privileged few students that were allowed access.
“Woah…” Sawyer’s eyes went wide.
“Yeah, cool stuff, right? This is some heavy metal here. 
They’re running UNIX on a small Beowulf cluster. 
I just found this address yesterday.” He types a few more commands and he’s pulled up software they’re working on in a partnership with an aeronautics company out in California.
“I’m not totally sure what they’re working on, but it’s some high level shit. 
I think it’s got something to do with satellites, or something.” Sawyer looked at the code and tried to follow. 
Even with his obsessive nature, his constant study, this was way over his head. 
The math was something he had never seen before.
“Pretty fuckin’ cool, yeah? I don’t know what it does, but i bet there’s a bunch of people that want to keep it a secret.” A stranger walks into the room and Cut closes out and gets the screen back to the libraries search catalog. 
“This place is getting too crowded for me, you smoke?”
Sawyer didn’t smoke, but he was impressed and intimidated and had never met anyone like Cut before.
“yeah, sure.” They went outside. 
Then they started hanging out. 
And then things would escalate.
----
An alert popped up on the screen indicating a new Email. 
In a very dangerous town in Romania, the message is opened and a contract is negotiated. 
A target is established. 
A payment system is set up and a deadline is argued upon. 
The price is very high. 
The work is dangerous enough that one wrong move will bring in the international authorities. 
No one wants that. 
But in the event that the job is compromised, everyone will disavow all knowledge. 
A fire will wipe out as much evidence as the preliminary data wipe might leave behind. 
Everything is conducted over the dark web. 
-- quick aside about the dark web since people like to throw that term around a lot lately. 
The dark web at the top layer, refers to the spidered, uncataloged addresses of the internet. 
A level deeper are networks like Tor, and I2P. 
Networks that operate much the same as the internet we all know and love, but with the except that if you don’t know about it, you can’t get there. 
It will never show up on a search engine. 
You can’t even see it unless you know how to route your internet connection through the right channels. 
In essence, the dark web is a vast, virtual private network. 
If you don’t know how to look for it, you’ll never be able to find it. 
--
By using encrypted channels, aliases, globe trotting routes, it’s virtually impossible to get traced back to the real world. 
Unless you do something stupid, like check your personal clearnet email. 
Log onto your bank account. 
Associate anything you do on the dark web with your real life self. 
All it takes is one fuck up. 
One fuck up and someone watching what you’re doing. 
And best believe that in the world of high tech law enforcement, they can see anything you do if you don’t take the right precautions.
The contract was a pretty simple plan with some high stakes risks. 
There’s a senator in the US, trying to get a bill passed. 
Take him out. 
When they talk about taking someone out in a digital age, we’re not talking about killing them. 
Messy, too easy. 
We’re talking about ruining someone’s life. 
Discrediting. 
Drag him through the mud. 
Make him look like an animal. 
Or better yet, expose him for the filth he is. 
It’s not the most difficult thing to do with politicians. 
They all have some skeletons in the closet. 
Something they don’t want the public to see. 
And most of them aren’t the tech savvy types they want us to believe. 
We suffer from thinking the people we elect are smart enough to do their jobs, and more than that. 
We like to think in a post watergate world, in a post scandal after scandal world, that these people might learn something. 
And we’re constantly proven wrong.
The job was a no brainer for the den in Romania. 
These guys were vets. 
They’d been doing this since they were kids and the Wall was still up. 
The money, held in escrow, in encryption until proof of the job’s completion, was enough to upgrade everyone’s rig in the den. 
Enough to get a new heater installed for the coming winter. 
And enough for a night of celebration with bottle service at their favorite all night club. 
Enough for them all to buy some companions for the night.
He agrees and begins phase one: research.
----
The boardroom doors close and most of the people present have a trajectory lined out.
“Smyth, a minute of your time, please.”
“Sure, sir, what’s up?” She’s one of five women at the company and knows that she’s been outnumbered in this room and in most rooms she’s ever been in.
“I want to make sure you know that you’re appreciated. 
Right? you know that? you know i’d never single you out, yeah? I just want to let you know, at these meetings, it’s a matter of credibility, yeah? it’s just we’re all taking time out of our days to try and get everyone on the same page. 
You know what i mean, right? do you see where i’m going with this? No one wants to have the air filled with the obvious. 
No one wants to hear anything that we can put out in the email later on. 
It’s just that we don’t have time for repetition. 
These guys that come from the fifth floor. 
they’re busy people. 
They don’t want to hear things they don’t understand. 
They don’t have time for that. 
They just want results. 
Just the facts and all that. 
So if you could. 
Just stick to the script, yeah? Just try to keep it, what do they say? on the down low. 
I’d rather you kept more notes. 
Just be a face they can look at when they’re bored? alright? not a problem, right. 
ok good. 
Good talk.”
Sophia walked out of the board room and tried not to let her anger get the best of her. 
She tried not to let everyone she saw know that everything she’d ever worked for was turning into a problem because as they never let her forget, she was a woman, she had a vagina, and that was a problem. 
It wasn’t a problem for her, really, it was a problem for them. 
The boys had a hard time working when she was around. 
They often didn’t type as fast. 
They looked up too much. 
or looked down too much when she was around. 
It was a problem. 
She was a problem. 
She tried and was ambitious. 
She made a noise. 
and when you make a noise, you became a problem at the old boys club. 
I’m not talking about the political one. 
I’m talking about the tech club. 
The old boys that have been at this since the beginning. 
The ones with beards and last week’s shirt. 
The ones that never take her seriously. 
Never treat her like she’s a boss, or sorts. 
At least it says so on her business card. 
And they’ve never worried about business cards. 
They don’t have to. 
Their names are all over the community. 
They’re found more 0 Day bugs then the rest of the world combined. 
That was how this company got where it did. 
It cherry picked the best of the best. 
and when it couldn’t get them to come over, they just bought the company they were working for. 
it didn’t matter. 
They wanted a best of. 
They wanted a greatest hits album. 
They expected Sophia to be able to wrangle them, and simultaneously keep quiet. 
a low profile. 
She had to be an authority figure that didn’t get in their way. 
She never knew how that was ever suppose to work. 
she did know this company. 
She did know the importance of the job. 
She did know that she could freeze a cold war before the general public got wind of it. 
And that was the unspoken elephant in the room that kept her there. 
The higher ups knew she could handle the negotiations. 
They knew she could take being held hostage with a gun to her head and not give anyone a word. 
They knew she was thick skinned and tough like a wall. 
But respect? Treat her like an equal? She was a woman for christ’s sake. 
What did she really know about computers.
A goddamn hell of a lot.
Her father worked at Lawrence Livermoore during the first space race. 
She was private schooled and schooled further at home. 
Her life was high level machine code. 
She breathed it. 
She remembered when her father came home for months, distraught because one of the system admins had noticed there were traces of foreigners in the system. 
Later she learned they were spies from East Germany. 
A group of kids. 
They had managed to break into the labs computers from behind the iron curtain. 
She saw her father going through the stress of being attacked by an unknown enemy. 
An enemy they learned later hardly knew what they were doing. 
A bunch of kids on amphetamines and cocaine, working for the mob. 
Degenerates. 
She was twelve years old and she never forgot it. 
She vowed then and there that she didn’t want to see this kind of thing go any further.
And now here she was. 
Wrangler to a bunch of the same. 
The same kind of kids, now grown up, employed to keep the new kids from doing what they did as kids. 
Information Security is a strange business. 
Sometimes a kid will hack through. 
Will get past everything and beat the end boss. 
Some of them did see it as a video game. 
The metaphor is apt. 
They’d get to the end and think they’d win a job. 
Instead most of them ended up in jail. 
The old computer fraud and abuse act took care of that. 
A catch all law from the early days that let lawyers throw anyone in jail even for an accident. 
For assumed company loss. 
When Robert Morris crashed several hundred computers on accident before he was a teenager, because he was smarter then the people that wrote the code he accidentally exploited, he created a generation of fear. 
Kids are too smart. 
And they’re going to bring down the whole thing. 
The power grid, the water systems, traffic lights. 
you name it. 
Some kid behind a computer. 
the worst enemy. 
He scared the shit out of everyone that heard the news. 
If he can bring down the whole scientific community with one program, what’s going to happen when the russians figure this out? They have whole teams dedicated to it. 
and an 22 year old managed to do from his dorm room. 
That was the real turning point during the first cold war. 
When the top brass realized that no matter how many nukes they had stock piled, everything could be taken out by a kid with a keyboard. 
The older military didn’t get it. 
The older politicians didn't get it. 
But NASA did. 
The Aerospace labs did. 
The geeks all over the country understood right from the bat. 
And Sophia’s father was right in the thick of it. 
And she watched it kill him. 
She saw him get a little more tired every day. 
The whole concept was so hopeless. 
It crushed him. 
She’d be damned if it crushed her too. 
And so her days went. 
Looking at these geeks, separated by sudo partitions. 
Thinking they were the hottest shit on the scene. 
She knew what a kid could do. 
That they could see right between their legs. 
A kid could hit them were it counted. 
There was a part of her that wanted to see their faces when that happened. 
There was another part of her that never wanted to see that happen ever again.
-----
This story is a mess. 
I admited that from the beginnging. 
I don’t know where i’m going with it. 
there’s no ending in sight. 
but i wanted to write a cyberpunk thriller. 
so far that hasn’t been accomplished at all. 
The tech details are boring as hell. 
they always will be. 
you can’t really convey the excitment of someone having as many scans in terminals open on a screen. 
Waiting that one of them will scrolled down with a little mark that means we’ve found a vulnerability. 
it’s boring as hell to anyone that doesn’t get it. 
and granted, the people that get are probably too busy doing it to ever read this kind of thing. 
It’s like script kiddie fan fiction anyway. 
but who cares. 
it’s nano. 
and i’m not going to stress about it. 
the whole point of playing this year was to get in the habit of typing, of settting time aside to write something. 
if i want to chunk out sci-fi shit set in current time when most of it isn’t fiction, but science fact, that’s my problem. 
you want to write a tech thriller based on the giant mess that is Anonymous? be my fucking guest. 
I’m sure it will make the movies someday. 
And everyone involved will get hacked because of it. 
Production by Michael Bay. 
I’m sure everyone in Hollywood is stroking their dicks wanting to make that movie and at the same time too scared too. 
Anon has too much power because we all believe they have too much power. 
Not far from the police forces of the world that they engage in these little tet a tets with. 
And if Hollywood gets majorly hacked. 
Like crippled hacked. 
well, that’d really get some new laws put in, some military police. 
more raids, more vans outside people’s houses. 
More TPP style international aggreements. 
Every action of protest, every dissent, has a reprocussion in more guns for cops. 
more laws to send the loud people to jail. 
I don’t know why i started writing this. 
It has my curiousity. 
It always has. 
Part of me wishes i had the time and energy to stick with it though the years, i’d be making a lot more money to sit on my ass. 
i know that much. 
instead i went off and cooked for ten years, took everything for granted, had a bunch of drug trips, got fucked up on shit booze for ten years, broke as many friendships as i made and now here i am, with a broken foot, afraid to leave the house most of the time, more afraid to actually talk to people. 
I don’t even talk to people on the internet anymore. 
Aside from less than five of the people i know. 
The less than five of the people i would actually call friends despite the number I have attached to me via social media. 
Funny that. 
how that all works and how we all know it. 
oh, i have 30-50 likes out of the 500 people that claim to be friends via social media. 
sometimes it’s only 5 likes. 
why do i bother sharing anything. 
why does anyone share anything except distraction videos of baby animals being uncoordinated. 
Why do we bother trying to say anything that means anything when we know that the majority of people we grew up with, the people we know are scrolling down the feed every day don’t even care. 
Because we use the feed to distract us. 
We use all the feeds to take us away from the shit and the mundane deary lives we all lead. 
No matter how successful you are. 
No matter all the hiking, biking, yachting, adventuring whatever you’re going on, you’re taking time out of your trip to post a picture or scroll down a feed of your friends and their problems and triumphs and success. 
and the whole experience is just cheapened. 
The whole thing is just another spectacle. 
it’s like channel surfing at three in the morning. 
We send each other emoji. 
we send smiley faces that frown because we don’t know how to express sadness anymore. 
We give each other thumbs ups. 
likes. 
upvotes. 
Because we want to acknowledge each other’s success’s. 
we want to be able to say, good job on getting that job and having that kid and getting married even though i couldn’t be there for any of it. 
Good on you and your life. 
Sorry i missed the whole thing. 
here’s a sticker. 
Please remember me when you’re famous.
I don’t mean to bring you down about this. 
I mean, kind of. 
It is a cheapening of the human experience. 
It is the downfall of humanity. 
Anyone scared of robots taking over the human race? they’ve got a head start. 
We’re already robots. 
And we’re programmed not to care about it. 
And until it crashes down our front doors or turns off our power or cuts the switch for our connection, we’re not going to care about it. 
we’re going to keep on posting and fishing for compliments. 
we’re going to keep on scrolling past our friends with cancer, looking for a dollar from each of you that will help them with the bill. 
We’ve already become desensitized to the guy on the corner just trying to get a sandwich. 
Doing the same thing on facebook, despite your disease doesn’t make a lick of difference.
We’re a sick people. 
The more i pay attention to it, the more obvious it gets. 
We deserve to get nuked. 
we took the limitless human potential and what did we do with it? We made sitcoms. 
We made the NFL. 
we made the glorious two party three branched system of super democracy that’s not really anything to do with the actual people that have to live here. 
We are the great human experiment. 
And we’re failing. 
Everyday we fail even more. 
For every moon landing, every Martin Luther King Jr, every cure, we have thousands of new lies, new Hitlers, new diseases. 
We’re fighting a losing battle. 
We’re fighting ourselves. 
I don’t know why i wanted to write in the first place. 
Because the more i pay attention, the more hopeless everything becomes. 
The more i understand the get doped up and tune out ethos of Leary. 
I know that wasn’t his mission, but that’s what he achieved. 
Comfortably Numb. 
That’s what booze and sex and drugs and violence had achieved. 
That’s what politics and television and even the great books, the hundreds of venerable authors ever really did. 
Create bookworms. 
A bunch of smug fucks. 
They do nothing and think they know everything. 
We the people. 
if only there was a god to help us all. 
because goddamn, could we use a god right about now.

“Mr. 
President?”
A man in a suit in the Oval Office is laying down on the most exculsive carpet in the world. 
He’s been passed out for a few hours. 
The wrikles on his suit have formed creases crossing the threads. 
He hasn’t shaved since his last television appearance.
“Mr. 
President?!” A man is standing half way in the door. 
He’s looking for the president.
If i don’t move, maybe he’ll look somewhere else, thought Mr. 
President. 
Maybe he’ll leave me alone today. 
He lies very still, trying to regulate his breathing and play dead.
The man at the door pokes around as much as he can without fully entering the room. 
He’s not allowed to go all the way in unless he’s invited. 
Mr. 
President knows he can’t be seen as long as he doesn’t move from behind his spot under the desk.
“Goddamnit.” The man leaves and closes the door.
“Thank god,” is what Mr. 
President would say. 
He knows the office is bugged. 
Today he just wants to lie on the ground and not talk to anyone. 
Getting time to yourself is important. 
As The Most Powerful Man in The World, it’s really hard for him to get a break. 
And that was today. 
Break day. 
Everyone can take a hike. 
Mr President opens a drawer in the desk and takes out some painkillers and a flask of brandy. 
Not today, he thinks. 
Not after this terrible, long week.
It started with the meetings. 
His week always started with the meetings. 
He hated every minute of them. 
He had to listen to all of them talk, and talk. 
And they just never shut up. 
He had advisors for this reason. 
He had a cabinet. 
They were supposed to handle all of the gritty stuff. 
They were supposed to just tell him where to sign, what to sign, write his speeches, tell him where to go and what to do. 
He just had to put on his suit, pin his American Flag on the jacket, and smile. 
He was sick of it. 
It made him feel like bombing something. 
He didn’t even care. 
If he could turn on the news and watch a town somewhere burning, citizens running in a panic. 
And the screaming. 
The beautiful screaming. 
He would smile that famous Time Magazine cover smile. 
He would sleep soundly at night.
He tips the flask and there’s not much left. 
He eats a few pills, chewing them. 
He washes it down with a hundred and fifty year old brandy. 
Mr. 
President puts his head back down on the carpet and closes his eyes.
“Mr. 
President we have reports coming in from the Ukraine, and Romania, there’s a lot of data going over the wires, sir.” One of the advisors says. 
Mr. 
President looks straight ahead and nods.
“We have reason to believe that there may be some rogue ex-KGB that have organized a small army, all of them with proficient cyber crime histories and backgrounds in espionage.”
The president turns to someone else at the table, looking for a cue.
“Can we send in a team? Don’t we have some special forces that can just go in there and bring these bastards in? or just kill them? Can’t we just kill them?” The military advisor shines one of his medals with the sleeve of his shirt. 
The president liked him. 
He always wanted to take action.
“We can’t just waltz in and kill whoever we want outside of the country.” A woman in a smart conservative suit says. 
“We can’t afford another Iraq, or another Cuba, or shall i go on?” She doesn’t. 
Most of the people shift uncomfortably as soon as she starts talking. 
She sits on the council for foreign affairs, she’s worked with the U.N. 
She’s a huge buzzkill to most of these meetings. 
“We have to find another way to solve this before it gets out of hand. 
I don’t want this government to be seen as incompetent as that cheating website that got taken down.” More uncomfortable shifting. 
Mr. 
President is trying not to roll his eyes. 
The drug cocktail he took earlier is starting to wear off. 
He’ll talk with his military friend over scotch and cigars later. 
Away from little miss world peace and the rest of these mouth breathers. 
Maybe play some golf with the heads of the NSA and CIA tomorrow. 
Sort this business out like they used to.
“Do we know what they’re targeting?” Mr. 
President asks. 
“and do we have a solid lock on their location?”
“They’re seem to be coming in from all over the place. 
Everytime we try to pinpoint anything they disappear and the signal starts coming from somewhere else. 
As for the targets, it’s damn near everything. 
The whole infrastructure of the law enforcement branch of country. 
We haven’t detected any breaks yet, but it’s only a matter of time before something breaks. 
They must have hundreds of people working on this operation.”
“Alright, set up a meeting with The Nerds. 
This meeting is wasting my time. 
I’m a very busy man.” Some nervous fidgeting all around the table. 
When the president wanted to talk to The Nerds that meant the spooks that watch over everything. 
Top brass from the CIA, FBI, NSA, and a handful of smaller operations that were deemed very, very, classified even to most of the people in this room.
Mr. 
President gets up from the table and everyone else stands up while he buttons his jacket and starts to walk out of the room.
He’s snoring lightly and the carpets fabric is making a soft inlay on his face. 
He dreams of bombs dropping everywhere. 
He dreams of a world on fire.
------
rying to focus on the writing, but it seems i’ve come down with a sickness in the face. 
not the best time. 
so it’s sad piano music and coconut water and hoping i don’t swallow too much muscas and sick up all over the place. 
it’s also much colder today and we got some rain. 
that was nice. 
But i’ve been in bed the whole time, so what of it. 
Could barely write yesterday but today i’m making a late start, but a start nonetheless. 
I don’t know about plot or anything tho. 
We have… let's see…
Sawyer and Cut and Tran, We have the nameless, faceless Romanians and Ukrainians, The US government. 
The citizens. 
And i’m doing all this from memory because i don’t want to read anything back yet. 
I’ll just get stuck and suckered into trying to edit. 
and WE can’t go there yet. 
not for 21 more days. 
Let’s hope i can get something done. 
And i don’t know where to take this, really. 
Everyone has to get in trouble. 
that has to be next. 
i can’t put that off any longer. 
We should finish the flashback first. 
that’ll set up the next few dominos. 
let’s go there.
-------------
In a room in the back of a chinese restarraunt, three kids are drinking highly caffinated sodas from the can and huddled around a screen. 
Cut is at the keyboard and he works manically, in fits and bursts of inspiration. 
An unlit cigarette dangling out of his mouth. 
He stops to brush his hair out of the way every few minutes. 
His fingers, tinted with tabacco on the tips, clacking madly at the dirty keyboard. 
It’s the late 1990s.
“They won’t even see this one coming.” he grins and lights the cigarette. 
“Tag, you’re in.” he swivels his chair out of the way and Sawyer cracks his knuckles. 
They were getting deep into a subsystem that was linked to the post office mainframe. 
Most of what they found was garbage. 
Notes, meetings, nothing worth while. 
Sawyer prods his way around the directories, looking for privilege escalation. 
The heap of papers they dug up allowed them to recover a long forgotten maintenance account. 
The access level was enough to get around the post office system, and just enough to leapfrog to whatever they were in now. 
He finds a list of employees and saves it to their local disk. 
That could come in handy later. 
Tran swivels his chair around, looking up from the bit of phone equipment he was rewiring. 
He was the oldest one there, and the quietest. 
Every good group needs a phone and hardware guy and that was Tran. 
Sawyer could handle the software end of things and Cut, he was a smooth talking drink of of long haired, tech saavy charisma. 
He could talk anyone out of all the information he wanted. 
He knew all the jargon, but most of all he knew a few magicians tricks, a little sleight of hand, a little misdirection. 
He could walk into an office build with nothing but a collared shirt and an old tie. 
A few hours later he would have the dial up numbers, the login credentials and sometimes a date with one of the secretaries. 
They were in those days, a power trio of geeks. 
A small group of twenty-somethings that had access to information most people went about their daily lives blissfully ignorant of.
Sawyer enters a command and the screen fills up with text. 
A small flood of output. 
Then it stops and the cursor changes. 
He types two letters and hits return again.
# id
(0) root
“Hey guys…”
Tran looks up and Cut wheels over. 
“Holy shit, dude… you did it.”
They stare at the screen for a few minutes. 
looking at that all significant, all powerfull 0. 
They had complete control of the system, whatever it was. 
The next task at hand was to create a backdoor account with the same level of access. 
Then cover their tracks.
Sawyer takes a smoke break now. 
The hardest part is over. 
Cut takes the wheel, he wants to see what this machine can do. 
He goes through the superuser files, grabs the encrypted account files, the list of connected hosts, and sees something he hasn’t seen before. 
He pokes around more. 
Source code, most of it very complex, heavy math.
“Found some things you might want to take a look at later,” he turns to Sawyer. 
Sawyer is just smiling still, and putting out the end of his cigarette. 
“Yeah, I think i need a minute, maybe some air. 
You guys need anything from the corner store?”
“Yeah, get me some licorice. 
And another six pack of soda.”
“Hey Tran, you need anything from the shop?” He shakes his head and goes back to his soldering iron.
Sawyer puts his jacket on and steps out of the restaurant into the crisp evening air. 
He’s got the after glow he’s been feeling a lot lately, since hanging out at the restaurant with Cut and Tran. 
The feeling of accomplishment after making a big break. 
Being in that back room with all the smoke and soda, Cut’s taste in Scandinavian metal music, the smells of the restaurant wafting in, it was starting to feel normal. 
He was starting to feel at home and accepted for the first time.
Sawyer walked out of the corner store with a plastic bag with the sodas and snacks and cigarettes. 
He wanted to spend just a little more time in the fresh air before heading back to the cave. 
The cool air felt good on his face. 
He reached into his pocket and took out a smoke. 
He looked up after he lit it, that’s when he noticed the van. 
Had that been there before? He couldn’t remember. 
There were plenty of white vans around town. 
It was probably just a repairman.
Inside the restaurant, on both stories of the building, the power goes out. 
“Aw fuck!” Cut says, “I hope we got everything saved. 
Tran looks out of a small window near the ceiling to see what’s going on. 
The door to the room is kicked down and within seconds the room is flooded with armed and armored cops.
“Go go go!”
“Oh what the fuck!” Cut is yelling and scrambling but there’s nowhere to go. 
Tran doesn’t move. 
He’s probably going to get beaten for resisting arrest either way. 
But he won’t make it worse. 
He grew up hearing stories of what the cops would do to the other Asians in town. 
If he sat still and complied, at least they couldn’t justify shooting him. 
A cop tackles him to the ground and punches him across his face. 
He has his wrists in cuffs and an elbow in his back. 
Cut is kicking and screaming and trying to get free. 
The two cops push him on the ground and he gets the same treatment. 
A punch in the face to let him know who’s in charge here. 
And the cuffs, to keep him from using his hands.
Sawyer sees the lights are out from across the street and he gets a twitch of that animal instinct. 
The one that tells him he’d better watch his back, that maybe he should run. 
he stays on his side of the street.
The cops shine lights over the room.
“Oh shit, it’s just a couple of kids.”
“A couple of kids that are in some really deep shit.” one of the cops leafs through the papers on the table, sees all the technical equipment laying around, understands none of it except his orders.
“Load them up, then we’ll clean up this mess.”
“You fucking pigs! you can’t do this! I have rights!”
“You ain’t got shit now, kid. 
Get them out of here. 
I want to get this over with.”
The cops haul Tran and Cut out of the restaurant. 
Most of the cooks have taken off running, afraid they might get tapped for expired visas. 
The restaurant patrons have also left. 
This was not a good day for business. 
The owner took off running as soon as they didn’t come for him first. 
His english wasn’t the best and he didn’t know how to explain the situation anyway. 
He also knew what cops did to Asians in this town. 
what the cops did to anyone that didn’t speak English so well.
Sawyer sees the cops hauling his friends through the front of the restaurant and books it around the corner. 
His mind is a blur of oh shit oh shit oh shit. 
He wants to run all the way to his mom’s house, he also needs to watch the rest of this go down. 
He peeks around the corner and sees Cut kicking and yelling injustice at the cops, three squad cars pull up and Tran goes in the back of one and Cut in the other. 
Two detectives walk into the building and go right for the back door.
I’m fucked. 
i’m so fucked right now. 
they’re going to dust the place for prints or find something with my name on it. 
Shit shit shit. 
i’m going to jail.
He was barely eighteen. 
he was too young for this. 
He couldn’t go to his mom’s house. 
that’s the first place they’re going to look. 
The library was closed. 
he still had the keys. 
He figure that was a good place to lay low. 
At least he could sleep there as long as he left before the opening librarian got there. 
There was another voice in his head. 
The one that told him to go back. 
Goddamnit.
There was a spot where he could see all the cops and their vehicles in front of the restaurant. 
He was pretty sure no one could see him. 
He decided to watch and wait. 
He opened a soda and lit another cigarette. 
An hour went by and he watched as they took all of Tran’s equipment, the computer they worked on. 
The stacks of printouts that they’d stolen over the last year. 
They grabbed everything that looked technical. 
It was all evidence. 
Sawyer had never been as stressed out as he was right now. 
His friends were in their separate cars were the first to go. 
They were probably taken down town to get filed and placed into hold until someone gave an order to move them wherever they’d have to go. 
From where he was looking, none of them stood a chance. 
Federal property, breaking and entering, petty theft. 
It wasn’t a pretty rap sheet. 
It was enough to send all three of them away for a while. 
At very least they were looking at ten years. 
He didn’t know anything about law enforcement or how it worked beyond cop shows and what was in the newspapers. 
but that’s most people.
He waited paticiantly and anxiously for them to leave the site. 
A pile of butts at his feet and a few empty, crushed cans sitting next to him. 
The sky was well dark by the time he felt it was safe to go back.
The restaurant was empty, plates of half eaten noodles and dumplings still on some of the tables. 
The phone was ringing. 
At least the lights were back on. 
Sorry about that neighbors, sorry the cops had to pull the plug on your power while they raided the place. 
Sawyer was still making an effort to be quiet, thinking someone was going to jump out at him. 
It was like walking into a crime scene. 
He was walking into a crime scene. 
Shit. 
He turned the lights on and looked around. 
The place was gutted. 
clean spots out of place outlined where their set up once was. 
He checked for his backpack and couldn’t find it. 
He looked around for anything, maybe a floppy disk that someone didn’t see. 
Nothing. 
They even took the trash. 
a tangle of wires that went up to the roof was dangling in the small window by the ceiling is all that remained of Tran’s phone line handiwork.
Sawyer took another look around the room and decided it was a good time to get out of town. 
He had a little money in the bank saved up. 
It was enough for a bus ride. 
He thought it would be best to drain the whole account and go on cash from now on. 
Make his way west. 
That’s where all the money was anyway. 
This town was dead to him. 
He’d send a postcard to mom, and he hoped his mom wasn’t going to get harassed by the cops. 
It was time to go.
-----
Can’t seem to focus today. 
Every time i start writing something takes me away again. 
Can’t seem to find the rhythm. 
Caffeine? nicotine? booze? i don’t know. 
i have all of those things. 
But my eyes are having a time adjusting, my fingers keep stopping. 
I’m getting too caught up in thinking about the act of writing instead of committing. 
Let it happen organically. 
let it barf right out of the fingertips. 
just like old times. 
except it will never be like the old times. 
the good old days are the good old days because they’re behind us. 
Nostalgia never lies. 
I miss the old apartment, the ballroom. 
There was no other choice. 
We couldn’t afford to do anything else most of the time. 
so we had to write or play music. 
that kind of forced creativity was good for that time of my life. 
Now i’m older and with that comes a shit storm of responsibilities and distractions and other people that i have to think about and worry about and that's life. 
life is all these distractions. 
How many Kubla Khan’s have been ruined by neighbors or friends or parents or spouses.
That’s ok for now. 
I’ve got some Melissa Manchester on the radio. 
a little don’t cry out loud. 
another one of those good old days songs. 
Even though that was what? three years ago. 
it doesn’t even feel like it. 
four maybe? either way, another place, another time. 
another world almost. 
just across the bay. 
snacks are also the devil of distraction
stop eating those chips, loser. 
you have a story to tell.
--------
The bus was pulling into Reno when Sawyer woke up. 
He managed to get a new backpack somewhere along the way, a change of clothes. 
He still didn’t have much, and he was going to keep it that way for a while. 
He was racing the winter weater to the coast. 
He could feel it in the wind right at his heels. 
He whispered his name and it sent a chill down his spine. 
When he slept on the bus his dreams were full of seeing cops charging at him. 
of seeing his friends being tortured in some basement. 
He dreampt of screens wearing badges growing teeth and swallowing him. 
He would wake up in sweats cold and hot the smell of other travelers acosting his senses on all sides. 
The gruff lump of coat and beard he was trying to press himself against the window to avoid seemed to grow wider with every breath.
-------
Ding ding ding 16K fire up the waffles and the luftwaffe and luft balloons and build me up buttercup and let's take this down to dixie and ride like the wind and who cares anymore. 
time for a free write, how you like them apples, you asshole you don’t do you and i don’t care because the radio will sing me to sleep and drown out the snores and the bores and the blah blha blah and what are you going to do about it anyway and here i stand and here i go. 
and oh shit i stopped to adjust and now i’m trying to recover and will he make it folks...
i doubt it. 
i doubt this and i doubt you too. 
I’m johnny fuckin’ appleseed and i’m sowing the seeds of doubt in your cornfields. 
deal with it. 
i’m H H Holmes and i’m going to be up all night in the basement, I’m John Hancock and this is the rubber stamp that i’m going to slap all over your waterlogged watermarks. 
I’m the president of the United States and i’m out of my goddamn mind! I’m johnny carson and heeerrrreeeeesssss johhhhh nyy! I’m jack nicholson and you’re not. 
I’m on a roll down the hill in a barrel over niagara falls and gravity falls and i’m falling down a plot hole and you're’ coming with me. 
you haven’t seen the last of me he screamed shrinking and shreeking and sinking into oblivion and how about that folks? didn’t see that coming the masks under the masks and the masquerade will never stop because you don’t have a fuckin’ clue who i really am. 
there is no journey of self discovery. 
just a chance to give up all over again. 
Just another let down and ground beef and the ground is where i’m going, baby. 
take it or leave it alone and jonestown was the best thing that ever happened. 
Mass is like suicide too. 
except you’re slowly killing yourself and looking into the eyes of the priest while he takes his robes around your neck and puts the squeeze on you. 
and your last breath you gasp and say something stupid like room service and the butler and the maid are busy smoking dope on the veranda. 
Keep crying you little shit. 
Keep punching cracks in the mirror that is the shit facade parade of your life. 
see if they care, if anyone will notice.
I don’t care. 
just leave me alone. 
I’m going to use your restroom and i’m taking a copy of the new york times bestseller list and i’m going to give myself a dozen paper cuts shoving the whole thing up my asshole so i can shit it out again, put it in it’s place.
There i go, again on my own, stopping for some dumb reason. 
just to change the song. 
keep the fire going. 
keep the flame alive. 
burn the dream to the ground. 
here, here’s some matches. 
here’s a pile of newspaper. 
He’s some highly flammable people. 
shit i stopped again. 
I wish i had someone to slap my in the back of the head everytime i look up or stop typing because that’s the only way we're going to get through this mess together. 
and you’re with me right. 
right along for the ride of your life. 
Its going to be a wild one and it’s going to be a dumb ride and at the end you’re going to be holding a copy of my screenplay and saying, wow, that didn’t go anywhere. 
What a circlejerk. 
you think you’re such a writer. 
you think you can just will a great story into being. 
the great american novel. 
what a joke that all was. 
what a joke all my dreams ever became. 
how many times do i have to start over, never getting stronger, just getting more wounded, more afraid of other people. 
just shaking and hiding alone and trying to avoid attention and not being able to understand why anyone wants that anyway. 
I don’t get selfies and i don’t get people that take pictures of their breakfast and i don’t get why we care so much. 
When did we start caring about other people's shoes or the loads and heaps of causal reviews from the common people writing about every single thing that has ever been made. 
I have my doubts that in the culture we’ve created that anyone will ever rise to the kind of greatness that we used to have. 
Nowadays our great people are all CEOs or personal brands. 
Celebrity for the sake of celebrity. 
People that don’t create, people that can’t make anything by themselves. 
And we mock and dismantle every effort by the lower people to try and do anything. 
we strike them down before they have a chance. 
Our culture is a foot holding it’s own head under water.
Somewhere in the last ten years, i just turned into this angry person that seems so calm all the time. 
you’re so quiet, you never say anything. 
Why bother. 
I have nothing original to say. 
Like a deflated red balloon. 
like i don’t know. 
like a person that’s mad all the time and pretends that everything is ok all the time even though he hates everything around him and it makes me sick and people make me sick and i can’t listen to them talk about anything without thinking how stupid they are and how stupid the conversation is and why any of them bother with it and how can they listen to this shit all the time and think it’s anything except a fat load of shit. 
How have we not just put bullets in each others brains by now. 
I have no idea. 
I know that i have a hard time participating because what doesn’t make me sick just seems so obvious. 
Like a bunch of mouth breathers talking about how the sky is blue today, it was blue yesterday and the day before that going back as far as ever. 
And they talk about politics and religion and TV shows and books and each other like it’s not the same damn conversation again. 
I don’t know how you can stand it. 
I don’t know how any of you can stand it. 
I’m Myles Standish and we’re charging into battle. 
I’m Frobisher and this is my sinking ship. 
I’m John Lennon and i’m on broadway playing scenes from the new testament. 
Hold your applause until the gunfire has settled down.
I want to stop on an even number of words
--------------
Another day, lets’ give it a short warm up and try to get on with the story. 
The girlfriend and cats are sleeping. 
i’ve drank half a beer and i’m ready i think. 
There’s some blues playing on the radio and maybe that can help me get sawyer off the bus and into the modern era. 
I’m guessing we’ll do the spotty flashback thing to get us back to the present. 
that might work. 
This cold weather is like old times. 
it reminds me of how it was. 
Cold with a few dollars in the back. 
a few warm beers within reach. 
the beer is warmer then i feel and i have blankets to keep me warm. 
ok ok, let’s try to focus on what’s going to happen, He’s on the bus in Reno, something has to happen, some ACTION. 
something EXCITING. 
A THRILL. 
i don’t even know what that means, but maybe we can get somewhere. 
This song started off with the sounds of bottles rattling and a way ward harmonica then the guitar kics in. 
like the good old days. 
That makes me happy. 
try not to let that get in the way of the writing. 
ok let’s go.
--------
The bus pulls into the station. 
The lights of Reno flickering on like a wave spreading over the small strech of downtown. 
Build like a canyon of steel and concrete surrounded by mountains on one side and the flat expanse of dessert on the other. 
little patches of snow visable on the mountains in the distance. 
And California is right over there. 
just over those mountains. 
(oh it’s a jimi hendrix song, neato) And in California there will be oppourtunies. 
There will be money and a chance to start over. 
Take on a new name. 
Forget everything that happened back home. 
He needs that california freshnes, that gold rush calling card siren song to sing him to sleep. 
he wants to feel it in his bones and drink it in the morning. 
It was amazing, he thought, how in a split second you can make up your mind to do something that never occured to you. 
He’d grown up not giving much thought to where he was or what he was going to do. 
He was absorbed in his hobby. 
His job. 
He didn’t look too far ahead. 
He was more interested in how the technology grew. 
How the speed of things seemed to double and double again. 
How everything was pushing to go as fast as possible, to break speed limits, space limits, time limits. 
How much smaller the world had become. 
How much smaller the machines had become. 
As a kid he never dreamed he’d be able to have his own computer, much less one small enough to fit in his backpack. 
But that was all possible now. 
He decided he was going to lay low in Reno and work up the money to get a portable computer, then finish the journey west. 
As of right now, he owned his backpack, a light blanket, the clothes and shoes he wore and a change of clothes to wear so as not to stand out too much as a mess. 
He wanted to get a job. 
And his first stop was the phone booth. 
He opened the phone book and looked up local libraries. 
Tran taught him a little trick with pay phones. 
Something he was forever endebted to him for. 
Back in those days the whole phone system operated on sounds. 
When you put money into the phone, if you listened, you’d hear a series of chirps. 
Turns out if you record that noise and play it into the phone, it can’t tell the difference. 
Tran used to build what he called red boxes. 
He would buy a tone dialer from Radio Shack, a hand held device that would play touch tones in case you still had a rotary. 
With a little bit of wire work, you could program the box to play the sounds of coins being registered by the phone. 
And with that, make all the free calls in the world. 
Sawyer wished he had one of those now. 
But he could get a pocket tape recorder across the street. 
Ten minutes later he was on the phone to the local library asking for work. 
Then a few more calls. 
No work right now. 
He wasn’t too discouraged. 
he just got to town. 
He stopped at a gas station. 
a pack of smokes. 
some caffine. 
some fuel. 
He figured he was in Reno, right? the thing to do there was gamble. 
He had just turned eighteen and could get into the casinos. 
I bet he could get a job there. 
And so he went, one gas station shower later, trying to keep himself as clean looking as possible, he went to the strip.
The whole town seemed to glow. 
And that biggest little city in the world sign was a nice touch. 
He couldn’t help but be fascinated by the show. 
His town wasn’t much to look at and this was something he’d never even imagined. 
And the sounds were just so constant. 
always a noise and music and people hooting and hollering and calling out to people on the street to come on in and see a show, come on it, a winner every minute. 
Come on down to the buffet. 
all you can eat. 
All you can eat lobster and other luxuries. 
All the creatures of the land and sea, spread out before you. 
fourteen dollars. 
All of it yours.
Sawyer figured he’d just keep asking at every place he could until he got a job. 
He met a lot of tough looking types in varying degrees of smart looking suits. 
He shook a lot of hands. 
Saw a lot of show girl legs. 
He was almost at the end of the strip, his feet were sore and he was starting to doubt if anything was going to happen today. 
He walked into a club that wasn’t the nicest place he’d seen that day. 
The paint was a on the old side, the decor was strangely out of place, even for Reno. 
The staff was older, and warmth wasn’t their first impression. 
He did manage to meet with the owner, a short man with light brown skin and black hair that was thinning on top. 
He was sitting behind a desk in the back, The desk was a mess of papers and paper weights and reciepts and casino chips and tokens. 
A plant was dying in the corner next to a poster of an open window with a beach view.
“Look kid, i’m guessing you just got off a bus from bumsfuck Iowa or whatever. 
That’s not my problem. 
I’ve got plenty of problems and i don’t need yours on the pile, you know what i’m sayin? So you seem like a good kid and i’m up to by balls in shit around here. 
I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking, hey this guys got it together, the place is great, everything is in order, but let me tell you something, kid. 
You know anything about computers? I need my books in order. 
I can’t make heads or tails or sideways of shit. 
I’m a busy man, you know? Lots going on. 
Don’t have time for it. 
And my shithead accountant just booked town, you see. 
That fucking weasel ran out on me. 
Worst accountant i’ve ever had. 
anyway, whatever, fuck him. 
He set up this fucking computer program with all the numbers in it and i haven’t a clue how to work the damn thing. 
If you can get this pile of shit in working order, you got a job. 
Alright? but hear me once, i’m not going to take your shit. 
you give me any shit, anything at all. 
you’re out of here. 
you get one shot.”
He didn’t want to shake hands or exchange names or information or anything. 
So Sawyer sat down and got to work.
It took him two hours to make sense of filing system and it took him another hour to rework it into something sensible. 
The Boss was pleased but didn’t want to appear overly grateful.
“Alright kid, you got yourself a job. 
Keep my books in order and i’ll make it worth your while. 
Here’s your first payment.” he handed Sawyer a hundred dollar bill. 
“Come back tomorrow around three. 
We can work on getting the rest of this mess in order. 
You might be going places, kid. 
Now get outta here, I’ve got work to do.” And with that he had a job and no where to stay but most of the strip was on all the time. 
He just needed a place to nap and a bathroom to use. 
Things were looking up. 
At least as up as they could.
--- well, so much for action.
So i’m in this cafe in Japantown and i have a double americano and a few hours of battery life and that should be enough to get something done, but i don’t know how much time i have before distra
see i got halfway through that word and stopped for a good half hour. 
what a chump. 
that’s the problem with cafes. 
too much going on everywhere. 
I need an isolation chamber or something. 
The temptation to actually practice all this business i’ve been researching is too much. 
I’ve managed to take over the router at this cafe. 
I can change the admin password, the wifi login, etc. 
I was hoping to find a way to put in a backdoor and a sniffer to capture all the traffic from home. 
And the temptation is just to see if i can. 
How much can i really get away with in an hour at a coffee shop. 
Quite a bit it would seem. 
But nothing as scary as some people could manage. 
If i were a better hacker, I’d have this whole shop and everyone in at my fingertips. 
I was tempted to bring my external WiFi unit and set up a fake router. 
That would be doable. 
It’s only a matter of running a few scripts, setting a few options. 
Click, sniff, wait. 
The thing is that most people don’t notice little things like when your connection switches from https to http. 
that little ‘s’ was all that was keeping a third party from seeing everything you send over the wire. 
Your bank information, your facebook, your email. 
I turned everything i’ve got to use two step verification the other week. 
At least no one can get those accounts unless they find a way to spoof and intercept my phone traffic. 
Doing that requires some heavy radio equipment. 
Having a hard time focusing on this, which is shitty. 
I didn’t get a damn thing done on this page yesterday. 
A whole 1666 behind. 
All i had to do was open this thing and stare at it long enough for me to do something to it. 
I have time between running nmap. 
I can do both. 
Maybe…
OK regrouping… where are we in this story. 
our hero(??) is in Reno, he got a job for now and a shady ass boss. 
that’s all fine and dandy. 
We should maybe check in on Mr. 
President and the eastern europeans. 
I think that’s the only other types i’ve written. 
I’m getting close to the halfway point and need to get there by sunday. 
that’s 6k words in two days. 
Super doable. 
I can do that all over the place. 
Not even a little problem. 
just need to psych myself up a little bit. 
All the people have left the cafe anyway. 
Great. 
gogogogo.
----
One of the dining rooms in the White House is especially for luncheons. 
Most of these were conducted with various leaders of industry, heads of states, Mr. 
President’s personal advisors. 
There was a lot of talks that happened in this little nook. 
The room was flooded with light from a bay windows. 
Attached to the underside of the table, some of the chairs, a few of the paintings were radio transmitting bugs from the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, old KGB, new KGB, MI6, MI5, Mr. 
President’s personal bugs, and a few randoms stuck there from various independant guests of the White House over the years. 
The room was like a diner booth near a community college except all the gum under the table was listening. 
There were two other men at the table aside from Mr. 
President. 
They were drinking screwdrivers made with pre-soviet vodka and fresh squeezed orange juice flown in from Spain.
“A lovely lunch as always, Mr. 
President. 
You’re chef has never been better.” One of the gentleman at the table says, pulling a black box from his coat pocket. 
“Forgive my assumptions, but I think this might be necessary to jam this room.” He pushes a red button and a high frequency tone screams out over the perceptible range of the people in the room. 
All the bugs are hit with a deafening squeal. 
In vans parked all over the Washington DC area dozens of agents rip off their headphones in a fit of pain and swearing.
“I think we should have some level of privacy now. 
You said this was a matter of national security and we agree. 
We’ve been keeping an eye on Romania for the last few years, or really since ‘46. 
The Ukraine has been a little more difficult to keep a hold in. 
Unrest and all that. 
We’ve managed to get a handfull of sleepers in as of late. 
It doesn’t look good. 
There’s some very wealthy people that want to break us. 
They’re offering bounties on agent lists and any databases they can get from the outside. 
We can’t afford another Snowden or God forbid, another Wikileaks.” The man that did most of the talking wasn’t from one of the three letter acronym agencies. 
His organization was older and more clandestine. 
They didn’t have a name. 
They had their fingers in all the pies and strings for all the puppets. 
I wouldn’t say they had total control, but i would say they had influence and information. 
They also didn’t have to answer to anyone under Mr. 
President himself. 
Even then, they considered this a low level meeting. 
Presidents come and go. 
They had been firmly in their position since they splintered off from the OSS before the CIA was formed. 
Their training was rigid and spanned a wide variety of diciplines. 
They were the top of the tops, often faking the deaths of agents from other organizations and resurecting them with a new name and a new life. 
C’est le espionage.
“Can we sabotage from the inside? I want to say bomb the fuckers, i really do. 
But everyone is telling me we can’t just bomb them without getting everyone declaring war. 
What about a drone strike? We could disguise a drone as coming from Russia, the media will believe that. 
Russia would love to bomb the Ukraine again.” Mr. 
President is eager to push the big red button. 
he’s starting to get an erection just thinking about it.
“Afraid we’re going to have to keep this as cold as possible. 
We can’t even borrow a seal team. 
It would be best if we didn’t have to send anyone in at all. 
Our counter espionage units are fairly close now. 
And we have a few sleepers, like i said before. 
This is going to be a bit more complicated than just walking in, firing up and EMP and hoping we knock out enough to set them back. 
That’s about all that would happen, just a delay. 
We don’t know where the money is coming from. 
And that’s going to be the key to stopping this.”
“A quick and dirty money cut. 
Just freeze the assets? I guess that’s ok. 
I want you guys to get me a name. 
I want to know every person on every bounty. 
We probably don’t have a lot of time. 
I want this before the week is up Gentlemen.” Mr. 
President started to get up from the table and the two men with him got up also. 
They did the buttons on their jackets and shook hands. 
The man pressed the red button on the little black box and the high pitched frequency stopped. 
A flurry of people in vans all over DC put their headphones back on and eagerly waited to hear something important.
“And tell your chef that the quiche was just divine. 
I should like to hire her for a weekend at Camp David. 
Maybe we should have a retreat when this whole mess is behind us.” They clap each other on the back and laugh about it. 
Either way, they’ll have a weekend retreat and their kids will go swimming and their wives will gossip. 
And the men will drink brandy and smoke cigars and talk about their mistresses and foreign affairs and investments. 
It will be a lovely weekend, hardly a care in the world.
-------
In an abandoned hotel in a small Romanian town there’s a group of ten young men huddled around screens propped up on old wooden tables from the soviet era. 
The electricity has been rigged from the city's power grid, they guy that did the wiring worked for the city, he wasn’t that expensive to get the job done. 
The internet connection was much the same story. 
These government workers were a lot cheaper these days. 
Greasing palms would get you a blind eye and as good a wiring job as you could get.
The crowd is all young men, most of them self educated. 
Thanks to getting internet access, a lot of them dropped out of school and learned on their own. 
And because it was so easy, many of them took to running scams as a part time, and very lucrative job. 
Fraud is a lot easier when you don’t have to show your face. 
Even easier still when everything you need to know to run the scam is already a few searches away. 
It takes about twenty minutes on average to get to know someone online. 
You can find address, phone number, friends, relatives, job history, education. 
Some of that information has been cataloged by companies that needed to. 
The rest we provided. 
Signing up for accounts that have public displays. 
It all gets cataloged. 
and it’s all so easy to find.
Different scams required different approaches and types of information. 
The easiest and most common was to exploit sexual appetites and loneliness. 
The scammers would pose as women who often had recently lost a loved one. 
They would provide pictures copied from revenge porn sites, where ex-boyfriends post pictures and video of some girl that broke up with them. 
Take that, some sad backstory, and you’d have men all over the world sending you money for plane tickets, for funeral expenses, for buying a new watch, a new car, whatever you wanted. 
It was too easy. 
They would sit in internet cafes and chat up other men across the globe, squeezing out a few dollars here and there and occasionally a large sum. 
When they wanted to know what became of their little investment, something would always come up. 
Some of these men would be strung along for years. 
Others, it was just a grab and go. 
They would be too embarrassed to report anything. 
Most of them had wives. 
It wouldn’t look good that they lost a few thousand dollars to support some poor girl in Syria. 
Sure, you could make it look like charity, but that was always a stretch.
That was always how it started with this crowd. 
Then they would learn more advanced forms of phishing. 
Phishing takes the ‘ph’ in its name from the old phone phreaks. 
The basic idea behind phishing is that you coerce people into giving up information by making yourself look like a credible source. 
They had tools to clone a website, making you think you were logging into your bank or your email. 
They had a dummy server set up that will log your credentials, then send you off to the real site saying that the password was incorrect, please try again. 
in the mean time, they had a database full of usernames and passwords for your bank account. 
The system was very simple.
Collect as many email address as possible. 
Clone an email from the bank so that all the text and graphics look exactly like the real thing. 
Tell the customer that they found something on their account requires their immediate attention, have them click a link from the email to the dummy server, they log in, it doesn’t work, they log in again, and everything appears normal. 
Little do they know, they’ve given everything away. 
And over in Romainia and the Ukraine, and Nigeria, someone is harvesting that information, reselling it, or siphoning money from it to a private account somewhere else.
They developed what they call spear phishing, which is where you target an individual, or small group of individuals. 
Say you wanted to get access to a company’s server. 
You go over to LinkedIn, find the company and harvest all the email addresses attached to that company. 
If you’re running linux, you can download a script that will do this for you. 
Next, forge an email from the system administrator saying that something is going down, or some system needs to be reconfigured and everyone needs to go reset their passwords. 
You clone the company pages, figure out what software they use for all this, easily done with a few searches or spidering the company website, and set up a duplicate site that is on your own server. 
Most people won’t know the difference and just click away because it’s their job. 
Because they're used to it. 
and it’s just another hassle from the IT department.
After that, you have access. 
From their it’s a matter of escalating privilege. 
This is accomplished by either exploiting a bug in the software that will break and transfer you over to an administrative account, or most of the time, that information is already there, you just need to find it. 
Once found, most of these credentials are encrypted and the average person thinks, great, case closed. 
Not the case by a long shot. 
If you’re no good at picking a password, it’ll take between one and fifteen minutes to crack the code. 
If you’re smarter, it could take a few days. 
If you’re really clever, if will take much too long and the attacker will likely give up. 
Sometimes an encrypted password can take years. 
The way it works is like this, you have a password, let's say it’s ‘vanilla’ when you enter that password into a computer it runs it through a very complicated bit of math called an algorithm. 
This takes ‘vanilla’ and turns it into ‘e8228fbca27926470a009c04a6af6df5’. 
(that’s an MD5 hash, if you want to know the algorithm.) The math is such that simply reversing it is impossible. 
So what the clever code breakers figured out was that we can take a list of words, run it through the same algorithm until we get a match. 
With a modern computer this can take little more than seconds for a word like ‘vanilla’. 
However, if your password was ‘I like vanilla ice cream’ it will take much longer. 
The reason being that phrases are not listed in a word file. 
And having a list of phrases would take much longer to figure out and be an extravagantly large file. 
Throw in some symbols and numbers to make, ‘I l1kE v@n1lla Ic3 Cream’ and you have a password that will take years to decrypt. 
Once again, that depends on how fast your computer can translate the words into hashes.
In Romania one of the kids looks up from the group and says,
“I got it. 
I’ve got the hash file.” He smiles a very proud smile. 
One of the other kids goes to a cooler and gets a round of beers for everyone. 
From this point most of the process will be automated. 
They’ll split the hash file into workable pieces, and each person will let it run until all the passwords have been recovered. 
That was all their employer wanted from this job. 
These kids knew that this information was more valuable than that. 
They would keep it and resell it as many times as possible. 
There were many enemies of this company. 
The fact that they had some rather large military contracts with the United States made it that much more desireable. 
For now, in Romania, they would drink, and they would wait. 
In the US, on a military contract server in the midwest, no one is awake to notice a few files being transferred. 
No one is there when a backdoor is installed to look like a normal service. 
They will show up for work tomorrow and no one will notice a damn thing. 
Because they have security measures in place and they trust them. 
How can their be a fire if the alarm never goes off?
------
Sawyer peeks through his curtain at the street below his apartment. 
The van is still there. 
It hasn’t moved. 
The damnest thing was how clean it was. 
There were trees all up and down the street. 
There was bird shit on every other car parked along it. 
But not the van. 
The van remained untouched by nature. 
Pristine and black and haunting. 
It sent a chill down Sawyer’s spine as he drank his coffee. 
He rememebered seeing simular vans a few other times. 
But mostly he remembered the first time. 
He remembered the look on his friends faces as they were tossed in the back of the cop cars. 
He remembered that feeling of fear and helplessness. 
He had never been so scared in his life. 
He closed the blinds. 
He had to go to work that day and every part of him didn’t want to leave the house. 
He backed up everything he might want or need on his computer. 
He did a low level format all all his hard drives. 
Guess it’s time to start fresh again. 
He began thinking about if it was time to move again. 
If he was ready for it. 
He had enough money saved up, that wouldn’t be the problem. 
But he had made the mistake of settling down to much. 
He had too much stuff here. 
In his mind that meant he had more than he could pack up and haul on a bus in twenty minutes. 
His beauitful machine that he’d been building over the last few years. 
The last few quiet years he’d spent writing code, doing a little light breaking and entering. 
Not hurting nobody. 
just for fun. 
He let his guard down. 
He got ready for work thinking about all these things. 
About how he’d become soft and careless. 
He could easily end up in the back of a cop car too. 
He always did his best to cover his tracks but there’s always a little bit of digital residue left over. 
Somethings you can’t erase with out being in the same room. 
He was getting nervous. 
He packed his laptop in with his work uniform, a few other things he couldn’t live without, a change of clothes. 
Took a look at his apartment, and hoped he’d be able to come back to everything being in one piece. 
He locked the door and made his way to the elevator.
In the lobby of his build there were two cops. 
They were talking to the building manager. 
Sawyer ducked behind a wall and ran through the list of alternative exits to the building. 
He checked his watch. 
Trying to not attract any attention, he walked slowly to the stairs and went up a floor. 
He made his way across to the other side of the building and down to a side door that spit out on the opposite street. 
He looked around before getting all the way out. 
He didn’t want to act suspicious. 
But he was doing it anyway. 
Being cautious can be seen as suspicious to some people. 
He kept telling himself to act casual. 
You’re just a guy that’s going to work, he told himself.
The few blocks he had to walk to the train station were wraught with looking over his shoulder, trying not to bump into things. 
It was slow going. 
By the time he made it to the restaurant he was ten minutes late. 
All bad, he kept thinking. 
This is all bad. 
His boss. 
A kind lady in her early forties stopped him.
“You’re late Tim.” She wasn’t smiling. 
She usually smiled when she talked to him.
“I, i’m sorry. 
won’t happen again.” He didn’t want to look in her eyes, he never really liked to look people in the eyes.
“Look, this isn’t like you and the last few days haven’t been like you. 
Is there something going on? Do you need someone to talk to?” She wasn’t smiling, but there was still a kind of kindness and concern in her face.
“Just overslept a bit. 
really, that’s all.” He was stuttering and fidgeting. 
He was used to showing up to work, doing his job and going home. 
No one bothered him and he didn’t bother anyone else. 
Except that one dishwasher.
“Ok, as long as that’s all. 
Suit up, we’re going to have a busy night.”
She wasn’t kidding about the busy night. 
There was a convention in town for something or other. 
The crowd looked very techie. 
Lots of name badges and guys in smart casual dress code khaki pants with long sleeve button up shirts with the sleeves rolled up the elbow. 
They all had black leather padded briefcases. 
Most of them had beards to varying degrees. 
They bought a lot of food and even more drinks. 
Some of them didn’t really understand that when the kitchen is closed that means there’s no one back there to cook for you anymore. 
That the bar is closed so it’s time to take your party somewhere else. 
He was making some of the last rounds, picking up glassware stashed behind the plants by the host stand, finding fallen forks underneath the booths. 
He brought a tub of dirty dishes and food scraps and soiled linens back to the dishwasher and went through the motions of scraping the food off, separating everything into like piles. 
He thought he was about done. 
He went up to the bar to see if they needed anything. 
There was still one guy sitting down, taking his sweet time with his last drink. 
The bartender was just about done cleaning up.
“Do you need anything? The dining room is pretty much done.”
“Thanks Tim, I’ve got it from here. 
Just one more thing to take care of,” She eyed the man sitting down. 
“Actually, you want to go drop off his tab? That’d be a real help, thanks.”
Sawyer walked over to the table and put the folded reciept down near the man's glass.
“Whenever you’re ready, sir.”
“Heh, Tim? Is that what you call yourself now?”
“Excuse me?” Sawyer looked down at the man for the first time. 
His hair was tied back in a long pony tail. 
His face was rough, but clean shaven.
“It’s been a while, Sawyer.” Cut looked up from his glass of scotch to get a good look at his old accomplice’s face. 
“Been a damn long while.”
--------
I wrote some words on social media about the tragedies that took place over the last few days i did my best to keep it succinct and respectful. 
We live and die by soundbites these days and today I’ve been mulling over the shootings and the bombings and when i got home i thought, i need to get good and drunk and angry and let it all out. 
Mostly because i can’t afford a therapist. 
But i can’ afford to write it down. 
That is, after all, one of the points of this month’s exercise.
The funny thing about social media, is that it’s like giving everyone you know or want to follow a bull horn. 
Then you walk into this room and all these people are shouting at you. 
This endless stream of opinions and thoughts and advertisements. 
And we see it all the time and we become numb and dumb to it. 
We have people we consider friends that go through hard times and good times and we just scroll by. 
Pressing like, or favorite. 
thinking we’ve done our part. 
Believing that our clicks make a difference. 
Dollars and sometimes even votes make a difference. 
but at the end we’re all defeated.
Our likes don’t make a difference. 
Our reposting and sharing don’t do any good. 
Spreading awareness, you might think. 
Getting the word out. 
Let the people know what’s going. 
And then what? Does anyone remember the occupy movement? What did that ever do? We got a lot of people very mad. 
And that anger is good. 
hold on to that. 
Let it be your guide. 
But the reality is still the same. 
Nothing changed. 
If anything the 1% is more powerful now than ever before. 
And they know it. 
The 99% showed that the most they could do was gather in the street and yell a lot. 
Maybe throw some molotovs around. 
Most likely, end up in jail. 
Protest never accomplishes anything. 
Our collective anger only ends up with more political prisoners. 
And even still those prisoners are just another one of you or me. 
Homeless, unemployed, Either way. 
The media will spin it however they will. 
No one is going to show up to the polling booths anyway. 
The guns end up in the hands of those paid to do a job. 
The may have morals, or ideas. 
They might be damn good people at the heart of it. 
But they didn’t have anything else going on, so they took a job. 
And they still have rent and wife and a kid or a husband and bills to pay. 
So they put on swat gear and stand in a row and shoot tear gas and hate what’s happening too. 
What can they do? What can anyone do after the fact. 
I’ll wager that the aftermath of all this is going to mean less freedom, more police, and more surveillance. 
Justification for aggressive political action. 
The same kind of action that provoked all of this in the first place. 
People keep forgetting that we made the terrorists. 
Go back and check out 1946. 
Go see what the civilized world did after the second world war. 
Go look at how we, in our infinite wisdom thought it would be ok for us to toy with the boarders, to send occupation troops into foreign lands. 
set up camp all over the world like we owned it. 
We made this. 
We built the terrorists. 
Not just in the middle east, but also in south america, in africa. 
The Whole continent of Africa. 
Not just one country. 
The western world, in it’s utter arrogance, thought they were doing something good. 
At very least something good for business. 
And business was good. 
The war machines have made out like bandits to the tune of billions of dollars. 
Many billions of those have been payed for by taxpayers. 
By votes. 
Democracy and capitalism might actually work, but just like communism, they are subject to human greed and idiocy. 
All political systems are wrought with failure because people are involved. 
Going back to the story i’m trying to write, people are always the weakest link. 
often we go back to the story of the ants. 
The metaphor we love as the underdog. 
how the many oppressed outnumber the few in power. 
and all we need to do is rise up and take action. 
That happened in France. 
it was a bloodbath. 
It happened, kind of, in America. 
It was also a blood bath. 
We have several thousand years of human history on record, most of it is violence and bloodshed. 
and What have we learned? We’ve learned how to make bigger explosives and more powerful guns. 
That’s about it. 
We have the majority of our resources, financial, political, scientifically, minerally, all devoted to the war machine. 
And while i understand that it’s gotten so out of hand that we have a justifiable amount dedicated to defense, the vast majority is poised, waiting to strike, on the offensive.
It just makes me so angry. 
It always has.
I remember back in high school, i was listening to college radio a lot. 
There was a broadcast that was an interview with someone that took a tour of a sweatshop down in mexico. 
I was livid. 
How could we do this to ourselves. 
What happened to people. 
I was raised in this christian idealist world where the golden rule was a real thing, where treating other people with kindness and respect and being humble and taking only what you needed was more than just a bumper sticker. 
And listening to this made me so mad because our teachers never said a word of this, every adult i’ve ever known never said that this was the reality of the situation. 
That our infrastructure failed because we made sweatshops and sold the work to third world kids that made pennies to make our shoes. 
Working in slave conditions because that was what you did for work.
We’re an incredibly adaptive species. 
We can survive in extremely brutal conditions. 
We can live and die in the worst ways possible. 
We can put up with all manner of terrible things. 
That’s how we survived. 
What’s gross about it is that we’ve taken advantage of it. 
We abolished slavery and put up sweatshops. 
Almost in the same breath.
Macbeth’s soliloquy was one of the most profound things i ever learned in my youth. 
it sums up social media, the news, and most everything i’ve ever heard since. 
Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
I feel the same way about my writing. 
I don't’ believe it will accomplish anything. 
I don’t have any grandiose ideas about saying anything profound. 
I know i’m just one white man versus the world. 
And in this day and age that means less to my merit than ever before. 
Just be being a white man i’ve already lost credibility. 
I’ve already wasted my words on deaf ears. 
You’re the privileged majority, you have no right to have a say in anything. 
You don’t know about oppression. 
You don’t know about racism. 
you don’t know about discrimination. 
You don’t know and you can’t know. 
Because you’re white and you’re a man. 
And Because of the circumstances of your birth, your opinion is invalid. 
I don’t mean to play the pity me, i’m the poor white man card. 
I’m just saying, if you’re going to cry racist and sexist, don’t be a racist and sexist right back at me.
I’m just really overwhelmed by the amount of shit that’s happened in the news lately. 
The overwhelming amount of death. 
The sheer volume of body count. 
it’s enough to make us all numb to the numbers. 
the math doesn’t lie and it hurts. 
and in between it all we expected to just carry on with our lives. 
I haven’t been provoked to tears since the 9/11 attacks. 
provoked to tears in the sense that i cried because of people i don’t know. 
that the sheer amount of tragedy overwhelmed me. 
i can’t write anymore tonight. 
----
That sucked the life out of me for last day or so. 
And i’m behind now. 
Fuck it. 
no time to dwell in the past. 
Let’s recap and try and get back in it.
So we cut and sawyer reunited, we have the higher ups planning a cold op in eastern europe. 
romania is moments away from starting a massive chain reaction. 
i don’t think i have anything else going on. 
That’s considerably less than how i usually tackle this project. 
I guess past and present MC is almost like a dual character. 
We can do a little flash back before we get back into our little reunion. 
That seems like the best course of action. 
WHEN WE LAST LEFT OUR HERO, HE WAS ROMPING AROUND RENO…
------
Sawyer awoke as was his custom in those days in the early afternoon. 
The desert sun baking his long term hotel room, turning any amount of air flow and open windows into a convection oven. 
He never managed to get a proper bed, sleeping on an old mattress without any covers on floor. 
He had his winter clothes in a pile, his summer clothes in another pile. 
The laptop he managed to save up for by the head of the mattress. 
His back pack with cables and wires and a handful of small tools. 
A few handy things he managed to build from scraps of radio equipment. 
He had been in Reno for a little over two years. 
And he was starting to get an itch to move on. 
He had a good amount of cash saved up. 
Enough to get a bus ticket west, enough to have a place to stay and something to eat when he got there. 
To supplement his accountant gig, he started taking jobs at various restaurants and casinos, mostly busing tables. 
There wasn’t a whole lot else for him to do in this down. 
Not when he was trying to keep a low profile. 
He did manage to forge some decent looking identities. 
Just in case. 
He was a little obsessed with making sure he had a back up plan. 
He wasn’t going to get caught like last time. 
He swore he was going to be prepared for the worst.
Ever since the attacks last september, he was even more careful. 
He saw how the police were being transformed into a state militia. 
He saw how the suspiciousness of the general populace was on the rise. 
How standing out in any way would be grounds for people to make phone calls to anonymous tip lines. 
His goal was to blend in. 
Not do anything to attract attention to himself. 
And so he worked, kept his head down, and prepared for shit to the fan, either a war breaking out at home, or his past catching up to him. 
He had the luxury of not being attached to anyone in town. 
He had somehow escaped the traps and temptations of the opposite sex, confining himself to his roach hotel room, his jobs. 
Getting paid cash whenever possible. 
Forging a plausible enough identity to cash a check if need be. 
Being as untraceable as he could. 
It wasn’t too hard in this town. 
Most people didn’t want to know anything about you. 
It was like a crumby version of Vegas, with money coming in from the ski slopes over the mountains in Tahoe. 
Most of the locals were stuck there with thoughts that would one day leave town. 
Head over to California. 
Live that endless summer life. 
Most of them never made it, placing the wrong bets, gambling their winnings back to the house. 
Classic mistakes. 
Sawyer didn’t gamble. 
He was curious about card counting and breaking blackjack. 
But the risks outweighed the reward. 
For fun, he took his accounting work around town and that got him access to most of the computer and banking systems. 
He didn’t even have to do anything. 
They just told him how to get in so he could balance the books. 
It bored him. 
He missed the thrill of the hunt. 
He missed digging through dumpsters, trying to find printouts. 
He missed the way Cut would call up an office and talk his way into gaining remote access. 
He missed watching Tran rig the phone lines so they could trick caller ID systems into thinking they were calling from anywhere they wanted. 
This made it even easier to trick people into giving up valuable information. 
He missed the late nights they’d spend chain smoking over cans of cola, laughing about their conquests.
The game had changed a lot over the last few years. 
More and more dial-ups were disappearing. 
The networks were all moving to the internet. 
everything was getting more connected. 
All the old phone numbers were being replaced by internet protocol addresses. 
The tools were changing with the territory. 
Sawyer was running a custom linux build. 
He rewrote much of the software, which was also easier now, thanks to the open source movement. 
There were a host of new languages to learn as well. 
He taught himself PERL and HTML rather quickly. 
The migration over to internet also meant that targets were more varied. 
He wasn’t limited to anything in his area code anymore. 
He could dial up one of the service providers and from there poke around networks on the east coast, or the midwest or the south. 
or Europe. 
or Russia. 
Funny thing about computers, no matter what language you speak, you have to write code in english. 
This made Sawyer’s hobby that much easier for him. 
He could read website’s code like you or I could read a flyer on a phone poll. 
He could look at program code and figure out what was going on before running it. 
He found some other hobbyists and would help them debug their code and submitted some things of his own. 
All anonymously of course. 
It was a little easier in those days to stay hidden behind a screen name. 
Especially if you were jumping around between different free providers. 
Or using hijacked accounts. 
The security was pretty lax in those days. 
A lot of people were new to this. 
They didn’t even think about the idea of someone trying to break in. 
They were more concerned with trying to make it work in the first place. 
The software was breaking, seemingly on its own, more often than not. 
Sawyer had a bad habit of breaking into a network, finding some broken software and fixing it. 
Sometimes he would leave a note for the admin. 
More often he wouldn’t, getting a kick out of some guy logging in to find his code working all of a sudden. 
Blaming it on computer magic. 
He knew there was probably some good money in his skills. 
He also knew he had a record and was still at large. 
Forever a fugative. 
He was going to have to keep his real name out of everything. 
The digital equivilent of playing dead.
He managed to crawl off the matress in the mid afternoon heat and get a glass of water from the sink. 
He looked around the room and decided it was time to pack it up. 
He turned off his laptop and packed the power cord. 
he fit what clothes he could, making sure to account for the trip over the mountains, which was sure to have some cold points. 
He rounded up the rest of his stuff in trash bags and hauled them down to the Goodwill. 
He walked down to the bus station and bought a ticket. 
And without looking back, he got on the bus and headed west.
------
I’m going to start following the oldest piece of writing advice i ever got, which is to keep making things worse for the characters. 
So with that in mind….
-------
The bus made it to the top of the mountain before one of the tires blew. 
It wasn’t one of those cute puncture holes where the air slowly leaks out, making a slow motion comical whoopie cousin like sound. 
It was a bang. 
A boom. 
and the bus lost it’s balance like a still drunk man trying to tip toe out of a party in the early morning avoiding landing his feet on the still sleeping deziens of late last nights festivities. 
The bus driver tried to hit the brakes and pull the wheel. 
The bus lurched and tilted, trying to compensate for having it’s front foot kicked out from under it. 
Teetering on the narrow mountain road, the passengers, still fresh in the horror of international bombings and airplanes flying into buildings, heard only the banging and booming and the shockwaves and the motion sickness. 
They went into hysyterics almost immediatly. 
The screaming didn’t help the driver any. 
He tried to put his expirience on this road to good use. 
He’d driven this road in storms of all kinds, through every season and weather pattern that could hit. 
And this just wasn’t his day. 
Into the mountain, he thought. 
If you have to crash this thing, go into the mountain. 
Don’t go over the edge. 
Just get the bus to stop. 
The three remaining tires caught a patch of ice and suddenly stopped taking direction from the steering wheel. 
Onward and forward slid the bus, a victim of momentum. 
If it weren’t for the fact that they were on a downward slope, everything might have gone differently. 
Into the guardrail the bus crashed, bending and pulling out the wooden poles, twisting the thin steel aroudn the form of the bus.
Everything seemed to stop except the people screaming, convinced they were going to die, offering nothing in a time of crisis except a loud caucouphanus bluster. 
Metal creaked and adjusted, the bus leaning over the edge of the mountain, swaying in the wind. 
Sawyer found himself lucky to be in the back of the bus. 
He was mister low profile and the back of the bus is always where you sit in that situation. 
The only attention you get there is from the drunks and crusty street kids and the left overs of Jerry Garcia’s children. 
Sawyer usually had headphones and his trusty walkman. 
He had ripped the headphones off and regretted subjecting himself to the sounds of panic coming from the bus. 
Some army vet type was trying to calm down the mothers and their kids and the panic stricken others. 
He reassured them that they weren’t dead yet and if everyone kept calm they might all get out of this alive. 
He tried to tell them that they had to Kick the emergency exit window out of the back and slowly work their way out without tipping or rocking the bus back. 
He was very loud and made people listen to him. 
He didn’t go through the shit storm of serving in war overseas to die in a bus crash in the mountains above reno. 
He wasn’t going to die like this. 
He yelled and told the people at the back to kick the shit out of that window and pull the release handles and start crawling out the back. 
He told the rest of the people in the bus to work their way, slowly towards the back.
The people were still in a panic. 
They were clawing and rushing to the back as fast as they could, pushing each other out of the way before the bus took a nosedive to the crags below. 
Sawyer and the bum next to him had managed to get half the window loose and were working on the other half when the crowd pushed up against them. 
The window popped open. 
The crowd having nowhere to put their momentum fell towards the front of the bus. 
Sawyer and the bum fell out the back with the window and hit the ground shoulders first and saw the bus full of screaming people tilt over the guardrail and with a motion that was more like giving up, plumet what looked like a hundred feet down, rolling against the side of the mountain, glass shattering in the screams, the metal frame of the bus crushing and twisting like an oversized beer can against the forehead of a mountainous man. 
The bum rolled over coughing. 
Sawyer slumped over in the snowy dirt of the summer, breathing heavy, eyes wide.
The bum recovered enough to evaluate the situation.
“Wheelll hot shit and damnation! ain’t we the lucky son’sabitches.”
Sawyer wasn’t ready to talk yet, but i think he gave the bum a look. 
He was still breathing pretty hard. 
He wasn’t sure about what was behind his look, he was right there with the bum, they were the lucky ones. 
At the same time, they very nearly were not at all. 
At the same time a good forty or so people just fell to their deaths in piss smelling state run bus. 
At the same time some of them were probably still alive. 
He was pretty sure he could hear some of their screams, floating up the side of the mountain.
“Holy hot fuck in hell. 
What a ga’damn rush.” The bum was almost dancing around in circles, shaking his hands and his head and utterly the odd, “wooo!” and “Ohboy!”
Sawyer had managed to twist his body into a sitting position and gain control of his breathing. 
He looked at the scene of the dancing bum and the edge of the cliff were a bunch of people just died, or were in the process of dying, or maybe were lucky enough or not to survive the fall.
“we should do something…” he managed to say weakly, maybe at the bum, maybe to himself. 
Maybe to god. 
He wasn’t sure.
“Do something? Do something?! you’re damn right we oughta do somethin’! we oughta get the shit off this damn mountain is what!”
“no man. 
i mean, like. 
about those people over there.”
“Who them? they dead or good as dead. 
You a doctor? you a nurse?! a trained medical professional?! you don’t look like one. 
You don’t look like one at all. 
You just look like me. 
A waste’a’ga’damn space.” The bum’s dance was slowly spiraling down. 
“Damn thin mountain air. 
Can’t much make a motion in this stuff.” The bum took a look around. 
They were sitting in the middle of the road and there was a huge chunk of guardrail taken out on one side.
“There could be survivors! shouldn’t we do something?”
“Nah. 
Fuck ‘’em. 
You want to risk your lucky ass to save those screaming shitheads? i didn’t think so. 
Let’s get down from here. 
Never thought i’d want to get back to the heat. 
But shit it’s cold up here and when that sun goes down it’s only gonna get colder. 
you hear me? let’s move.”
Sawyer pulled himself off the asphalt and found his land legs again. 
His backpack was down in that bus. 
He was kicking himself for not throwing it out in front of him. 
He his clothes and his wallet and that was it. 
He wasn’t dressed for a night in the mountains. 
It was best to get moving. 
stay warm. 
The bum was following the road and Sawyer was following the bum.
“Shouldn’t we wait for a rescue team?” Sawyer managed to say.
“OH yeah, we should. 
when do you think they’ll show up? Today? Tonight? Next week? fuck’em. 
We can make it town before we die tonight. 
We stand more of a chance trying to hitch a ride out of here. 
Ain’t much but the daily bus and a few logging trucks that take this road. 
Could be days before anyone finds those sorry shits.”
The flurry of emotions that hit sawyer over the last hour were being over ridden by two prevailing feelings. 
He was scared of dying up from freezing to death, and he was really annoyed. 
That this was happening at all. 
That he was stuck with this bum. 
That he forgot his backpack. 
In the face of a near death expirience, he found himself, mostly irritated.
---
Not bad right? a little action. 
A little spicy up. 
a little something to chew on maybe. 
Who knows. 
I’ve got another 13 days of dishing out shit to everyone in this story. 
Maybe i’ll introduce a character just to shit all over them. 
Maybe i will. 
Maybe i’ll see where this idea of starting off each writing session with just make it worse. 
Whatever is happening in the story, make it worse for everyone. 
I have to say, i was half tempted to kill Sawyer in his own flashback. 
just be like, oh shit, sorry folks, alternate timeline. 
Then just keep killing the little bastard. 
It’s not too late. 
it’s a good plot device. 
Maybe someday people will enjoy a post modern novel like that. 
i’ve read a few people where everything and nothing happened. 
you have a hard time keeping track of who’s dead and who’s alive and who is a who and not someone’s armchair. 
It can get a little hairy. 
So i don’t know. 
I’m taking this beast into new territory. 
quite honestly, i may have been getting bored with the original idea. 
I’m still hip to playing out scenes from the new cold war in a way. 
But i’m not committed to anything right now. 
Just cranking out garbage. 
I am commited to that. 
If there’s one thing i know i can do. 
It’s be a shit factory. 
Alright, sixteen more words, and then I’m out of here. 
Gotta hit six six six six.
---
The house is quiet aside from the cats and me. 
So i‘m going to take advantage of the situation. 
I went out and had 3 beers and one tequila. 
which is putting me right in the feel good spot. 
The two tacos might have helped. 
but i’m all blanket wrapped and able to type. 
that’s the important part. 
ready to tackle this bastard bit of writing. 
The hardest part is being able to let go of my own narrative. 
Killing the narrator, as was aptly put in your own work. 
Trying to separate the me from my writing and make it it’s own thing. 
There needs to be some separation. 
I’m not writing a damn auto biography for christ’s sake. 
I don’t know what i’m writing. 
Just whatever seems interesting to me at the time. 
I think that’s a good enough point. 
treat it like an extended exercise. 
Remember what i’m trying to accomplish which at the baseline is just the act of writing at least 2000 words a day. 
If i can get back in that habit, i can do a lot more then write what amounts to a teenage fantasy novel with a bunch of jargon thrown in for kicks. 
The hardest part is snapping that narrator neck. 
Letting it go and letting the fingers do the walking. 
Trying to hold back the urge to dip into my linux environment and see if there’s any more stuff like last night, when i found some audit server on the subnetwork for a local school system where i grew up. 
Where no one bothered to change anything from the defaults. 
I managed to log in with the old ‘admin’ username ‘admin’ password. 
From there found the open file transfer protocol, downloaded the encrypted password file, decrypted it in about five minutes, logged in as the root account and found nothing of interest. 
Couldn’t upload to the web facing directory since they were smart enough to make it read only. 
But dumb enough to make it easy to use the highest level account. 
I don’t get it. 
If i had the skills, that server would have been mine to control. 
It would have been easy too. 
This story is bleeding a bit too much into my own brain and I’m in danger of believing it. 
I’d better get back in it and start making things worse. 
When in doubt, make everything worse. 
It’s always more entertaining to watch a character struggle.
-----
There were no streetlights in the mountains. 
That’s what bothered Sawyer the most. 
He couldn’t see too far ahead in the dark. 
Just enough to see the bum. 
It was too cold for either of them to talk much. 
Mostly silent. 
Almost completely dark. 
There was enough moon glow to know where your feet were falling. 
Enough feel left despite the cold to know you were walking on asphalt. 
They were both plugging along, arms close to the body, eyes looking both in front of the feet and to the horizon. 
trying to find a sign of lights. 
Looking for shelter. 
It was slow going. 
The road would start to dip, making them think they were finally on their way down only to dip back up a few meters later. 
They would pause every hour or so and share cigarettes, rarely talking, both of them knowing the cold was only going to grow with the dark. 
As evening turned into night and the sun was long gone and neither of them could tell how far they’d gone, or how far they had to go. 
The hot desert air from Reno seemed ages away. 
The unknown mountain town they plugged toward seemed impossible. 
What on earth had they gotten into.
“Hooooboy, my balls are frozen solid as rocks.”
“Let’s just keep moving, plea-eese.” he shivered.
‘Eh you see that!” the bum sounded excited.
Sawyer looked up and saw some light off in the distance. 
Maybe another mile or two down the road.
“Just a bit longer and we’ll be up to our nuts in hot soup and a warm bed. 
Told you as much.”
Just up the road they found the moonlit sign that said ‘Hinton 0.5 miles’ and that was all they needed. 
They scrambled as much as their legs could the rest of the way.
What they found on a arrival was bunch of trailer parks and a half built church. 
The half church would have to do for the night. 
It was enough shelter in the construction equipment and mostly built walls to keep the wind off their bodies while they tried to sleep. 
It was a long night.
When the sun and trucks pulling up pulled them out of a light sleep they both knew it was best to keep moving. 
The bum wasn’t much to try and get help from the locals here. 
There were mountain folk and didn’t take kindly to a couple of bums wanting a free meal. 
The only information they got was that Truckee was another few miles down the road. 
It would take them until late afternoon to get there. 
When they did, they found a diner and hot food and it was the closest thing to heaven. 
They gorged themselves on hot stew and sandwiches and fresh coffee. 
Sawyer picked up the tab discreetly, not wanting his traveling companion to know about his cash on hand. 
He was grateful they got this far, but wasn’t about to trust him. 
he was already stranded. 
he didn’t need to be broke and stranded. 
The bum took to mostly drinking his coffee and staring out the window. 
He was surprisingly quiet since they got to town.
“There’s a bus that’s gonna be passing through soon enough. 
We should get back to it.”
“You can go on ahead. 
I’ve got some things to take care of here.”
“whatever,” Sawyer said, stating the slogan of his generation.
He greedily finished his soup and coffee, left some money on the table and thought it best to get while he could.
He left the bum at the table, looking out the window and a thousand miles past it. 
He was eager to get this whole thing behind him. 
Plan A. 
If you can stick it, keep on with plan A. 
Sawyer walked out of the diner and down he street and bought warm coat.
The bus station was just like all the rest of them. 
Just a bit smaller. 
There was only two places to go from here. 
Sacremento or back to Reno. 
On to Sac he went. 
Bus was due in the next two hours. 
He stopped into the bar down the street to wait it out and have a few cheap beers in the meantime. 
The tv was playing news of the bus crash he was in. 
A couple dozen people dead. 
No survivors mentioned. 
He was mostly glad that they left. 
It wouldn’t have made a difference. 
He drank three bottles of cheap beer before he left to go wait at the bus stop.
-----
I’m not sure what to do now. 
I guess we should go back to present day. 
Need to focus. 
having a hard time trying to think of plausible ways for things to go wrong. 
There’s always the past catching up with you problem. 
but that’s kinda the present story line. 
What’s going to happen now that Cut has been reintroduced. 
is he going to try and recruit sawyer into some scheme. 
is he going to be bitter and resentful or suspicious about how Sawyer walked from the whole thing. 
Is he going to want revenge or is he going to try and save him from his mundane life of busboy by day. 
What’s going to happen in Romania. 
Will they succeed. 
Will the great US nation infiltrate and cause a ruckus. 
I don’t know.I over slept and i’m still sleepy. 
Maybe ate too much, Hemmingway always advised against writing with a full belly. 
I should listen to my mentors.
----
In a forest town in Romania they are clinking beers and toasting each other to another job well job. 
The money would be wired over soon enough and they would all be feasting and partying in the club with whores a plenty. 
They were having a good laugh over a joke someone told a minute ago about farm animals and country folk when the boss walked in.
“Glad to see everyone enjoying themselves. 
I hope we can keep this going, we just have one more thing to take care of.”
He walked around the group of guys with their beers. 
And their smiles all start to fade into looks of concern. 
He loops around once and he’s the only one with a smile now. 
It’s not really a smile. 
it’s the look someone has when they know something that no one else in the room knows. 
It’s a look that says something very bad is about to happen.
He grabs one of the guys by the hair as he circles around and drags him while he screams. 
He drags him a few feet away from the rest of the group and let's go so that his head hits the floor.
“It would seem that we have a traitor in our midst. 
I hope we don’t have to repeat tonights performance again.” He puts on a pair of black gloves and his assistant hands him a ball peen hammer.
“I’m sorry to the rest of you that we only found out about this too late.” He takes the hammer and comes down hard on the guys kneecap. 
There’s a dull crack followed by a high pitched scream.
“We usually can sniff these types out before it becomes a problem, but this one must have some nice connections.”
He takes the hammer and swings down on his other knee cap. 
Another scream and his pants are starting to turn red. 
His hands go towards the wound, there’s nothing he can do to stop or help the pain he’s in. 
His screams have turned into sobs moans of anguish.
The man with the hammer turns to the group of guys still holding their beers and looking more scared than ever. 
They remember the witch hunts during the occupations over the years. 
it was never pretty.
He takes the hammer and cracks it hard on the guys shoulder. 
right near the joint. 
if he’s not going to kill him, he’s going to leave him pretty useless. 
He walks to the other side and comes down again with the hammer in other shoulder. 
The man on the floor is a gasping pile of flesh, squirming on the ground, unable to comprehend his situation.
“our friend here,” the man with the hammer pauses slap the man on the ground in the temple with his weapon. 
“Our friend here, seems to think that he can get away with helping out our enemies in russia. 
He thinks he might still get paid on both sides. 
He is a fool!” and he brings the hammer down on the other side of the man’s head, leaving him to wriggle in his own blood, unable to walk, his arms dead at the shoulders, his mind subject to sheer blinding pain. 
“Take this trash out.” The man with the hammer says, and two men appear from the doorway and drag the bleeding victim from the room. 
He will be pulled down to the basement and thrown, barely alive into the incinerator used to heat the building. 
It will smell like burning man flesh for weeks. 
An olefactory reminder to the remainder of the men about loyalty.
About 25 clicks away a group of three special forces men are walking towards the town on the maps in the briefing room. 
They have their plan and they have about twenty four hours to execute.
They’re cold and the three of them alone have to take down what they’ve been told is a terrorist organization of unknown number. 
They’re equipped with some of the most expensive tech the military could afford to send them off with. 
They have the firepower to level a small town if need be. 
They also have the clearance. 
Just in case. 
The world will turn a blind eye and it won’t make national news, which is important. 
There’s enough political unrest in the area and has been for years. 
They had to start from airdrop and make the rest of the way on foot. 
The plan was to arrive at dusk, likely when the targets were all in place. 
Assess the building, infiltrate, and neutralize. 
Their team of three was to sweep from the bottom to the top, clean it up, and leave no trace of US involvement. 
Operations like this were taking place all over the world all the time. 
Only the mistakes made the news. 
This couldn’t afford to be a mistake. 
For every mistake the amount of enemies would grow. 
With every mistake it made it harder for the higher ups to get those budget cuts they needed for the bigger operations. 
Three men made a small price to pay if all would be lost. 
It also allowed for less mistakes. 
Once they were dropped they were told that all knowledge of their actions would be disavowed by the military and governments on all sides. 
They were a ghost squad.
By dusk they had spotted the building shown to them during the briefing. 
An old run down hotel. 
Activity on the fifth floor and the 11th. 
Guards at all doors. 
They stopped to go over the plan. 
The plotted a course to the top of the building, to cut all the wires going into and out. 
Jam all the wireless and take everything down. 
If they are successful, they can call in an airlift. 
if not, they’ll be left for dead. 
They carry no identification and wear no flags. 
They are the elite of the elite and they have no backup, no family, and will never be acknowledged for their service.

Honestly, i’m bored writing this weak rainbow six shit. 
big fucking deal. 
small task force versus some post cold war still cold war third world nerds. 
it’s not really what i would think of as exciting. 
it’s not great writing. 
maybe it’s all just a metaphor. 
it’s all very symbolic. 
it’s all just a load of garbage. 
whatever, the biggest problem is that when i don’t care i can’t type enough. 
i pause too much. 
or when i’m writing something i don’t know about then i have to stop and look things up. 
boring. 
bored, and stupid. 
write a bar scene. 
write about boys and girls and how terrible complicate that whole thing is. 
write about modern love or modern family or the conflicts of past ideals vs present day reality. 
write about the emptiness inside the writer and how his antisocial tendencies seem to exacerbate his dilemma. 
write about conflict and tragedy and society. 
write about people and how infinitely complex and utterly simple they can be. 
write about the dichotomy of balance. 
write about the subtleness of the state of being in between. 
write about the drunkard and five years sober ex drunkard. 
write about the gambler and the liers and the cheats. 
the whores and husbands that love them. 
write about children and their wisdom next to their insufferable behaviour. 
write about writing. 
but for god's sake. 
don't’ write a bunch of shit. 
i don’t know if i can anymore. 
Bukowski wrote about his life and the horror that he was trying to be a man with his demons on his sleeve and the idiots that he surrounded himself with. 
Kerouac wrote about the undying fire of youthful idealism confronting the reality of life with age and the dangers of substance abuse. 
Thompson wrote about sports and politics through the veil of the freak with too much time on his hands and access to drugs. 
Woodward and Bernstein wrote about Tricky Dick and the hotel of horrors and did it all with trenchcoat deep throat sources and cloak and dagger reporting style that made them famous. 
Robbins wrote like he sat at the kids table while Leary and Bob Wilson were high on acid carving a turkey made out of stars. 
Hemminway wrote like he was writing for the new york times and sick of everyone around him and had to drink all the time to be ok with it. 
Stienbeck wasn’t much different, just stuck in California. 
And what am I writing? A lenghty commentary about modern social politics with global politics thrown in because i spend every morning wondering why i woke up so i can read the headlines instead of living in my dreams.
It’s a sick sad world is one thing i’ve learned. 
It’s a piss stained shit pants of a life. 
That wouldn’t make a very good holiday feel good movie of the year. 
But it would be interesting. 
Christmas is canceled, go get a job. 
Go get a job so you can pay eighty percent of your income towards rent. 
Go get a job so you can pay taxes on wars that everyone denies that we’re fighting. 
or that we’ve been fighting them for so long that everyone has forgotton that there’s a war going on. 
Because it’s not at home. 
Something i read the other day when someone was complaining that Paris was getting all the attention after their tragedy and the half dozen other tragic things that happened that week weren’t getting the spotlight, the comment was, “You don’t report a fire in a furnace.” Which got me thinking. 
There have been so many headlines i’ve scrolled past about bombings, and shootings, and other horrible things. 
Oh, some guy in Florida raped and killed ten people. 
well that’s Florida for you. 
Oh, a bomb went off in iraq. 
When doesn’t a bomb go off in iraq. 
Oh the third world is having a rigged election after the last rigged election. 
The people are in the streets with banners and guns and marching. 
Big deal. 
But no one runs around Paris every day shooting up the town. 
That’s news. 
that’s new. 
it’s not what we’re used to. 
So before people start going off about all the unreported terrible things going on in the world, maybe they should actually read all the reports. 
Because they’re there. 
They still report all the bombs in Iraq, all the violence in Egypt, all the dumb shit that police get caught doing. 
It’s just that there’s so much of it that we’ve become numb and as a general rule, don’t collectively care. 
we can’t care about everything, that would be a lifetime of giving to charity, of cleaning up other people’s messes. 
that would be an unending storm of crap. 
and no one can deal with that. 
We still need bus drivers and mailmen. 
We still need school teachers and plumbers and fry cooks. 
We can’t all stop what we’re doing for an unending moment of silence. 
If the goal of terrorism is to disrupt the opulent lifestyle of the western world, then the best defence we have to is keep living it. 
throw your fingers in the air and order a cheeseburger. 
Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for it. 
Laugh, love, go to the movies. 
We live in such a fucked up world that even if you’re lucky enough to get past christian guilt, there’s heaps of other kinds of guilt people are trying to throw on you all the time. 
We can’t all help everyone, get real. 
We don’t all have the power or the resources to end world hunger or clothe the homeless or heal the sick. 
Because all the power rests in the hands of the higher ups. 
They could do it. 
They could stop everything. 
Stop making and selling guns, stop the war machine, stop throwing food away. 
But you and me, Joe and Jill Average, we got nothing, because we’re giving all to the gas pump and the landlords and the taxman.
-----
I’m having a bit of a hard time grasping where i left off. 
The kid is in Truckee, heading to the coast, the Romanians had a violent shake up, The americans are moving in for the kill. 
In present tense, They’re still at the restaurant, seeing each other’s faces after some ten years. 
The silent Tran is still elusive. 
We could write him out like he never made it past the system, or got deported. 
Or maybe he got out on good behaviour and started a company. 
Who knows. 
I should get back to the present and flesh out something that’s happening between the nerds. 
You can’t have a cliffhanger like that for too long before people forget what’s happening.
----
He was just sitting there with his long hair still there but pulled back. 
He was drinking scotch instead of cola now. 
He was wearing a suit instead of ripped jeans and punk rock shirts. 
He had a briefcase.
“It’s…. 
Good to see you, Sawyer.” He said, before taking a short sip of his drink, he set it down neatly, being sure to center it on the napkin.
“It’s been a long time, Cut.” Said Sawyer, standing but not sure what to do with himself. 
Part of him wanted to make an excuse and get out of there. 
Part of him wanted to hug his old friend. 
Part of him wanted to get his tab taken care of and get off work before dealing with what was clearly a personal problem.
“Please, call me Carter, That’s what they put on my business cards. 
Besides, those days are… behind me…” He looked around the room in a suspicious sort of way. 
The way bank robbers case a room every time they enter. 
Taking a note about all the cameras, security personnel, every exit in and out of the place.
“Hey, listen, i don’t mean to be a prick, let me finish up and we can go catch up somewhere else.”
“Oh yeah, right, this is your job. 
I don’t mean to make a scene. 
Sure, I’ll wait for your outside.” He pulls out his wallet and pays his tab. 
He leaves a fairly standard tip, takes his coat and walks out the front door.
Sawyer wipes the table off, takes the tab to the bartender, clocks out, and changes his clothes. 
He walks out the front door with his backpack, still carrying his laptop, his getaway supplies. 
He figures, what the hell, he didn’t want to go back home tonight anyway, might as well catch up with his dear old friend.
“What are you doing with yourself, man? I haven’t seen you in ten years and you’re out here bussing tables. 
Shit, man. 
I thought you would be running a software company by now, or getting a stock pay out or something, shit. 
You’re worth so much more than this…” he waves at the restaurant, “this..”
“I don’t know, man. 
every since… the last time i saw you, i’ve been keeping things kinda low key.”
“Kinda low key and doing everything short of leaving the country and faking your death, that’s a pretty broad spectrum. 
It’s taken me a long time to track you down.” Carter formerly known as Cut takes an expensive cigarette from his coat pocket and lights it, then offers one to Sawyer. 
Sawyer says no thanks, and pulls out his own pack. 
They find a bench and sit down, smoking.
“You know, for a while, I wasn’t sure if you had anything to do with Tran and I getting busted. 
It seemed a little too convenient. 
You getting off free while the two of us got hauled off like a couple of terrorists. 
I was angry and confused for a long damn time. 
Once I got out and started to reestablish myself, I figured out there was no way you were involved. 
You ran. 
You couldn’t have made a deal with anyone if you went running. 
That means you were scared. 
Ten years on the run. 
That must have been some fun times.” He flicks some ash and takes a long drag.
“I lost track of Tran when i was in the joint. 
From what i know, he was deported back to ‘Nam. 
He told me he was born here, either that was a lie, or they didn’t care. 
I don’t know what happened after that, except a guy like that is dangerous if he’s got a grudge. 
The way he could wire a phone line is nothing compared to what he could do with explosives with a little know how and the right people with him. 
I’m sure there’s plenty of people over in S.E.A. 
that want to take a swing at the old U S of A. 
We haven’t been the nicest to South East Asia over the years…” Carter looks over at Sawyer, who’s been staring at the ground and smoking two cigarettes for the one that Carter was working on slow.
“Jesus,” was all he could say. 
I mean, sure his life hadn’t been peaches and cream since that whole thing went down. 
But he didn’t get sent back to his home country, he didn’t spend hard time. 
He just ran from town to town, changing his name, working odd jobs.
“Hell, After that stunt you pulled in Reno, I thought you were dead. 
It wasn’t till you landed in Stockton and your work was just getting so easy to recognize. 
It was like you had a signature. 
The whole security community could see it.” Carter put his cigarette out and looked at his old companion.
“So, like, what happened to you, man?” Sawyer felt like an idiot saying it, but it was something that was on his mind for the last ten years. 
It would seem that he had left some traces of himself. 
Traces only someone like Cut would have been able to find.
“Oh you know, same old story. 
Spent a few years in the joint. 
Made some friends, you know how I can talk to people. 
Eventually, I got out on good behaviour and a favor. 
Feds needed a guy to help with one of the malware outbreaks back in 2005. 
They tapped me and I wanted to get out. 
Honestly, i spent a lot of their resources trying to track you down. 
It took me awhile before i realised that you had nothing to do with me being in jail and nothing to do with the malware outbreaks. 
That shit was all coming out of China and Russia. 
still is. 
But it took me some time to work that out and it ended up getting me a job. 
I’m a consultant now. 
funny, right?”
They both are looking at the stars or looking at the ground. 
Funny how life is. 
One guy ends up in jail, spends a few years in a waking nightmare, but cops a deal, and ends up with a career. 
His buddy spends his young adult life on the run, ends up bussing tables. 
What a crazy world.
But what about the van? What happened with the van?!
Back at Sawyer’s apartment, the power goes out. 
The floor above and the floor below go down with it. 
The phone lines go down too. 
There’s a man with a cell phone jammer the size of a mini fridge strapped to his back. 
He’s holding firm in the lobby while a team of six men in full swat gear march up the stairs. 
They Hold positions on both sides of the door, one man in each stairwell, one by the elevator. 
They give each other hand signals and on three they kick down the door.
They’re saying things like “GO GO GO.” and “GET DOWN” and “FREEZE YOU PIECE OF SHIT”
They turn on their flashlights and see a mother and father with their young child huddled into a corner, scared, wide eyed. 
The cops find the family computer and haul it out of the room, they cuff dad, they cuff mom, they take the kid to child services. 
This is just temporary until they have time to check over the computer and find evidence. 
Sawyer’s neighbors are as innocent as anyone. 
Maybe a few illegally downloaded MP3s. 
Maybe a few movies. 
Nothing major. 
Mostly they would used the computer to do their taxes and buy things. 
Make some video calls to their moms and dads. 
They were by all accounts, normal and boring. 
it would be a few weeks before they were back at home and things were restored. 
It would be a few weeks of being stuck in holding, interrogation, pleading their innocence. 
No one thought it was just the quiet guy next door. 
It wasn’t until digital forensics went through their router logs and noticed repeated late night connections from a MAC address that didn’t belong to anyone in the house. 
That’s when they figured out that their WiFi was hacked.
Here’s the funny thing about MAC addresses. 
Every device has one, and each one is unique. 
they have a format that looks like: 20:E5:2A:5E:12:37 the first half will delineate the manufacturer, the second half will identify the make and model. 
The problem is that changing this for most devices is a process that takes at most, a few minutes. 
you can make it so that your router identifies as an iPhone, or your iPhone identifies as smart TV. 
Or you can make up a number as long as it follows the xx:xx:xx:yy:yy:yy format. 
The number set is in hexadecimal you have values ranging from 0-F where F=15. 
This gives us 281,474,976,710,656 possible combinations. 
We’re at a point in history where we’re running out of available addresses, so they’re extended the format. 
The main point of his rabbit trail is two fold. 
A search and a little bit of know how means any device can masquerade as any other device. 
The other thing to keep in mind is there are security measures that require connected devices to have certain MAC addresses. 
The problem is, those addresses are broadcasted to the public. 
Let’s say, for instance, you’re running a private network at your place of business. 
You’ve setup your WiFi to filter out approved MAC addresses, thinking that anyone with an unregistered device won’t be able to get in. 
I’m an attacker, using only my cell phone, I can sweep the radio signal and every device will bounce back with information including the device name, MAC address, IP, and possibly more. 
I then use a bit of software to change my MAC address to one that’s already connected to your network. 
The router sees the same address, says right this way sir, and I’m in. 
If i need the password to the WiFi as well, that will take at most another thirty minutes. 
If i have a laptop, maybe less. 
If i’m a social engineer, it will take a phone call. 
-----
I’m enjoying these tangents of explaining security things. 
It helps me remember how much i know and gets me to research what I don’t. 
they can also be very distracting. 
Sometimes i’ll start looking up something and hours later i’ll be running subnet scans and trying to find vulnerabilities. 
the thrill of the hunt is slow and methodical. 
It’s an interesting time we live in, when we have hackers that are actively working against, working with, and working for the governments of the world. 
There’s hackers that made a legitimate business out of it. 
And many more that made a less than legitimate business. 
In addition to all the old tricks, we now have ransomware, which is truly sinister. 
One wrong click and all of your data, your entire computer is encrypted with someone else's key. 
And the only way to get it back, if you don’t have backups, is to pay up. 
We have ways to put invisible frames into web pages, luring victims to click on things they can’t even see, in turn giving the attacker tokens that allow them to masquerade as the victim. 
It goes so much deeper than just passwords and usernames. 
Looking back at the TalkTalk breach from last month, when a couple of kids managed to leak the user database of a large telecom company. 
And they did it by executing a single command. 
Sometimes, that’s all it takes. 
One single vulnerability. 
One kid with a keyboard that read a tutorial. 
I suppose i should get back to the story. 
I shouldn’t have taken yesterday off. 
that’s always a mistake, especially since i haven’t read anything back.
Trying to recap, Sawyer and Carter have just caught up, Sawyer’s neighbors are in holding. 
The foreigners are a few precious steps away from infiltrating the military industrial complex. 
There’s some military dudes about to bust in and make some noise. 
We should close that loop before getting back to our heros.
-----
Night falls in Romania and three men in stealth combat gear are changing formation as they come up the target building. 
They refer to themselves simple as Alpha, Bravo, and Delta. 
Alpha keeps a mark on the guard by the back door. 
Bravo and Delta go in to cut the power. 
The lights flicker and go out. 
A few seconds later, they kick back on with a dull glow. 
Back up generator. 
Didn’t figure they’d have one. 
This is going to make things a bit more complicated. 
Alpha makes his way to the guard, slow and silent. 
On the hacking floor, everyone stops what they’re doing when the power flickers. 
They stop talking and line up to take a gun from the cabinet on the wall. 
No one says a word. 
Most of them are ex-military. 
And they’ve been over the drills before. 
Always have a backup plan.
Alpha takes out his knife and readies to grab the guard around the neck. 
He lunges and the guard starts to turn. 
His knife misses the neck and slices a line up the guards shoulder. 
The guard sprays bullets in several directions before landing a few in his assailant's leg. 
The guard twists away and begins yelling at Alpha and pointing his gun at him. 
Two bullets come in from the side and take off most of the guards face. 
Delta and Bravo come running in from the darkness. 
Alpha points at his leg. 
They get a medical kit and patch him up, give him a shot of pain killers and enter the backdoor.
The Romanians have split off into three teams. 
one went up, one went down, and one stayed put. 
They heard the report from the guard’s gun and everyone got low and slow and quiet. 
The Americans know this is going to be a cat and mouse game of assault now. 
So much for keeping it quiet. 
They enter the building and there’s a stairwell in either corner that goes up. 
There another one that goes down. 
No elevators. 
No one can hear a sound. 
Delta takes out the cell jammer from his backpack and turns it up high, leaving it under the stairs. 
Bravo takes a long range EMP from his pack and does the same. 
All communication with the outside world from this building has been rendered null. 
From the stairs, one of the hackers pokes his head around the corner. 
He wastes no time and starts shooting. 
He manages to hit Bravo in the shoulder before three large caliber bullets from the Americans put tennis ball sized holes in his chest. 
From the other stairwell two men come running in firing automatic weapons, landing a few shots in Delta’s back. 
the three americans put their backs together weapons drawn, desperate to make a last stand. 
They take out one of their assailants before they’re joined by a guard from the basement, another from the front door. 
The voice comes from behind the men in the stairs, he says in Romanian, “Leave one of them alive, kill the rest.” And before any hope of retaliation Alpha and Bravo are riddled with bullets. 
One of the guards tackles Delta to the ground and breaks his arms. 
He is dragged, bleeding and broken, down to the basement. 
Either way, he’s not coming back from his alive. 
“Take the other two to the incinerator. 
Let’s clean this shit up, we still have work to do. 
You! get the power restored. 
You two! find the sources of the jammers. 
I want this operation back online within the hour.” The remaining men go about their jobs, some a little shaken. 
Most of them have been through this before. 
They get everything up and running three hours later. 
The boss makes a few phone calls and the number of guards doubles. 
He makes a few more and they have a new location ready to go. 
The trucks pull up and everyone takes a field trip to the new building. 
It’s a bunker this time. 
It should last a while longer. 
The wire the place up and less than 24 hours after the attacks they’re more secure than ever.
-----
Alright, that should take care of that for now. 
I’m still a good almost 3k behind in my word count for the day. 
I have to leave to get cigarettes soon. 
I had to kill the Americans. 
I don’t know why. 
Maybe because that whole scene bored me to write it. 
I didn’t enjoy it at all. 
I don’t know anything about writing action sequences. 
Maybe because i haven’t read an action thriller in a long time. 
I’m unfamiliar with the way it’s done. 
Hell, i don’t even know how to describe those things. 
And i know this project is becoming like 80% me ranting and maybe 20% actual story. 
I’m ok with this, kind of. 
Not really. 
but, the point is that i get back in the habit of writing something. 
If i want to yell with my fingers for a while, that’s fine. 
that’s my problem. 
I’m not doing this for anyone else. 
We can work on the discipline of actually writing a whole story next time. 
For now, i need to focus on the act. 
Just forcing myself to do it. 
Thanksgiving is next week and that’s a whole set of problems right there. 
It’s going to throw a wrench in the works. 
Or at least it’s going to force me to not sleep much when i’m down there. 
If i can manage to get ahead in the next few days, then I’ll feel better about it. 
I’m coming up to the two thirds mark. 
and that’s something to celebrate. 
And by Celebrate i mean plow up to 35k. 
Just two thousand more words to go. 
That’s two hours of continuous work. 
you can do that. 
you can sacrifice that much time to get there. 
I shouldn’t waste so much of it writing about writing about it. 
part of me wants to cut off from the main story and write some short story that has nothing to do with anything else. 
I could. 
I might do that too. 
Think of it like an exercise. 
Another hundred words or so and i’ve got to go get cigarettes before i forget and the shop closes. 
Even though that’s in a few hours, i’d rather get it done now. 
Or like eighty words from now. 
I’m wondering if i’m going to run out of things to talk about. 
I can never talk this much vocally. 
Not unless there’s drugs or alcohol involved. 
And even then it’s just drugged and drunk rambling. 
I suppose writing is like that too, except the writing only gets to hear their side of things. 
Reading is interesting in that sense, because it’s like listening to someone go on about something but you can’t interrupt and ask questions. 
You’re just along for the ride.
-----
“So what’s your endgame? What’s your plan? you can’t just bus tables and pay your rent and pretend that it’s enough for you. 
Don’t you want, i don’t know, more?” Carter and Sawyer have been smoking and drinking tall cans of beer down by the docks. 
It’s early in the morning. 
Like, four or so. 
Carter’s sedan is parked down the street. 
It’s a nice car. 
He’s wearing a nice casual suit. 
It’s more than Sawyer could ever think about affording. 
Sawyer is looking up at the foggy night sky and thinking about all of those things. 
Funny that. 
He’s been running for ten years, his life is going nowhere. 
He’s been content with very little. 
His old friend did some time, had everything taken from him, now he’s running a company, he’s doing well for himself. 
He exhales, long and slow, looking out over the water.
“I haven’t given a lot of thought to that. 
There’s been a van parked outside my apartment for the last few days. 
I actually, wasn’t planning on going home tonight. 
Something wasn’t sitting right, you know?” Carter nodded. 
“I was actually going to get out of town. 
I don’t really know what i was going to do. 
I’m getting tired of running. 
Just when i started to feel settled in. 
At this point, i’m so used to leaving town that it’s just a bummer. 
I don’t like it, but i’ve taken it was a matter of course.” Sawyer takes a long drink of beer.
“One of the many reasons i wanted to catch up with you is offer you a spot. 
I’m in need of an engineer right now, someone that knows what you know. 
There’s a lot of money in our old hobby these days, and my company is getting overloaded with work requests. 
I need someone to head up a team. 
It’ll be like the old days, except you’ll be making money. 
We’d be making money. 
And it’s legit. 
You won’t have to worry about the feds anymore.”
“Well shit. 
I don’t know how i can pass that up. 
Where do I sign? Do i have to move? I don’t really care. 
I’m not tied to this job or my apartment.”
“Glad to hear it. 
And yeah, I’d move. 
We’re in the city and getting to the office is going to be necessary. 
Due to the nature of our work, we can’t do a lot of it from home. 
It, uh, violates a few breaches of contract, and probably some laws.”
“I see..”
Carter reaches into his pocket and pushes a button on his phone. 
He finishes his beer and crushes the can. 
He puts out his cigarette when the first car shows up. 
It doesn’t have any lights. 
It’s the same kind of eerie black that the van was. 
Sawyer turns around and has a look of panic on his face. 
That’s when the second and third cars show up.
“What the hell is going on?” sawyer’s voice is full of panic at this point.
“Oh calm down. 
I’m surprised it took you this long. 
I told you I made a deal to get out of the joint.”
“Goddamnit! No! NOO!” An officer of the law, without a badge, with a gun approaches flanked by two more.
“Timothy Sawyer! You are under arrest for violation of the computer fraud and abuse act! Keep your hands up and don’t move.” He grabs Sawyer and and turns him around, he puts a zip tie around his wrists. 
“You have the right to remain silent. 
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.”
“Don’t look so mad, old friend. 
You should have seen this coming. 
A high profile case like yours couldn’t go on forever. 
They wanted to bring you in for years. 
Finding you was difficult. 
But you slipped up, everyone slips sooner or later.”
“You bastard! I trusted you!”
“Why? why on earth would you trust me. 
I rotted away in jail! You trusted me because you knew me once, ten years ago. 
You shouldn’t have trusted me then either. 
How the hell did it take them so long to find you? They almost did, you know, back in Reno. 
They were two days behind your ass. 
Then the bus crash happened and that really threw a wrench in everything. 
They thought you were dead. 
When they brought me and my team on the case I knew you were still alive. 
Your signature is still easy to find if you know where to look.”
“Go to hell!” Sawyer said as they pushed him in the back seat of the black car.
A federal agent walks over to Carter. 
“Nice work, as usual. 
This should put you in the clear.”
“And you’ll get my record sorted out?”
“I won’t, but someone will. 
We’ll be in touch.”
“Yeah, i’m sure.” Carter lights another cigarette and walks down the street to his car. 
Three black cars escort Sawyer to a very common looking office building downtown. 
They drive into the basement parking garage and haul him in. 
They take the elevator down three stories. 
They take Sawyer into an interrogation room. 
They let him stay in there for hours before anyone comes to talk to him. 
He’s nervous, he’s scared, he doesn’t want to go to prison.
The door opens and in walks a middle aged man in a grey suit. 
He has a folder on him that’s several inches thick. 
He tosses it down in front of Sawyer. 
He walks behind him and pulls out a knife. 
Carefully, he slips the knife under Sawyer’s wrist and cuts the zip tie.
“Son, do you know what that is?”
“Let me guess,” He says, rubbing his red marked wrists, “It’s my permanent record.”
“Funny. 
They didn’t tell me you were funny. 
I don’t think that was in your file.” The man opens the folder and the inside is lists and lists and incident reports. 
“This is a folder of what we think you might have been involved with. 
It’s quite impressive. 
I haven’t seen a file like this in a while. 
We don’t get many in at your rank. 
You can imagine, i’m sure, what it takes to bring in someone such as yourself. 
Most of the higher profile cases like yours are, well, out of the country, and technically, not in our jurisdiction.”
“Ok, so you have a file on me. 
That’s great. 
What are we doing here? Why am I here, shouldn’t i been in jail, a police station, something like that?”
“Maybe if we caught you when we should have caught you. 
That’s how we used to handle these things. 
Not anymore. 
Times have changed, we have a different president. 
And he’s made it very clear that we’re not to destroy our precious natural resources. 
Unless they don’t’ cooperate, of course. 
That would be a different story.
“I want to get to the point, because that would be best for everyone. 
Don’t you agree?”
He doesn’t wait for acknowledgement, “Excellent. 
I don’t know if you follow the news, but i can tell you that it’s always a lot worse than what’s reported. 
We’re recruiting counter-cyber terrorist agents. 
And people in your position aren’t in much of a… position...to uh, refuse.” Sawyer looks at the man in the interrogation room questionably. 
He wasn’t sure where he was going after he used the same word twice in that sentence. 
It really threw everyone off track.
“So you want to give me a job?”
“Well, kind of. 
We can’t afford to pay you. 
I mean, we could, but we’re not going to. 
Instead, if you help us, we’ll help you. 
Just like your friend back there. 
He helped us out, and now he’s mostly a free man. 
You just have to be aware of something. 
We could call on you at anytime. 
Any time we call you have to answer and be ready to serve your country. 
These are matters of national security. 
It’s either that, or we throw you in jail for, I don’t know, as long as we feel like it? I think we can do that. 
We’ve pretty much got the OK to do damn near anything in the name of national security. 
Also, your rap sheet is pretty extensive, that’ll add up to a lot of time, probably most of it in solitary.” He stops long enough to let it all sink in. 
“It’s a yes or no situation for you.”
“I’m going with yes on this. 
Fine. 
I’ll be your monkey.”
“glad to hear it. 
Someone will be in to escort you to your quarters. 
We appreciate your cooperation.”
“whatever,” sawyer says, echoing the war cry of his generation.

You like that? a little betrayal? that’ll get the blood pumping. 
I hope so. 
I wasn’t expecting to do that. 
But i didn’t know what else to do. 
it would have just been boring if he got the job with his old friend and everything was going well. 
But a plot twist leads to an attempt to tie the two storylines together. 
Hopefully that works out. 
I don’t know how else to reconcile the two threads. 
This opens up the the possibility of actually ending the story around 50k which would be good. 
I’m not planning on keeping this story going after the month. 
I’ll go through and pull out what i like, but that’s all. 
this is just an exercise this year. 
I’ve been slacking on the writing for so long. 
it feels good to get back in the habit of forcing myself to do something. 
And its giving me a place to put all my thoughts. 
that’s worth it to me. 
that alone is enough to make all this worth it. 
I’m trying to put it all into perspective and keep my motivation up. 
By not lying to myself. 
While hitting word count is the most important thing for me, keeping in check how i get there is also important. 
I’m just a guy trying to get to a goal. 
nothing more.
-----
I did it again and went another day without even trying to get something down. 
Social obligations and oh shit i have to email my mom. 
and that’s taken care of. 
going home for the holidays is going to take a chunk of time out of my writing. 
And i need to move this off line for those few days. 
When i return i’ll have about two days to wrap this monster up. 
that’s four days to really crank out 15k. 
Woof. 
in that light tonight i have to get as far as possible. 
and i’m home alone for the moment and have some nice jazz music and a bit of tea to keep it going. 
TOmorrow i have to make a trip to the hospital, but i’m planning on lugging the laptop along to get something done during the excursion. 
So much to do and my faith in this story isn’t all that high. 
Part of me just wants to get it over with. 
The golden ratio point, when it good writing you hit ‘em with everything you’ve got. 
In my writing, you struggle to do anything because you’re not even sure what’s happening or why and part of you just want to go to the president and have him push the red button and end of story, no one wins, no great victory. 
Nothing. 
Just like life. 
A big push in the beginning, a lousy middle section, and an end that leaves you with nothing. 
A cautionary tale, Aesop’s fable for the modern age. 
A predictable pile of trash. 
There’s no heros in this story. 
I’m not sure anyone really has any redeaming qualities. 
There’s no attachment to anyone, they seem thin and disposible. 
I’m writing in 2D. 
but at least i’m writing SOMETHING. 
that’s what i’m trying to remind myself. 
It’s getting to the point where i’m spending more time writing about writing because the actually writing strikes me as trite and dull. 
I don’t feel like the reader could possibly be invested in anything i’ve written here. 
But as they say, the first 10000 or so words are all trash. 
The first notebook should just be thrown out. 
Don’t try to turn it into more than it is. 
Just leave the trash in the trash and move on. 
I’m going to re read this pile next month and trim it up and make some basic edits, but other than that… well, it can all just go hell. 
Maybe i’ll go back to writing pointless bar narratives about going nowhere 30 somethings and barflys and pretty bartenders and the futility of it all. 
Or day in the life melodramas. 
Stories beyond that scope tend to be out of my reach. 
I’m not capable of writing another Westworld, Illuminatus!, or On the Road. 
I’ve been called a wannabe bukowski before, and i’m not sure if i like it, but it’s not inaccurate. 
Easily said in my 20s. 
Now in my 30s, it’s not much different. 
The idealism is gone. 
I’m not single anymore, so the wandering the streets of the city in a drugged and drunken stupor rambling narrative would only be pieced together from flashes of what might be memory, but it’s been too long to really remember if it happened to me at all. 
I don’t feel like i’m trying to be someone else in my writing most of the time. 
Sure, this whole story is forced and probably comes off that way. 
But that was kind of the point. 
i wanted to write something about disgust from the point of view of a disgusting person as well. 
The story would just be following a real lowest common denominator type that’s slumming it and treating people badly while ranting about how everything makes them sick. 
I’ve touched on it before, but maybe i really want to explore that deeper. 
Being the in the city has a way of bringing that out of me. 
what once was the glittering gold lined streets of San Francisco turns into a shit stained sidewalk, littered with used needles, crackheads and meth addicts, tech kids that took the fast track with mom and dad’s money to write the next big app, stepping over bums that used to be able to afford a house here, making their way from the new beer garden to the new hot restaurant, to the new luxury condo. 
doing their new lines of blow and banging their new tinder date on the balcony. 
There was a time i found all of that facinating and just a weird part of life and now i don’t feel so good about any of it. 
Maybe i need a return to the woods for a while. 
Maybe in december i’ll spend a lot of time in the park feeding squirrels and sitting in silence. 
That might be a damn good idea. 
I don’t even want to go back to writing this story right now, i mostly want to get some thoughts down that have been troubling. 
think of it as a therapy session, where the unwilling reader is given a well trimmed beard and a pair of spectacles and a note pad. 
i’m just going to lie back on the couch for a while and stare at the ceiling and talk about whatever. 
Your usual rates may apply.
I managed to wake up around 7 this morning, only to take a nap at 2 and wake again at 8:30. 
I had a good hangover going, would have been the perfect time to write for a few hours. 
BUt that’s passed and i missed the opportunity. 
I had to pass the radio station over to some Tom Waits stuff, even if the words in songs can throw me off sometimes, i needed to go somewhere a little more morose. 
I think the depression has been sitting around my room, hanging out on the couch with me. 
Telling me to do things like go out and head to bar down the street. 
Telling me to take another break. 
wait for inspiration to hit me upside the head. 
I don’t think it works that way anymore. 
I think it’s better to keep hammering away, free write or just rant and ramble until something hits you. 
When i was working in kitchens, i’d have these flashes of inspiration and never could get to a piece of paper soon enough to remember anything. 
Sure, most of it was probably throw away. 
But just having that notebook in my back pocket like i used to. 
If i’m to continue writing these things, that’s going to have to be a thing again. 
if something occurs to me, write it down. 
I should be turning to the piano if i need a brain break. 
Don’t let it rest, it does that all the time. 
Now it’s just lazy and looking for excuses not to do anything. 
Put on a movie, go get drunk, take a nap. 
Wake up tomorrow when you’re fresh and ready to go. 
I haven’t been fresh and ready to go in twenty years. 
I just wake up feeling more tired every day no matter how much or little sleep i get. 
The rest of the time is spent laying in bed tossing and turning, sweating and kicking the cats off my legs. 
How easy their life is, but how limited. 
stuck inside, sleeping all the time, eating, shiting, must be kinda nice. 
But i don’t think i could have a whole life like that. 
I would be too restless. 
I’d be the cat that waits by the door, eager to escape. 
Or the caged bird that never shuts up. 
If you’re gona lock me up, i’m gonna be loud about it.

blacking out in three two one down one to go and throw it away the baby in the bath water and the walter where are you you song of a bitch i’ll get you you bastard and faster we go and trip and fall and flurry and falter because walter is wrong all the time and worry wort wert and ramble and please stop talking to me i’m just trying to get something down and doesn’t anyone understand that and doesn’t anyone know what it’s like to just try and get something down and done and have a thing to go look i made this but don’t look too close because there’s blood stains and seman stains and the words are all wrong. 
And don’t look at it too close because i didn’t really mean for anyone to see it, but i just wanted you to know that i made a thing and that’s cool. 
And that’s all the sense of accomplishment i ever wanted.
The fat man will tell you everything because he’s shoveling shit up his nose and noise is all he knows. 
His shoes are falling apart on his feet, but barely, his pants are loose like a pirates wrapped in a rope belt so you can hang yourself with it, if push comes to shove and worse comes to worst. 
The wurst thing you can do, well i never sausage a thing like that in my life.

I don’t know where that was going but damn do i love eggs. 
I want to take a bath but there’s a draught, a draft, a drout, a doubt and trout fishing in america changed my life, for better or worse or till death do us part we’ll never know and knowing is half the battle and war never changes. 
If the other half of the battle is rambing John cotton feild and we all get in the truck at the end of the day with our chains a rattling and foreman takes the picks and the shovels and we could take him if we wanted to. 
we could jump him and get the keys and make our escape and run like hell because running is all we know and we don’t know much except the desire for sweet freedom and range and home to put on it, but nowhere to stay and nothing to say except, i’m sorry. 
My life is an apology and aposthrophe an apostolic, alcoholic, alchemical all state tri city subterreanian trainwreck. 
I’m sorry, i’m so sorry, don’t worry, don’t cry for me artisinal cheese shop workers of america. 
Chedder, i hardly know her. 
You chedder, you brought her here. 
Well, either way, we’re going to have to find a way to bury the body so come with me, i know a good creek.Not far from here. 
Here take this shovel, let me find the bone saw. 
See? that wasn’t so bad. 
The blood will come out, or we can just ditch the clothes and go swimming. 
This swamp isn’t big enough for the two of us to chew with us and breaking bread and loafing around because we’ve gotten crusted any way you slice it, it’s still pretty crumby. 
You were always an against the grain kinda guy, but is going gluten free really the answer. 
Maybe their are no answers, maybe this is all one big misunderstanding and sandy hook and hurricane sandy and a cool shandy on a hot day were just myths. 
and maybe mythology is more important than the reality. 
it’s all reflective, don’t you see. 
I’d hold a mirror up to things but i’m too caught up in the fascination of my own reflection to bother. 
I’m too caught up in my own hang ups to hang out. 
I’m caught. 
I’m too. 
i’m very. 
variables. 
integers, strings and sing a song of sick pants, bro.
In a parallel universe tom waits and thom york are yodeling salesman that go door to door selling whatever they think is cool. 
In a pair of el universidades, someone is going to school. 
possible several people. 
They will rise up the ranks and be great scientists and until we be the scientists in the white house and the mayor's office and the city halls and have people making and enforcing laws that have a background is something besides making laws and enforcing them, until then we’ll be stuck in a loop of getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing and no one can break the mold and the mild sense of dread that comes with it all. 
We’re never going to get anywhere because no one thought enough ahead to bring a gas can and it wouldn’t matter anyway, we’d just end up drinking it because the label was wrong and said prune juice and i was too full of shit and and and and and.

You can’t stuff the excrement back inside you. 
All you can do is try to clean yourself off. 
What a sham. 
what a scam and wow buddy. 
thanks for listening. 
this has been broadcast of whatever man. 
don’t worry about it. 
it’s cool. 
stay calm. 
keep calm and bury the hatchet. 
The old battle axe and now my stomach is upset and i don’t know what i said, but i do know that if i wasn’t backspacing some damn much i’d be in a better place by now and that might help me sleep at night but i doubt it. 
the only thing that helps me sleep are drugs. 
Like i told my old coworkers, shot of bourbon, shot of nyquil, fat rip on a bowl of weed and count backwards from 10 and boom, out like a light. 
like the street light i used to pop the bb gun i got for christmas and the guy from the city came out to fix it and found me and told me to knock that shit off.
Or when i was a kid and found out i could short out the lightbulbs by spraying them with water on the top and they would fizzle out. 
And my parents would get mad because the light bulbs kept dying and no one knew why and i was more fascinated with how something like a spray bottle could turn out the lights. 
It came with the desire to dismantle things. 
Anything, really. 
lego syndrome. 
I’ve always been curious about putting things together and pulling them apart and wondering how they work but now i’m getting older and my brain is slower and most of it doesn't have the same charm, it’s not as interesting, or new to me. 
I’d like to be one of those people that has a workbench in their garage and makes things out of wood or builds robots. 
knows how to solder things together and write simple programs to do things like turn the lights off by sending a text message, or something like that.
I’ve had this blister on my left index finger for the last two days and it’s getting impossible not to fiddle with it. 
it’s right next to my thumb and my thumb just wants to push on it all the time and watch how the pus underneath pushes the skin around, trying to get free. 
And Sawyer is sitting around like, hey boss, so you left me in this basement under a kind of house arrest slash government contract situation. 
you gonna get around to that? Or am i just gonna sit here. 
It’s cool. 
it’s not like i was that interesting anyway.
and Mr. 
President is passed out on his desk in the oval office in a pile of morphine and coke and spilled brandy. 
I just imagine that’s what presidents drink. 
old brandy. 
maybe because of the el presidente brand of brandy. 
that might have something to do with it. 
He’s really upset that operation shut it down ended with a whimper. 
he doesn't like it when things end with a whimper. 
he likes it when they end in a bang and zoom and kablooie. 
He likes telling the military to go for it, man. 
Send some people in, level it out. 
Turn the dessert into glass. 
Turn the forest into a parking lot. 
Sometimes i wonder if that isn’t the best course of action. 
I’m not sure, i’m no expert. 
my hippy dippy leanings of reform and nonviolence haven’t always gotten things done. 
Then again, the violence and whatnot seem to just perpetuate the problem. 
I’m not really a problem solver. 
Like Barbara Kingsolver and her poisonwood bible. 
barbara bar bar barbar barbarians. 
so named, according to a history nerd friend of mine because the romans thought they were say bar bar, all the time. 
we name things the way we hear them. 
Sometimes it sticks. 
A turn of phrase, a toss of the coin. 
And at the end of it all, we have a story to tell. 
The wacky tale of language and how it got here. 
How we got here with all these words. 
So many words and we don’t know the half of them. 
We’re a bunch of dummies. 
that’s my grand conclusion. 
I should have saved that for the end. 
The big finale. 
the wow finish.
38000
I’m going into the last fifth of the story soon. 
12000 words to go and after the first 38k that doesn’t seem like too much. 
I could crank it all out by the weekend if i really tried. 
But really trying is getting more difficult, hence the last few pages of nothing. 
Nothing at all of value. 
But whatever, i’m not going to pretend that there’s any value to what i’ve been writing anyway. 
Like i keep reminding myself, that’s not the point. 
Don’t get attached to it. 
Be ok with ruining everyone’s lives. 
There’s not even that many characters. 
Maybe i should write something about one of the rouge counter terrorism hacker cells in america. 
i didn’t write anything about the chinese either. 
they’re rather big players. 
or Russia. 
i wanted to keep it a bit simpler. 
but that’s also kind of limiting. 
and limits are good for forcing creativity. 
Still, creativity hasn’t really been my strongest trait here. 
I’m not trying to reinvent any wheels. 
I’m just trying to get something done. 
Every year i tell myself i’m going to do this and i’m going to finish this mad project. 
But this year was the first in a long time that it really feels like something i can finish, to a degree. 
Hopefully, not like last time i finished and the story was somewhere near half way but i hit the word goal and then got stuck in editing. 
and that never ended and the story wasn’t even finished at all. 
i guess the trick is to finish the story first. 
then edit. 
then rewrite. 
draft 0 is a good way to think about it. 
null draft. 
it’s doesn’t even count, really. 
it’s like an extended outline of gibberish. 
maybe something can be pieced out of it. 
Maybe not. 
but i’m not really counting on it. 
Maybe i’ll be able to wrap up the story before 50k then just write some shorts to round out my word count. 
in actuality, i’ll probably just rant a lot anyway. 
so whatever. 
this has been a good two thousand word warm up.
------
“Mr. 
President!” The voice of his aide was in the door again and Mr. 
President’s face was covered in crushed morphine pill dust. 
His glass of brandy had spilled, mixing with the pill dust and turning into a very expensive, muddy adhesive. 
He shot up from the desk, blinking and disoriented. 
Wondering why this person was yelling at him. 
His wife and kids and the family dog had been taken to their safe house slash summer get away. 
There had been threats against the white house, normally, he’d be operating in the bunker. 
He thought it best to get blasted on pain meds and have the red phone nearby. 
He thought he needed to clear his head by soaking it in old liquor and narcotics. 
His aide came in and gave him a rag to wipe his face off. 
The aide made a motion to start cleaning up the mess of the desk when the president stopped him.
“Get a glass, uhh what’s your name?”
“Thompson, sir.”
“Thompson, get a glass, have a seat.”
The aide, now named Thompson took a crystal glass from the drink cart in the corner.
“And bring over that bottle or brown stuff.”
There were three on the cart, Thompson made a gesture to the president to indicate which one he should be grabbing. 
Mr. 
President wasn’t paying attention.
“Sir, is there a particular bottle you’d like?”
“OH shit, it doesn’t matter, it’s all the same once it gets in the blood. 
It’s all old and oaky, none of us are going to tell the difference.”
The aide was a little taken aback by the most powerful man in the world and his candid attitude. 
He pick one of the crystal decanters half full of brown liquor and brought it over to the desk.
“excellent choice,” the president said with a he didn’t really care but was glad that there was a bottle present again at the table look on his face. 
“Thompson, give me your glass.” The president took the glasses and pour each of them a solid three fingers of whatever it was. 
he scraped up some of the morphine mud off the desk and mixed it in to the liquor, using a silver letter opener as a spoon. 
He gave the cloudy glass to Thompson, who looked at it questionably. 
“To your health.” said the president, clinking glasses with a reluctant aide. 
But when the president invites in you in for a drink laced with narcotics, you’re not really in a position to say no. 
that would be rude. 
We can’t have that kind of rude behaviour happening in the oval office.
The aide, known as Thompson, managed to choke down a healthy gulp of the cloudy brown liquor before coughing. 
His body was shuddering and his blood was very confused about the sudden influx of new chemicals. 
the morphine was going fisticuffs with the adderall and stimulants he took on a regular basis to keep up with the odd schedule of white house work. 
Long hours, no real time zone. 
He was lucky he didn’t have a wife and kids, The President said. 
You often have to choose between your work and them. 
And often they can seem weak and needy. 
It’s difficult to maintain a real relationship with anyone under the circumstances of professional political work at a high level. 
You don’t have time to babysit the kids, or listen to whatever it is your wife wants to complain about THAT day. 
You don’t have time to just sit around and watch the game.
Thompson is listening and looking at the pile of crushed drug mud and the glasses with booze older than his father and the glasses and booze are probably worth more than what he takes home in a year. 
And this man that’s ranting to him about not having time while he’s been passed out in a stupor in his office most of the day.
“For christ’s sake, i didn’t invite you in here to have a drink just to listen to myself talk.”
“I’m sorry, sir, i didn’t mean to…”
“Yes yes, whatever,” The president takes another gulp of his concoction. 
Thompson follows suite. 
“Can we drop the formalities. 
Maybe i just want to take a break from hearing about people i’ve sent off to die and their grieving widows. 
Maybe i just want to sit around and bullshit with someone for a while. 
Do you have a dog at home?”
“No, sir, I’ve been thinking about getting a cat.”
“Well, to each his own. 
I suppose you’re not home enough to own a dog. 
No matter. 
My dogs have brought me much comfort and joy over the years. 
I highly recommend it. 
It gives you something to look forward to at the end of the day.”
“Yes, sir.” Thompson says it like a very young man listening to much older man give him life advice, which isn’t too far off from the truth.
“You see Thompson,” He pauses to take another gulp of his drink. 
Thompson does the same and is starting to feel it. 
“I’m responsible for a great many lives. 
Sometimes i make the right call, and lives are saved. 
Sometimes, people die because of me. 
Sometimes it’s ok, because they were bad people and they needed to die so that people that weren’t as bad don’t have to die. 
Something like that. 
I don’t know why i’m telling you this, but i sent three good men to their deaths the other day. 
It’s really not sitting with me well. 
I want to bomb the tar out of the people that killed them. 
But i’m told that i can’t do that. 
and that the repercussions would be disastrous.” He says the last part while waving his hands around in a kind of oh whatever eye rolling gesture. 
“I say, fuck ‘em. 
let ‘em burn. 
It doesn’t weigh on my conscious any more when they deserve it.” Mr. 
President throws back the last of his drink and motions for Thompson to hand him his glass. 
Thompson finishes his drink and the president mixes another round. 
He’s getting a little wobbly. 
His basic motor functions are present enough that he pours the liquor and throws some of the morphine sludge in and stirs them up with the silver letter opener. 
He slides Thompson the glass and they clink them together and take a healthy sip each.
“you’re a good kid, Thompson. 
thanks for coming in to see me.” The aide is thinking about why he came into this office in the first place. 
he’s a little fuzzy on if he was sent here to get the president or if he was called in. 
Wasn’t there something he was supposed to get him for? It was a little late now, they were both a little less than presentable. 
Looking a little less than presidential.
“You like baseball? National pastime, i can get tickets to anything. 
Perks of the job, i suppose. 
We should go to a game together. 
What are you doing next week?”
“Nothing, sir.” Thompson is a little cock-eyed.
“Great. 
I’ll have someone arrange everything. 
Whatever, i’m the fucking President of the United States. 
It’ll be great.” The most powerful man in the world takes another long gulp of his concoction, puts the glass down and blinks a few dozen times. 
“Now, if you’ll excuse me, Thompson. 
I’ve got some work to do.” The president closes his eyes and promptly starts snoring.
Thompson finishes his drink and puts the bottle back on the drink tray. 
He using a very nice napkin to wipe his glass clean and wrap it up in his pocket. 
he wants something to remember this by. 
having a crystal glass with the great seal on them was as good a memento as anything.
-----
The most fantastic thing that happened, what was the thing. 
I didn't download a copy of the work i've done so far. 
Meaning, I have nothing to go one while i'm at my parents house for thanksgiving. 
Meaning! I'm flying blind again with a blank page staring at me and it's mocking me and i'm at the table I grew up eating breakfast at, which is strange because I don't think i've written anything here (ever?) at least since high school but probably earlier. 
That doesn't matter. 
What does matter is that I have a chance to write something because I decided to waste the last 24 hours by sleeping. 
I get it when Hemm said to write while you're hungry. 
It makes sense. 
Digestion slows everything down and sometimes puts you right to sleep because it's such a strenuous process. 
Write while you're hungry. 
Write while drunk and hungry. 
Edit sober. 
Never eat again. 
That seems to be the key. 
Just never eat anything. 
That's fine. 
Cigarettes and booze it is. 
Oh how young I feel. 
Getting drunk on Mom's tequila. 
Sitting around the kitchen table. 
Icons and family pictures everywhere. 
Is there a guide for mothers on decorating the house after the kids have moved out? Does it include kitschy everything, photos of the kids, photos of other people's kids. 
Cut outs of old Far Side comics (might be my dad's doing), Tiles with prints on them, I can see one from where i'm sitting, it has a cow on it, it's captioned, eat chicken.
Remembering where i'm at in the story is a tricky business. 
Last thing I remember writing was about the president and his aide getting wasted and talking it out. 
The leaves Sawyer in work/custody, Carter free and out there, Romania in the bunker, almost ready to strike on to phase two. 
Whatever that might be. 
I think that's everyone. 
I didn't do a lot of characters on this story. 
A few that kind of popped in at the time and have since gone away forever. 
Kind of a new tactic for me. 
Not used to that one. 
Usually, everything is a multi threaded mismash and everyone is everywhere and that's that. 
I tried to weave them all together but it usually came off as a bunch of different stories that had nothing to do with each other. 
Which is kind of ok, if you like those 'here is a world and a bunch of different scenes with a bunch of different people in them kind of things. 
Like that movie, Love, Actually. 
Had like 12 threads. 
Each one would dip in and out and culminated around christmas with conclusions a plenty. 
Conflicts all over the place. 
But you had all these different versions of what love was actually supposed to be. 
It was cute. 
A real tear jerking movie, if you're empathic. 
Kind of, oh here we go again all over, if you're not. 
No judgements here. 
Just trying to remember it for whatever it was. 
Anyway, I didn't want to write something like that. 
So I have a main character, and I tried to set up a conflict in the background. 
That was sort of my thought process, if I had one at all. 
I wanted to set up some kind of conflict for the main guy to get into at some point. 
In the process of doing that, I wanted to set up some micro conflicts, maybe some of them turn into something bigger. 
I don't really know. 
I'm not really following whatever it is i'm doing. 
At this point i'm talking about doing it more than doing it. 
I guess i'm a metaphor for everyone i've ever talked to. 
And my metaphor I mean i'm one of them. 
I'm just writing it down instead of slurring it at you while you're bobbing your head around, looking for ANYONE ELSE YOU MIGHT KNOW at this STUPID PARTY. 
That's seem a pretty accurate description of my writing. 
I once described my favorite musician's last album as 'Most of the songs feel like you're slow dancing with someone that would much rather be dancing with someone else.' And I really love that. 
I think that feeling has followed me around my whole life. 
Along with the afore stated being at a party metaphor. 
I don't know if I like the metaphor as much as I like the accents I put on it. 
The emphasis is really special to me. 
It speaks volumes. 
I don't really care if I just dance around the story at this point. 
I mention and acknowledge it's existence, but i'm refusing to participate. 
It reminds me of physical education in high school. 
I knew it was happening and on what days. 
But I never brought my uniform since they made the rule that you couldn't play if you didn't bring it. 
What a great loophole, I thought. 
And who fucking is ever going to care about my attendance at P.E. 
In my last year of high school is spotty.
I'm betting my batting average at this point is 70/30 of commentary vs. 
actual story. 
I don't really have a problem with that since with every word I write i'm reinforcing the ratio and pushing further on the commentary side of it. 
I've gone a bit meta with commenting on the comments i've been making about a story that I really don't care about. 
I don't really know what's left to do with the story. 
I kind of want to kill everyone in it. 
Just have everything go so wrong that I end up writing death scenes for everyone all week. 
Ten Thousand Words of people dying. 
How's that for a conclusion. 
My god right now is a word counter. 
From his position high above me, overlooking this whole business, he's like oh you're almost on target for hitting your daily goal. 
By which he means half way. 
If that included what I didn't and should have wrote yesterday. 
Which I didn't. 
I slept all day. 
That was a mistake. 
I shouldn't have eaten anything and then gotten sleepy and then went to sleep. 
I should have stayed awake, never eaten, drank more, wrote more and got it done. 
This month is about winners. 
And that's how winners work. 
Sit down, shut up and do it. 
Hammer it out, tell everyone to fuck off and get it done. 
Just like my father used to tell me about house chores. 
Do it like you want to get it done. 
And I want to get this done because the first several hundred thousand words you write are going to be garbage. 
And i'm making peace with that. 
I'm in an effort to crank out that huge pile of shit before I can shine. 
I never meant for anyone to read this. 
And if you do read this, i'm so very sorry. 
That was a mistake. 
This was a mistake. 
And i'm sorry about all of that.
When I lose steam ranting and writing about writing the story, I guess it's time to go back to the actually story. 
Whatever. 
I don't have to but I should, which is a defeated punk rock way of looking at things. 
I don't have to do this! But, yeah, I guess I should get it out of the way.
----
The accommodations weren't even that bad. 
That surprised Sawyer a lot. 
He was thinking he'd be in some kind of concentration camp situation. 
Or some kind of cube farm with other people like him that got caught. 
He figured that there'd at least be someone to talk to. 
But no, he was basically left alone. 
They gave him a console set up and a cot. 
They slid meals under the door. 
He had a place to shit and piss, a place to sleep and a place to work. 
And he was under surveillance the whole time. 
He didn't care. 
He would spend most of his time on the console. 
It didn't take him long to get an environment set up. 
A place he liked to write code, to poke holes in things. 
He started working immediately. 
Something snapped in his mind as soon as Cut flipped his switch. 
Soon as he was finally caught. 
That piece of his mind that was so concerned about not getting caught shifted. 
Time to try something else. 
And with that state of mind, having been spurred, having been on the run for so long, having the last person in the world that he had an actual relationship with turn him in. 
The last person he remembered trusting. 
The last person he'd looked in the eyes. 
Now that was all gone. 
Now he was alone in this basement. 
He had a console that was basically a virtual machine. 
Meaning that He could cloud store things, closely monitored. 
But when ever he went to sleep the powers that be would wipe the machine clean, and he'd start fresh. 
He could write code and save that to the cloud storage they gave him. 
But any local changes were null. 
It was like having to set up from scratch every day. 
And that's what he would do. 
He wrote scripts to do this for him as soon as he figured out what was going on. 
He put those on the cloud, and the powers let him keep those, they allowed him work more. 
That was ok. 
They had a monitor on his internet access. 
They could see everything going over their wire. 
He tried some encryption tricks to see if there was persistence. 
He wanted to know his limits before he would commit the code he wanted to write right now. 
He had to know that no one watching him could understand just what was really going on.
They knew that it wouldn't take him long to figure out how the whole system worked. 
And sure there was a few steps that were just to test how good he really was. 
Just to make sure they really had the right guy. 
You could never be sure with these hacker guys. 
When you asked them to turn in their friends, it was always hit or miss. 
Sometimes they didn't care at all. 
They'd change their tune and point at anyone to get themselves out the situation. 
Anything to get themselves out. 
They didn't count on Sawyer being smarter than them. 
The arrogance threw them off. 
Just because they were watching didn't mean that they understood. 
And he found a way to encrypt his notes. 
He found a way to get past the watchful eyes. 
He found a way to work, and continue his work. 
That they were counting on. 
But his work was fragmented. 
No one could get an idea of his big picture. 
He started from scratch every day. 
At the end of every day he made a little progress.
They told him that he had a target. 
They told him that we know this much. 
We know there were hackers in Romania that had gotten this far. 
He could stop them. 
He could null their work with a few days worth of keystrokes. 
That wasn't hard for him. 
With Sawyer on their side, the cat in this cat and mouse game had weapons. 
He could defend himself. 
He could block and keep the cat at bay.
-----
Deep in the heart of Romania, in a bunker in the forest with nothing but an old dirt road used by the fire service that could connect them to the outside world, everyone involved was getting frustrated. 
They had cracked the password file. 
They'd tried them all. 
Nothing was working. 
It was like 6 months of work had just been thrown out. 
All because Sawyer changed the password policy, the encryption method used by those services, beefed up the firewall. 
But he left a backdoor for them. 
The easiest way to keep track of your enemy in this situation was to give them the way inside. 
There were some suspicions around their camp. 
And the team split in half. 
Half working on the back door Sawyer had left for them, the other half looking for a new way in. 
The two fold attack method was the best plan of action. 
The problem was they weren't counting on a hacker on the other end. 
The didn't know they were up against something more than the usual government drones. 
The counter attacks were getting smarter and that was troublesome. 
But the array of targets was broad enough that they could pick a different point of entry. 
And start over from there. 
The starting over at the roadblocks was hitting morale. 
The attitude at the bunker was getting lower every day. 
Sawyer was blinded by revenge, by working alone. 
By always being alone. 
He didn't care anymore. 
He wanted to watch something burn. 
He wanted to destroy. 
His dreams were bombarded by him finding Cut again. 
By him plugging him with bullets, in just the right places to kill him slowly, giving him enough time for Sawyer to monologue him to death. 
He dreamed of that. 
Watching the look on his old partners face as he explained everything that lead up to the part where he was dying, in a growing pool of his blood. 
He saw himself, smiling, grinning, soaking it all up. 
Not the blood, just the gluttony of absorbing his old partner's shortcoming. 
(that might be a really gay pun. 
Leaving it in there. 
Maybe someone will get a chuckle.) Revenge was paramount. 
(another sexual pun? Pair of mount? Maybe. 
Might be a stretch. 
Save the stretches for the yoga puns. 
But that's another story.)
Might be getting ahead of myself in the drinking department. 
I’ve been sleepy all day and now i've been drinking Mom's tequila. 
Mom's rum. 
I know it's mom's because dad would be buying scotch and beer. 
And nothing else. 
My eyes are getting to that point of staring at the screen and wondering why i'm staring at the screen. 
Obviously, my writing's gotten to the point of staring at the screen and just typing words anyway. 
So if I can stare at the screen then I can write things that pass through my head. 
That's all fine and dandy. 
I MIGHT pass out soon. 
I might. 
I don;t know. 
I can't predict the future. 
I'd like to crank out words until I pass out face first on the keyboard. 
I'd like to do a lot of things. 
But, man. 
Man doesn't that take a lot out of a man. 
So the only answer is to just keep going. 
Just keep plugging away. 
And that's a difficult thing to do. 
Doesn't it matter that I wasn't working from a live copy of whatever i've written before this. 
No. 
Not even. 
Not even a little bit. 
It's all the same. 
I started with a blank page and i'm going to end with a blank page. 
Or at least the idea of a blank page because that's the only thing that could be after the page before it. 
Assuming that the pages never end. 
That's a stupid assumption. 
That must be math theory talking. 
I don't know anything about math theory but i'm fascinated by it. 
From what i've gather from what little I can understand, there's a concept of infinity. 
Within that concept are many other concepts. 
Most of which have a beginning and an end. 
Some dont'. 
But many do. 
But some don't. 
I don't care. 
You can go to hell. 
You can die and go to hell. 
FOUR MORE WORDS DONE.
-----
Ok ok ok. 
let’s check out our situation. 
Last thing i remember writing was Mr. 
President getting twisted with the aide. 
And Sawyer was working on his vengence. 
I suppose the next thread is our attack party in Romania. 
They need to take some retaliation action. 
Something scary and with in reach. 
Something we can all be afraid of. 
That would be good. 
They’re pretty much a nameless and faceless group of people. 
With the damages they could do… hmm
What would a group of political for profit group do for revenge. 
the banks maybe? dox some people. 
I don’t know.
-----
We think of the cloud as a kind of ethereal concept where data lives. 
The reality of the cloud is more like a large room full of rack mount servers. 
Picture a cage like locker room with climate controls and lots of blinking LEDs. 
Wires criss-crossing each other in zip tied clusters, each one with a label. 
The room is always under lock and key with cameras point at every entrance and exit. 
We like to think of the cloud as a giant hard drive that floats in the aether. 
We like to think that everything that goes into the cloud is safe and untouchable. 
This of course isn’t true at all. 
There’s a thousand ways in. 
Most of them are walking around with name tags. 
The weakest link is and always will be other people. 
And the easiest way to utilize them is to exploit their curiosity and their trust. 
This can be accomplished in a manner of different ways. 
I think we covered phishing and spear phishing earlier, so we’re going to take a different approach this time.
Our friends in Romania have some splinter groups or factions or friends. 
People all around the world near various facilities, waiting for orders. 
One foot solider is given marching orders for a data center in Maryland. 
He’s going to try a tried and true method of breaking into the place without setting foot in the door. 
He goes to his local office supply store and buys a box of low capacity USB keys. 
The rest of the process is a little meticulous if he hadn’t written scripts to accomplish it. 
He reformats all the keys and adds some code to the partition that is fired up whenever the key is inserted into a machine. 
He has that code check for the make and model of the machine, what kind of operating system is running, then it will trigger another script. 
The second script will find a process is each type of common computer on the market and latch onto it. 
It will create a backdoor that calls back to his computer at home and the group in Romania. 
It won’t have low level privilege, but it will be an in. 
It’ll be a start. 
From there, they can escalate and infiltrate.
Our guy on the ground takes handfuls of these USB keys and leaves them in the parking lot. 
He tails a few employees on lunch break to see where they go. 
He leaves a key or two near their car. 
Making it look like they must have dropped it. 
He peppers every place he thinks someone that works at the data center might look. 
Once he gets a hit, he has his home system pick up the connection and automatically work from there. 
For every hit he gets, a message pops up on his phone with the address of the compromised system and any information his scripts have gathered so far. 
If something really good comes up, he rushes home and takes over the autopilot. 
He keeps track for his own records and logs and to make sure his employers across the sea get what they pay for. 
He’s very good at his job. 
The lost USB key method has a 75% chance of success. 
Variations of this method include going up to the front desk and saying you found this outside and it probably belongs to someone. 
Or handing out CDs on the street. 
Or sending it via the post with a priority envelope and a return address that makes it seem like official business. 
Even if a person doesn’t recognize the device, more often than not, they want to know what’s on the disk. 
To minimize the failure rate, our guy has coded some juicy looking stuff to pop up and distract who ever was curious. 
Sometimes it’s some amatur pornography, sometimes it’s leaked company documents. 
Sometimes it’s a game, or some music. 
He tries to play it by ear, depending on who the target is. 
Some of you might be thinking, i’ve got an anti-virus set up that will detect these types of trojans. 
I’m totally safe and secure. 
Well, I’m sorry, but no. 
The code for the payload is what your antivirus is looking for. 
Usually a very specific few lines of code, like scanning for a signature. 
The clever attacker has a piece of software on his side that will run that signiture through a kind of sausage grinder, usually multiple times, making it look nothing like the original. 
The anti-virus has no idea what it’s looking and at and passes it along, thinking that everything is going just fine. 
The effort it takes to do this is minimal. 
The time it takes is fifteen minutes or less.
The man sat in his car, sipping his coffee, phone on his lap, waiting for the dings to start. 
Occasionally, he’ look out the window and see what was going on around him. 
Mostly he just looked at his phone, waiting for something. 
A call to action. 
It was two hours later that the alarms started going off. 
He started his car and drove back to the hotel room he was renting. 
After checking the progress of his scripts he had accumulated five separate points of entry. 
Within an hour he had administrator privileges on all of. 
He forwarded all of that information to Romania and continued probing. 
A major cloud service provider, with several government contracts and links to another large telecom company had their guts laid out in front of him. 
He dumps the database, giving him several thousand usernames and passwords, some encrypted, some in clear text. 
He sets up backdoors on each account and sets up an alert should anything be compromised.
Letting his machines run through a standard decrypting process, he takes a break, pops a few morphine pills and rolls a cigarette laced with cocaine. 
He stands on his balcony, in his underclothes, smoking slow and letting the chemicals massage his brain and body. 
All in a day’s work. 
He’d spend the next several hours waiting for the ding that let him know the money was transferred. 
Then treat himself to a steak dinner and the company of a women for a few hours. 
It was a living. 
It was good enough for him.
-----
In the basement of a nondescript building, Sawyer is plugging away in front of his desk in his solitary confine, under tight surveillance. 
He does several probes on his old friend. 
He finds everything he can find. 
His real name, his current addresses. 
Any phone numbers attached to him. 
Business contacts, lovers, family members, vehicle registration. 
He keeps all that information set aside, waiting for his project to reach completion. 
The main piece of coding is reaching the end. 
He just has a few more bugs to work out.
On November 2nd, 1988 the world of computer security changed forever. 
You might even say that the idea of needing computer security really started on that day. 
At least the public awareness of how vulnerable this project, later known as the internet, really was. 
A few days before his 23rd birthday, a student near MIT released a project he’d been working on that was going to try to map every connected UNIX machine in the world. 
He knew of a few vulnerabilities in the sendmail program that was standard, along with a handful of other services and a bunch of default passwords. 
The program would jump from machine to machine, replicating and looking for every host the computer was connected to. 
It was supposed to harmlessly travel and catalog every host that it found. 
Due to a small programming error, it reproduced out of control, crippling every machine it came into contact with. 
Within a few hours 20,000 computers were infected. 
this was the first instance of what became known as the Morris Worm. 
The fallout took days to recover, with teams working around the clock to isolate and remove the worm. 
Normal maintenance wouldn’t work, the worm just crawled back in. 
For more information, see Clifford Stoll’s fantastic book, The Cuckoo’s Nest (1989).
The real damage from the Morris Worm, as is the case with many new and fascinating crimes, are the copy cats. 
With a good programmer, all you really need is the idea. 
Figuring out how to execute the idea is half the fun. 
Debugging isn’t as much, but the thrill of working on something for months and seeing a successful run through is a very unique kind of rush. 
The idea of coding multiple viruses together, making it replicate and spread, and it some cases, adapt to various circumstances, has a wide appeal. 
All you need is the idea. 
Sawyer’s idea was grand in scale. 
It was all at once, elegant, sinister, devastating, and beautiful. 
He had all the time in the world, chasing cyber criminals around the world. 
His captors were never specific about when his debt to society would be paid, and in truth, viewed him more as too dangerous to be released back into the wild. 
If that ever did happen, he was sure they’d be watching his every move, waiting to catch him in the act again. 
Anything to continue his indentured servitude.
Time in the basement passed in unknown amounts. 
He hadn’t seen sunlight since his incarceration. 
He slept when he was tired, they fed him by sending a tray through the slot in the door. 
He didn’t talk to anyone, he didn’t listen to music. 
His whole world was in code. 
Day after day he would sit and type and test run. 
He would send his captures enough info to fill their quotas for caught criminals. 
The majority of this time was focused on getting his worm ready for launch day.
-----
The first direct action taken by the Romanians came on a grey, autumn morning, in the form of a data dump, what the industry refers to a doxing. 
Thousands of names, private emails, home addresses, job titles, hundreds of inter-office memos from every agency in the United States. 
All of it leaked to the internet for all to see. 
Undercover cops, secret agents, clandestine operations, racist private messages, evidence of fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit murder, proof of murders, drone strikes. 
All the dirty laundry they could find, airing out for all the world to see. 
All the numbers needed for to lock away some very high level officials. 
The world went into a tailspin. 
The U.N. 
was locked in session for several days. 
Washington D.C. 
was in full panic. 
The streets were clogged with riots and protests, with S.W.A.T. 
and cops and Military, some still loyal, some questioning what exactly, they had signed up for. 
The anger and outrage swept from state to state, coast to coast, around the world. 
Mr. 
President had been taken to his bunker far below the east wing of the White House. 
The phones were jammed with people yelling, screaming, in tears. 
Outside the people raged for justice. 
The tension that had been mounting for years, the conspiracy theories, the anger of the every citizen living under the poverty line, everything came crashing to a head.
The second act from Romania came a few days later, while the world was reeling in confusion and chaos. 
One by one, systems began to fail. 
The data farms for the NSA, the CIA, and FBI started to overload. 
Every automated system that was there to monitor national security was flooding with more information than it was capable of processes. 
Under normal circumstances, we’d call this a distributed denial of service attack. 
Under normal circumstances, this is done to a server or series of servers by requesting large amounts of information rapidly. 
Under normal circumstances, the server will go offline, or try to block the source of the requests, or just shut down until someone comes along to fix the problem. 
This was not a normal set of circumstances. 
While the whistleblowers of the world were busy combing through the first data dump, the Romanians were using that information to cripple the system from the inside. 
Many of the monitoring systems in place operated on sets of keywords that would trigger more extensive action. 
If you use your phone or email, or probably this whole manuscript i’ve been working on. 
Any communication medium. 
And you use words like, ‘bomb’ or ‘assassination’ or any one of hundreds of words that would catch the attention of someone looking to protect the national interests, as soon as you use one or more of those words the system will start logging your activities, depending on what it finds, you’ll move up or down a scale of how intense the logging will be, depending on the severity of what they find. 
The old idea that there’s someone reading your email is less accurate. 
A machine is. 
and if that machine finds something scary, it will report it further up the chain. 
If evidence is found to support cause of action, that’s usually when warrants are issued, or they just break down your door and take you away in the middle of the night. 
If you’ve followed the news for the last fifteen years, this shouldn’t be surprising to you.
The flaw in that system that no one was expecting anyone to be brazen enough to overload the system. 
The most advanced system in the world, with more capacity than any data system ever seen. 
No one would dare send an army of flag waving right to the front door. 
The genius move, the icing on the cake was inspired by what has become a horror movie cliche.
Think of the NSA as a babysitter, watching over little baby America in her crib upstairs. 
She tucks America in bed, sings it a little lullaby called “Everything is fine, go to sleep” and goes downstairs to watch some tv until Mom and Dad get home. 
She has the baby monitor on. 
Then the phone rings. 
On the other end of the line is a slimy voice, it only asks a question before hanging up. 
“Have you checked the kid lately?” and it hangs up. 
The babysitter runs upstairs and everything looks normal. 
America is sound asleep. 
Shaken, but more annoyed than anything, the babysitter goes back to watching TV. 
Then the phone rings again. 
Same story, slimy voiced creep asks about the kid. 
Once again, she runs upstairs, freaking out. 
Once again, everything is quiet upstairs. 
Wanting to put an end to this nonsense, the babysitter calls the police, asking them to trace a call. 
She says someone has been harassing her all night. 
The police person on the other end of the line asks her if this is a joke and exasperatedly, she says no, some creep has been calling her all night. 
Then the background music which has been building to a crescendo in the background suddenly stops and the cop says, “The call is coming from inside the house.” Then everyone screams and she runs upstairs and the kid is gone and she has to deal with a maniac trying to stab her in a kind of morbid version of Home Alone.
The Romanians managed to infiltrate the very system put in place to monitor all the communications and have them call each other, over and over again, repeating the list of keywords to each other. 
The engineers working to fix the problem found themselves locked out of their own system. 
Every failsafe they had put in place was turning on them. 
The plug was never designed to be pulled. 
No one ever had ever thought they would have to turn it off. 
Cleaning this mess up would take weeks. 
Maybe even months. 
In the meantime, the general public was free to go about it’s business for the first time in decades, without the watchful babysitter’s prying eyes. 
-----
“You wanna go loot some stuff?”
“Nah, I don’t need any more things.” The guy kicked a can. 
In the background there were buildings on fire. 
Some of them were even political buildings. 
All up and down the street people ran, yelling, breaking windows, and lighting things on fire.
“I don’t know when we got to the point as a species when this was our first reaction to corruption. 
I’m mean sure, i get the whole, the cat’s away thing. 
But seriously. 
I think most people would just want to keep going with their lives.”
“Hey, a lot of people are really mad.” The other guy takes a drink from his can of beer. 
“You can’t blame them a helluva lot.”
“The hell i can’t. 
There’s lots of people to blame, and people are certainly to blame for this mess.”
“Yeah, i guess you’re right about that.”
“I’m just wondering when people are going to get back to work. 
There’s a lot left to be done.”
“You think they’re going to rebuild the government, or what?”
“Yeah, i’m sure they will. 
Somehow, some way, they always find a means to put it back together the same. 
Maybe worse. 
The ones at the top aren’t stupid. 
Least, not as stupid as we want to think they are. 
They’re just mad they got caught.”
“Well, the national guard is having trouble keeping people on board. 
Those guys aren’t none too happy about all of it either.”
“True, true. 
Either way, it’s only a matter of time before they find some people that just want to get paid to wave guns around and corral the dissenters.”
“Gonna be fuckin’ animal farm around here.”
“IT’s been animal farm. 
it’s going to be more like the old soviet union.”
“That’s what animal farm was about, sort of.”
“oh, yeah. 
there’s that too.”
The two guys sit around drinking beers they took from the corner store. 
there wasn’t much left. 
The shopkeeper was long gone. 
Most people went to the banks to try and get their savings accounts out. 
Some people went to the banks to rob the place. 
Some people went to the stores and stockpiled food and water for the end of the world, which is what it was looking like.
“People want to hoot and holler about this and that. 
it’s all the same. 
ain’t nothin’ gonna change. 
any one in control is going to go down the same ol’ path. 
And what are we gonna do about it? fuckin’ nothin’.”
“I hear they’re calling in the army from around the world.”
“Yeah, they would do that when the cops were proving ineffective. 
police state is nothing. 
we’re going to be under martial law in a minute.”
“Damn shame. 
I was just starting to feel at home”
“That a fact? i was never too comfortable here. 
Something was always kinda off.”
“maybe that was something i could count on. 
Always could count on things being a bit off.”
“Yeah, you may be right. 
Maybe you are.” They both paused and took sips of beer and watched the flames of city hall reach far into the sky.
“lot of innocent people gonna get caught up in these fires.”
“mhmm. 
just wait till they start lynching people.”
“You think it’ll come to that?”
“I’m sure it already has in places. 
We’re just a bunch of scared, dumb animals. 
We still know it’s kill or be killed.”
“You sure gotta bleak outlook on life.”
“I don’t think of it like that. 
I’m just not surprised when people do these terrible things.”
“We shouldn’t think of it as normal. 
We have so much potential.”
“Yeah, maybe. 
We have a potential to do dumb shit when we’re scared, that much i do know.”
“You want to get a sandwich?”
“Yeah, why not.”
The two guys get up and walk down the street. 
There’s broken glass from shop windows that have been busted out all over the place. 
Smoke spills out of some of them. 
Different vehicles from SWAT to sedans are parked in the middle of the street. 
There’s a truck half way in the front window of the certified public accountant. 
Down the road a little ways in the sandwich shop they’d been going to all week. 
The place was a mess. 
debris all over the floor. 
thankfully the electricity was still on. 
A regular miracle during the past week. 
The guys walk into the back kitchen and start going through the refrigerators. 
They pull out some ham and tomatoes and cheese. 
They find a bag of rolls that isn’t moldy or stale, another small miracle.
“Oh hey, look at this!” one of the guys calls from a storage closet.
“What is it? i’m busy with the mustard.” he applies a thick coat of mustard dismissively.
“We got some refreshments! and quality ones at that.” He walks into the room with a twenty four count case of beer in the bottle. 
“Still cold on account of no insulation in here any more.
“Well la di da.” He allows himself a smile. 
They pop open some fresh beers and eat their sandwiches in the back room. 
No sense of attracting attention to their little lunch spot. 
This wasn’t a good time to be attracting attention.
“You know, back in my youth, i was always waiting for this day to come. 
You know, after reading the news all the time and being at school and everyone was so mad about the wars. 
Seemed like any day the bubble would burst and the fires of revolution would burn and the great ninety nine percent would concur all.
“No one had the guts. 
And anyone that talked that extreme was labeled a terrorist and never heard from again.”
“Exactly. 
But now that it’s happening, i don’t know. 
It’s just not what i was expecting.”
“revolution is never a clean thing. 
People always have to die. 
Fires always have to burn. 
Heads will roll, as the French said.”
“Let’s put some of these beers in the cooler.”
“Alright.”
They finished their sandwiches and drank their beers. 
They spent a lot of their time in silence. 
Just listening to chaos that was happening outside. 
Occasionally, people would march past the shop, shouting in unison, something about burning the rich and the only good politician is a dead politician. 
In the first few days they’d hear sirens not far behind. 
Now, they heard gunshots, but they were happening with less frequency.
“pretty soon, they’re going to run out of places to burn and people to kill. 
Or what’s left of the military is going to come in and rain hell on the lot of them.”
“Yeah, I imagine so.”
“at least we got this old place to ourselves for the time being.”
“For the time being. 
I guess that’s all we can really ask for.”
The sun set on the town and a few undamaged street lights managed to flicker to life. 
The fires were starting to die down and the marching protesters were losing steam. 
None of them were thinking about rebuilding. 
No one really knew what to do when the anger turned into a tired whimper. 
The people that still had homes shuffled off to get some rest. 
See if there was any news. 
Somehow, most of the infrastructure was still operational. 
The phone lines mostly worked. 
The power hadn’t gone out everywhere yet. 
The water was running. 
Aside from that, you could mostly forget about it. 
Schools were out until further notice, most kids that didn’t get locked up at home had joined the rally, demanding the blood of the mayor, the president, the senate. 
At this point, the people didn’t know or care if anyone in a position of power was innocent or not. 
They all had to go. 
jail wasn’t really an option. 
Reformation wasn’t going to be enough. 
Community service would have been too kind. 
It had to be public, it had to be bloody.
----
Deep in his basement prison cell, Sawyer knew something was very wrong when the food stopped coming. 
The power flickered every now and again, another cause for concern. 
He figured, after three days, that it was now or never.
Phase one of the worm would take out all the surveillance in the building and anything attached to the same network. 
It was not the sneaky kind of taking out the surveillance popular in movies and television where the crafty thieves loop footage on all the cameras so that no one suspects a thing. 
This worm just knocked it right out. 
erased everything. 
The footage, the software, the firmware, the drivers.
Phase two would disable all door locks, all security systems, and clog the phone systems. 
He didn’t have a radio jammer, so taking out any communications beyond the phone lines was impossible. 
He would have to make due. 
That should be enough to get him out of the building.
Phase three was coded to get into the outside world. 
Phase three had the goal of ruining his old partner, Carter. 
The worm would shift Carter’s finances to some shady and illegal operations. 
Lots of drug money on the dark web, frame him in with some cartels, make it international. 
After the money looked like it was going to some criminal places he would leak the story to every news outlet, every blog, twitter feed. 
Carter’s reputation would be shot in the course of several minutes. 
The worm would make it look like a classic slip up. 
Letting some personal data go unencrypted on the dark web on an exit node that was owned by the cops. 
He was pretty sure that the feds were already watching Carter very closely. 
He was sure that they’d be at his door soon and having him in a nicely wrapped package of evidence land on their digital doorstep would only help them out. 
Sure, it would look like a classic betrayal situation, but the feds didn’t care. 
It was more leverage.
Sawyer clicked return and counted. 
He estimated that it would take thirty seconds before the doors open. 
He started counting in his head and thinking about his exit strategy. 
Part of his siphoning of Carter’s money went to purchase himself a new identity which would land in an old P.O. 
Box of his. 
Another chunk would be deposited into a checking account that would then get routed to an overseas bank. 
He would then close that account out and have the money transferred to him in cash. 
He was a little fuzzy on the details of getting that cash, but wanted the money to pass through several channels before he got to it. 
Just covering his tracks. 
He needed a phone, and he needed an internet connection. 
He needed to get somewhere safe as soon as possible. 
He really needed something to eat.
The doors clicked open. 
He had counted to one hundred. 
Something was slowing the system down. 
He stepped out of his cell and looked around. 
There was no one there. 
No guards, nothing. 
it was very quiet. 
In the other cells, people stirred to wakefulness. 
the exhaustion of having not eaten for a few days led to many of them trying to sleep until some food came up. 
Sawyer wasted no time. 
They’d have to figure it out for themselves. 
He found a staircase at the end of the hall and run up two steps at a time. 
He flung open the door to the next floor up and it was the same story, empty hall. 
no guards. 
A few confused prisoners walking around. 
He went back to the stairwell and ran up another flight. 
He did the same thing for three more stories. 
He opened the next door and the hallway was different. 
There were cubicles with no one in them. 
His worm had clogged all the computers here, every screen was a buzz with activity. 
Windows opening and closing, text being typed by ghosts, everything flying around at superhuman speed. 
He rummaged around the desks for anything he could use, he found some keys and a flashlight. 
He didn’t know the time of day, that might come in handy. 
He found a pack of gum and greedily chewed a piece. 
The rush of flavor in his mouth was overwhelming. 
It knocked some sense into him. 
Where was everyone? had they gone home for the day? shouldn’t they at least have left someone to keep an eye on things? He was a dangerous criminal. 
He was a menace to society. 
He felt a little insulted.
He tore down the hallway, looking for anything he could use. 
If only he knew what happened to his back pack. 
Where would you keep things taken from the prisoners? He had no idea. 
Was there a map of this building? a fire escape plan would be really nice right about now. 
It was a government operation, i’m sure there was some regulations about that kind of thing. 
Even in tech prison. 
He made it to the end of the floor and didn’t find a damn thing. 
Up the stairs again. 
He stopped to catch his breath. 
All this time underground, sitting at a desk, sleeping whenever. 
He was more out of shape than usual. 
He opened the next door. 
More cubicles. 
Maybe something here he could use. 
He rummaged around, now feeling alone and a little more safe. 
Also concerned. 
There should be SOMEONE here. 
aside from the prisoners, of course. 
He found a staff break room and the fridge was still running. 
He found some questionable items, but there was a cup of yogurt and a banana. 
Brain food, probably for the best to have something soft for his first meal in three days. 
He inhaled everything quickly and went back to looking for something to help, looking for an exit. 
At the other end of the room, he found a goldmine. 
Someone left a laptop sitting on their desk. 
That was the best thing he could have hoped for. 
Now he just needed to get out. 
He found the escape plan. 
Two more floors to climb. 
He was going to loot the place, but in a hurry. 
It was only a matter of time before someone would come along and wonder what the hell he was doing. 
he was going to bet that the person that would find him would be armed. 
He didn’t want to wait around for him. 
On the next floor he found a shopping bag, that would help with carrying the laptop. 
He had some strength coming back to him and leaped up the stairs to what the map said was the exit. 
He hurried his way past the front desk, his brain so focused on the exit that he only noticed the broken glass in passing. 
He was too focused on getting out. 
He saw the front door and ran.
He pushed through the door and all around him ashes rained down. 
The world was grey. 
He smelled burning. 
The kind of burning smell that indicated that things were on fire that shouldn’t be. 
Objects never meant to burn. 
He blinked in the mix of daylight and ashen overcast. 
What the hell had happened? What new hell was this?
------
Getting closer to the end and made the mistake of going to a coffee shop. 
So many people. 
So many distractions. 
The buzz and hum of many conversations turns into a kind of static in the background. 
White noise from white people. 
I’m coming up on the final countdown. 
It’s the last day for this project. 
I have about 2400 words to wrap this story up. 
Might as well get to it. 
save the rant for the end.
-----
“MR. 
PRESIDENT!”
The most powerful man in the world was asleep on his sleeve, his suit wrinkled and his face wrinkled and his spirit soaked in spirits. 
He roused from his substance induced slumber and cracked a bloodshot eye at the aide that entered his chambers deep underground below the white house. 
HIs private bunker built during the second world war, strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast. 
He felt safe, if not stressed out. 
He felt helpless and angry. 
If only they’d taken his military advisors suggestion and bombed the shit out of Romania. 
If only he could go back in time and stop this mess before it started. 
This was no time to live in regrets.
“What was your name again?”
“Thompson, sir.”
“Thompson, right. 
what’s the latest from the surface?”
“The people are still rioting, sir. 
The streets are clogged with dissent and they want to hear from you. 
I suspect they want your head.”
“That’s great. 
Great news.” The president looked around his desk for something to drink. 
A bottle of painkillers, some stimulants to balance out the opiates. 
Anything to kick his brain into working for a little while longer. 
His hairs were greying rapidly. 
He had aged more in the last few days than most presidents do during their whole term. 
He was, over all things, a very tired man.
“Thompson, do we have anything left to drink is this hell hole?”
“Yes, sir.” Thompson exited the room and returned with a jug of ice water and a decanter of brown liquid.
“That’s spirit. 
that’s why i wanted you here. 
No messing around. 
You’re a good man, Thompson.”
“Thank you, sir.”
“glasses!”
“Yes, sir.”
The president poured them both three fingers of the brown liquor.
“Cheers,” Mr. 
President said, “To the end of the civilized world.” He downed the whole glass and filled it again. 
Thompson took a liberal gulp and eyed the president wearily.
“How goes progress with operation payback?”
“The strike was ordered to execute at 2200 hours. 
We’re awaiting confirmation of destruction, sir.”
“Excellent, that’s great news.”
-----
High in the skies of Romania a small fleet of jet fighters equipped with bunker buster bombs are flying out of radar range.
“Angel of Mercy, this is Angel of Death, over.”
“Roger, Angel of Death target is approaching, ready when you are.”
“Ready and willing, Angel of Mercy, commencing deployment. 
on my count, fire.”
Three thumbs flick open the panel revealing little red buttons.
“3. 
2. 
1. 
Fire!”
Three thumbs press down and six units fall from the wings. 
The bombs point straight down. 
The bunker buster is a bomb designed to penetrate concrete up to several meters before detonating. 
On the ground the first bomb hits and in the bunker a dozen faces look at each other before an explosion rips through the room, sending fire and flaming debris in all directions. 
Vaporizing flesh and electronics with equal prejudice.
“Angel of Mercy, do you copy?”
“We copy Angel of Death, target destroyed, return to base.”
“Roger that.”
Another diplomatic mission accomplished. 
A little too little, too late.
-----
1900 words to go, you can do this.
-----
The world was plunged into a kind of chaos unknown for generations. 
it was a wonder that some people felt compelled to try to keep things running. 
The mail was one of those things. 
Nor rain nor snow nor sleet nor hail nor revolution nor eroded faith in the powers that be. 
The military had been called in to restore order while the president hid away in his bunker, engaged in his own war with his liver. 
His wife and children were being kept away from him. 
Thompson was the only person he allowed into his office. 
Even then it was only to drink, mostly in silence. 
He would ask on occasion about the situation on the surface. 
The news was never what he wanted to hear. 
He almost missed the old meetings they used to have. 
The sour looks of his diplomatic advisor. 
The constant aggression of his military man. 
The table with all the spooks and yes men and double agents. 
He missed the good old days. 
And he drank, waiting for the storm to pass and some semblance of order to be restored.
Sawyer had managed to loot a few tools. 
He found a working cell phone. 
He found a place that hadn’t been fire bombed by the angry public, enough for him to plug in and see how far his revenge worm had gotten. 
Not far enough after the banks collapsed. 
Not as far as he was hoping. 
He looked everywhere for signs that his old friend was active somewhere, but was coming up empty. 
Figures. 
He no doubt had a backup plan in case of this kind of scenario. 
His prison contacts probably helped him a great deal. 
Sawyer found a place to camp out near his old P.O. 
Box, in hopes that his new identity would arrive and his money would follow. 
He managed to get back on the net by piggy backing on his cell signal. 
The people that ran the networks knew that above all, the network needed to stay online. 
If we lost that, we’d lose everything. 
All hope would be lost. 
All communication would be next to impossible. 
Aside from radio. 
The radio stations were some of the last remaining sources of news. 
That and a handful of blogs, likely ran from bunkers and cabins far away from the chaos of the cities. 
Sawyer watched and waited. 
He would leave on occasion to scrounge for food. 
His supplies were getting lower and lower. 
At least the water was still running.
He found himself in front of a mostly intact sandwich shop and decided to take a look inside. 
He heard voices coming from the back and proceeded with caution. 
He’d run into a few other people, they mostly reacted violently with fear, running and avoiding confrontation.
“I heard they’re building camps again.”
“Yeah, it was only a matter of time.” The voices were coming from the back room. 
Sawyer poked his head around the corner to try and get a good look at the people behind the sounds.
“OH looky! we got a live one!” one of the voices hollered at Sawyer.
“Shit!” Sawyer said, scrambling to his feet, fight or flight telling him to get the hell out of there.
“No need to run, boy. 
We’re not interested in hurting or robbing you.” One of the guys said, putting down his beer bottle. 
The other one was laughing, but trying not to be rude about it. 
“We won’t bite, come over here. 
have a beer, they’re still cold.”
Sawyer walked over with caution, keeping his guard up. 
His world was lies and deception. 
trust was a vulnerability waiting to be exploited.
“there, there. 
nothin’ to be scared of. 
we’re just looking to relax, not get shot. 
you ain’t planning on shooting up our little hideaway are ya?”
“Don’t have a gun. 
Not really my thing.”
“Oh good, here, have a beer.” The guy offered him an open bottle.
“Thanks.” He said, taking a long drink.
“Hey there, manners, manners. 
What’s your name, boy?”
“Tim.” Sawyer said.
“well, Tim. 
Cheers.” the three men clinked bottles together.
“Cheers,” the other two said. 
It seemed an odd sentiment given the circumstances.
“Hey you hungry? we got some sandwich making supplies still. 
Enough to last us a while. 
Certainly more than we can eat before it starts to rot. 
Help yourself.”
“Thanks again.” Sawyer says finding the bag of sandwich rolls.
“So what brings you to the new american dream, Tim?”
“Oh you know, nothing else to do.”
“Pfft, plenty to do if you got the willpower. 
We’re just waiting for this whole mess to blow over. 
Reminds of another time we saw this kind of thing go down. 
Back in Berkeley in ‘09. 
Something of an uprising. 
They squashed that one pretty fast though. 
Buncha’ bums trying to take over the town.”
“hoo, i remember that one. 
we almost made it too. 
lacked public support. 
that was our problem. 
this time the public was all up in arms. 
didn’t take them long to start fires and yanking the politicians out of their home. 
It was like the french revolution happening all over the country. 
The counties that had guns were the first and bloodiest.”
“Jesus,” Sawyer said drooling at his ham sandwich. 
He started eating it greedily. 
“what a mess.”
“you can say that.”
“As big a mess as we’ve ever seen. 
Wonder how the rest of the world is going on. 
I bet it’s just as bad everywhere.”
“who knows. 
who cares. 
ain’t my problem or yours. 
i’m more concerned with our dwindling beer supply.”
“There’ll be more beers. 
There has to be.”
“I suppose you’re right.”
“Know any places around here that have some cigarettes?” Sawyer asked in between chews.
“There might be. 
They did a number on all the corner shops when the looting began.”
“i know a place a few blocks from here. 
They got everything in the front, but the store room is mostly intact.”
“Gotta keep a supply of the essentials.”
“cheers to that!” the two guys clinked bottles and set them down with an empty thud.
“I suppose it’s about time to find another case of beer too. 
We’ll have a couple more cold ones waiting for us upon return.”
“yeah, i guess you’re right.”
Sawyer finished his sandwich and drank his beer. 
“You guys mind if i tag along? We’d be safer as a group.”
“You think so? I suppose you’re right. 
Makes a kind of sense. 
Not a lot of that going around any more.”
“mhmm. 
let’s get going. 
I want to get back here before dark.”
The three guys picked up their packs and started walking. 
The smouldering wreckage was smoking in the early dim of dusk. 
Stray dogs and cats chased each other on the streets. 
Some of the buildings had faces looking out at them, watching wide eyed with fear, unblinking and watchful. 
Huddled and hoping the three guys didn’t turn and try to loot or kill.
“jesus, what became of this place. 
I haven’t had a smiling face in days. 
Nothing but fear. 
all the cops have moved on from this place. 
I bet they’re over at the capital, waiting for someone to be in charge. 
waiting for marching orders.”
He wasn’t wrong. 
The capitals across the country were surrounded by mobs of people camping out. 
Everyone was waiting for a leader. 
Everyone was getting restless. 
The energy that fueled the revolution was dying off and most people were returning to their homes, trying to figure out what to do next. 
The rest, the politically minded, the ones that believed in a system of functioning government, camped out, looking for guidance on the next move. 
in situations where people are looking for a leader, it’s assured that someone, usually severally people, will think they know what’s best for everyone. 
And so it was that all across the country, small governments reformed. 
Systems were established. 
the old city halls and courtrooms were filled again. 
And clean up began. 
one by one, the basic functions were restored and the people did what they could to restore life to the way it was. 
The armed forces had all congregated in washington D.C. 
slowly taking back the city from the revolutionaries. 
It didn’t take too long for even the most loyal recruit to figure out that the old ways were gone. 
That the people in charge were promising paychecks from banks that no longer existed. 
It didn’t take long for them to take their issued rifles and go find a shelter or a plot of land and call it their own.
----
In his bunker, Mr. 
President and Thompson were drinking the last store of the liquor. 
They were both getting sick from liver poisoning and malnutrition. 
The rest of the officials had long since departed to the surface, some to die, some to surrender.
“Thompson, i’d like to propose a toast, to you for your loyalty in these troubling times.”
“Thank you, sir. 
Means the world to me.”
They touched glasses and drank the brown liquor down easily. 
having long sensed become numb and accustomed to the taste and smell of their liquid diet.
“You’re much more than an aide and advisor. 
I feel privileged to call you friend.”
“Really, sir. 
that’s too much.” the alcohol haze brought tears to their eyes.
“Thompson, i feel a powerful sleep approaching. 
I am a very tired man.”
“Yes, sir.” Thompson was tired too. 
He felt it wasn’t appropriate to admit this to the most powerful man in the world. 
He wanted to be tough until the end.
“I.. 
think… i’m just gonna.. 
lay down for a bit.”
“As you wish, sir.” Thompson refilled his glass and drank it down, no longer feeling the burn, not really feeling anything except an empty splash in his guts.
The president slumped off his chair and landed on the rug, soiled with spills and ashes. 
Mr. 
President curled into the fetal position and began snoring loudly. 
Thompson walked over to the flag hanging proudly from the pole. 
With great reverence of a high priest, he took the flag down. 
He walked over to the president humming the national anthem. 
With the greatest care he draped the flag over the president’s sleeping body. 
Thompson sat back down in his chair in front of the presidential desk. 
He poured himself a long drink. 
and polished off the bottle. 
He took a long look at the great seal of the United States. 
He looked at the majesty of the Eagle. 
He was feeling sick and a little dizzy. 
The room was gearing up to spin around him. 
He put the glass to his lips and looked down at the sleeping, snoring figure of the most powerful man in the world. 
He closed his eyes and tilted his head back, taking the last gulp of brown liquor, letting it hit him in his rapidly deteriorating guts. 
He put the glass down on the desk, stiffened his back and gave a salute. 
God Bless America.
The END.

Author’s final note. 
Epilogue.
So, that’s it. 
I made my goal with time to spare. 
this may be a first for me. 
And were i not lazy and skipped some days that i was perfectly capable of getting some writing done, or distracted by whatever, I probably could have doubled the word count. 
Too many days were spent going, well, i hit 1666. 
that’s over with. 
Despite all of that, one thing did happen that I am happy about. 
writing 5k today was a fairly painless experience. 
It was actually, one of the easiest days i had writing this big ol’ blob of shit. 
And if anything, that’s how it should be. 
I had something of an ending in mind. 
And I’m pretty ok with how everything turned out. 
Sawyer meets the bums. 
Carter has disappeared. 
The world is a mess and is trying to fix itself the only way it knows how. 
With more violence and the same old tired politics. 
It’s a pretty good nobody wins situation. 
I haven’t read back through anything. 
And i’m going to give it a few days before i do. 
The idea of completion, in some sense, has been achieved. 
I do feel that overall, I set out to do this and I did it. 
and that was worth the whole month, The next step is to keep some momentum going. 
to keep improving on writing. 
to get better and re-learn how to actually tell a story that i want to tell. 
Right now i’m tired. 
my brain is operating on a few hours of sleep, my eyes are dry, my throat is dry. 
my sense of humor is dry.
I learned a lot of things this month. 
i learned about the current state of hacking culture and the terrible state that our collective sense of security is in. 
I learned that rushing into a writing project with zero prep and thought going into it except, “I want to write about the new cold war.” wasn’t the best idea. 
And granted, if i took out all the asides and rabbit trails, i’d be hard pressed to hit 25k of actual content. 
of that maybe 10% is probably salvageable. 
But that’s too bad. 
I’m going to keep writing some gibberish until the 12:00 hits. 
Just to add some padding to this nonsense. 
keep the old digits moving. 
Or not. 
I keep getting distracted. 
I guess that’s going to be my new year’s resolution. 
focus on what i’m trying to do. 
And with that, I’m going to put a nail in this project and call it a night. 
Pour myself a stiff drink and bid ye adieu.
