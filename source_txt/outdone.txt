BEGIN NOW "One day you will watch it all fall away, and you will be left with only that which truly is." He said, his sad old man eyes gleaming like sad blue diamonds in twin caves.  END
BEGIN NOW He's such a sad old man.  END
BEGIN NOW Hard to look at sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW Why he chose me to rattle his folk ramble whims, I haven't the slightest clue, unless it has to do with my passive enjoyment of his regular flow of semi-irregular babble.  END
BEGIN NOW But he was so precise in his seemingly chaotic expression that I could never quite tell if he were reciting a pre-written diatribe or some classic monologue, or just his own special ramblings.  END
BEGIN NOW Today he was talking about friends, and groups.  END
BEGIN NOW Never get all six of them to the same barbecue again.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's not true.  END
BEGIN NOW "Not true til proven true." He'd say, "And you prove it true every day." And I feel it wrench from my hands, memories and patterns and morning routines and afternoon meet up spots.  END
BEGIN NOW God, what a depressing old man, making me think all mushy.  END
BEGIN NOW I got up and walked out, walked a mile to the edge of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Found the hillside we used to climb with 40s.  END
BEGIN NOW So much of this feels empty now.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel thin and hollow. END
BEGIN NOW Not hungry, empty. END
BEGIN NOW I want to vomit my response across the sky to the world, a collage mural of my analysis.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to explain myself.  END
BEGIN NOW AUTHORS NOTE SHANGRI LA AND THEO JAMES : An Intro concerning the origins of the Author END
BEGIN NOW We were all born in a little town called Shangri La California.  END
BEGIN NOW Unaware of our incapacity to age, we treated ourselves like mortals, eventually convincing ourselves and thus transforming ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Some found this result in travels, others in stationary trending.  END
BEGIN NOW Something keeps them, us; from realizing and accepting.  END
BEGIN NOW This dark wet hesitance that lays on our gumption like a lead vest. END
BEGIN NOW Theo James spent years teaching us his logics on the redwood deck and under the covered bridge.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always around and ready to explain just why it was we weren't allowed to say certain words or sing certain songs.  END
BEGIN NOW "This is the Age of Appearance.  END
BEGIN NOW We have become aware of the literal application of human programming, and have tied it directly to superficial expression, thus presentation supplants reality." He spoke often of ages, and often spoke on the concept of ages.  END
BEGIN NOW "An Age lasts as long as a generation.  END
BEGIN NOW between the time you're born and the time you make a baby is a generation.  END
BEGIN NOW See, an Age only lasts until it's replaced, but there are always a series of Ages occurring at once, and it can be said that all previous Ages that have occurred are now happening simultaneously, and any new Age only adds to the din.  END
BEGIN NOW This continues until we take a dimensional shift and accept all Ages as occurring simultaneously, which will complicate our theory of time and various other seemingly transparent matters."  END
BEGIN NOW We were too young to get most of it.  END
BEGIN NOW fourteen, sixteen, eighteen.  END
BEGIN NOW Even at twenty, we still just kept him near as a side kick eccentric, and never as a great teacher.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that was intentional though.  END
BEGIN NOW He said all truth comes in the form of punch lines, but he wasn't that funny, which kind of suggests that he was full of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW But his favorite underdog is the failed inventor, finding thousands of new and unexpected ways to not quite do what he was hoping.  END
BEGIN NOW Failure is just a negative expression of discovery.  END
BEGIN NOW "Not to say that all discovery is positive.  END
BEGIN NOW Quite the opposite.  END
BEGIN NOW Choosing your realm mode and style of discovery is vital to maintaining a positive self perpetuating pattern." END
BEGIN NOW I refuse to describe him, because you would stop listening.  END
BEGIN NOW You would shrug off his input as obscene and absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW You would condemn him based on an incapacity to integrate.  END
BEGIN NOW "Ennit funny how I'm the one who can't seem to integrate, but I'm the only one who's still friends with everybody? How is that not integrating? That's better than integrating.  END
BEGIN NOW It's assimilation." The town loved him, but hated all that he stood for, and he could never hold clear how he felt about the town.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweet mad Shangri la California, No duplicate exists in all the realms of all the mythologies of evermore.  END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere else are all the girls cursed to live betwixt some sort of forest nymph fairy experience of the sprawling redwood womb of these woods.  END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere else do the young men go mad and run screaming up and down the streets in search of the demon that's taken hold of their boot strings.  END
BEGIN NOW One man lives on the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW He paces his sandstone ridge and digs worry lines with his feet, deep enough for the satellites to see.  END
BEGIN NOW He does not remember why he left, or what he hoped to find.  END
BEGIN NOW All he remembers is why it's not safe down there in the town. END
BEGIN NOW Another man lives in a hole by the river.  END
BEGIN NOW He whistles at night to call spirits to him, hoping they'll tell him stories darker than his.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't remember when he fell away, or why he would want to be any other way, but he knows more than he's willing to hold, and looks for ways to loosen it.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweet mad Shangri La California, mother of chaotic children of fury, lost in the mourning of moments unhinging.  END
BEGIN NOW He stabbed Melvin here, thirteen years ago today.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't look at the date.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not your birthday anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps that's the line you're looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW It's no longer a magical holiday.  END
BEGIN NOW The fairies are gone, and the demons now play.  END
BEGIN NOW In the tilted the falling the whim of the way.  END
BEGIN NOW We battle the burgeoning depths of decay, send innocence stumbling back on her way. END
BEGIN NOW It's a mad cap mount 'em shut em down party town that won't stop breakin shit and shattering and scattering the semblance of knowledge compiled and held, END
BEGIN NOW softly tightly in secret queit pauses, hiding the raw depth of raw.  END
BEGIN NOW Not mine.  END
BEGIN NOW Not me.  END
BEGIN NOW Not here, no how no way. END
BEGIN NOW INTRODUCTION TO THE WRITING STYLE OR LACK THEREOF END
BEGIN NOW There once was a time when I'd fly off the handle and run to my notebook to scramble down thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW There once was a time when that's all that I wanted, that's all that I sought in my daily onslaught of wandering whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW At a certain point i forgot what I wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW My notes became clouded and scrambled.  END
BEGIN NOW One note sends me through thick heavy words of past masters, reminding me of my capacities to speak intellectually to the up and ups, the educated, the echelon.  END
BEGIN NOW Another note pulls me towards awareness, not tied to the patterns and myths of society, not caught in the rat trap of repitition, rather baiting my subconscious so as to launch it off into realms unknown in hopes of bringing back thoughts of worth. END
BEGIN NOW I used to listen to strangers talk on the bus and jot down their conversations, no matter how bland and empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Simply tracking the interaction of strangers, my third role permanizing the occurence for all time.  END
BEGIN NOW What do I do now? I look at the words on the page and gauge my connection to them and their capacity to reflect that which is.  END
BEGIN NOW The expressive loop lacks the flesh of literal experience, and the author is forced to throw in some sort of actual occurrence to bring the reader back to something that actually exists apart from language. END
BEGIN NOW This is a very specific intro written by a writer who claims not to write, and yet he writes daily.  END
BEGIN NOW He jots down and struggles with cover letters and business plans and project management logics, but his words are no longer the feather spark fliers that waltz across the sky and burn the eyes of every unwitting passerby.  END
BEGIN NOW He has quit every project he started, calling them off with a vague "post-poned!" unwilling to accept anything as disowned.  END
BEGIN NOW But this is a moment of realism.  END
BEGIN NOW A moment frozen in time.  END
BEGIN NOW This is now and post-poned means dead, abandoned, and irrelevant.  END
BEGIN NOW The development of past projects can be justified as partial projects aimed at developing project capacities, and this to a certain extent is true, but competion and release are the things that have kept the author frozen in this loop of managerial ramblings.  END
BEGIN NOW He's trying.  END
BEGIN NOW He really is.  END
BEGIN NOW He's always known how to start.  END
BEGIN NOW You sit down, get excited, follow the flow and don't bother crossing your eyes, but dotting your t's is fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Manifest.  END
BEGIN NOW Manifest with zest gusto gumption and puzaz.  END
BEGIN NOW We are not tracing delicate veins here.  END
BEGIN NOW We are not slicing open the mucose membrane of the mylean sheath to see the literal pathways of thought, rather we are throwing our subconscious out of a plane and letting it scream its dying words as it hurtles earthward.  END
BEGIN NOW We are bringing ourselves into a mental picture that we convince ourselves is real to prompt what possible reaction we might have to such a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Last visit home I read the paper and saw that an old man had died falling off a cliff that overlooked the river above a bridge by a certain hairpin curve.  END
BEGIN NOW I pondered the thought and found myself there 10 years prior.  END
BEGIN NOW "I been there!" I said to my dad.  END
BEGIN NOW "I climbed that cliff, and almost fell. Almost died like he did!" Seemingly meaningless drivel.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW His moment of death was preceded ten years by my moment on that same cliff side, sliding and frantically clinging to tiny seedling trees, unsure for the first time ever, whether I'd make it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another tiny meaningless trigger tracing paths and possibilities as occurrences continue to accrue along the infinite stretching tongue of paper our pens play across, skidding along, hesitant to stop, for in stagnation is death and the sliding earth beneath us brings us closer to the cliff by the bridge overlooking a certain hairpin curve.  END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 1  JUNK THRU SKAT   Berkeley, 2008 END
BEGIN NOW I walk into the living room which is graced by my mattress, which in turn is encircled by stacks of notebooks torn fragments of stories and drifting bits of poetry.  END
BEGIN NOW A sloppy expanding cradle of crumpled papers.  END
BEGIN NOW I grab another beer and crumple into my mess of a nest.  END
BEGIN NOW My free hand finds a pen and a scrap of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW What’ll it be this time? A poem perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW JUNK END
BEGIN NOW After six sexless months END
BEGIN NOW Your junk begins to look like just that. END
BEGIN NOW A broken down rusted out ford END
BEGIN NOW Forgotten in the vacant lot END
BEGIN NOW Between your legs. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a unique sense of satisfaction I achieve by writing this.  END
BEGIN NOW I still feel like shit.  END
BEGIN NOW But it’s my shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit happens.  END
BEGIN NOW And hey, what’s a little shit between friends?  END
BEGIN NOW I think it’s Monday.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably time I left the house.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been two days since I’ve even seen the outside.  END
BEGIN NOW My sleep has been sporadic to say the least.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been checking whether it’s AM or PM.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s no good.  END
BEGIN NOW No bueno.  END
BEGIN NOW So I grab my junk and open the front door.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as I expected.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing’s changed.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure how I feel about life’s incessant consistency.  END
BEGIN NOW I decide to remain passive and just walk to campus.  END
BEGIN NOW The slow steady pattern of one foot after another always helps to heal the headspace. END
BEGIN NOW When Walt Disney was a kid, he would use tar to paint cartoon animals on the side of his father’s barn.  END
BEGIN NOW That is fucking beauty.  END
BEGIN NOW That is immortal.  END
BEGIN NOW It might be a bullshit story invented by his biographers to make him seem more palatable.  END
BEGIN NOW But the concept is pure.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps that’s why I’m trying to do, capture that purity.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the innocence, No, that’s long gone.  END
BEGIN NOW But the sudden impulse.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ve called it “Poetic Genius” and clever names like that, but I call it gumption. END
BEGIN NOW Gumption is the power to exist.  END
BEGIN NOW The generational belly fire.  END
BEGIN NOW The electric vibrations of eyes to wide and jaw too tight.  END
BEGIN NOW On a mountain side or beneath a streetlight, it’s the flashing brilliance of thought and desperate creation.  END
BEGIN NOW Skidding through the kitchen, switching off the stove so as to prolong the writing binge.  END
BEGIN NOW Fire under food might pull me from the writing room. END
BEGIN NOW Gumption is every single word you’ve written for no one but yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW The shit that comes because it has to.  END
BEGIN NOW Not because they’ll buy it, or maybe start to like you.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck them.  END
BEGIN NOW They just wanna fuck you and then shit on you.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what they do.  END
BEGIN NOW Every single time.  END
BEGIN NOW First they fuck you, then they shit on you.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t bother being popular.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like masturbating at the punch table and yelling to the hostess, “This party’s great!” END
BEGIN NOW It makes me think of an art piece I saw once.  END
BEGIN NOW The MOMA, perhaps? In England? Five years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a video of the artist, naked and alone, wearing nothing but boxing gloves and a mask.  END
BEGIN NOW He keeps trying to masturbate with the boxing gloves, but when that fails, he pummels himself in the face until he falls to the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW It seems like he set the whole thing up.  END
BEGIN NOW By himself.  END
BEGIN NOW In a dark drunken stupor.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope I never get that drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me morbidly of videos sent by lonely young women to their men in Iraq, to visually say “your lady still loves you.” Except this was a nameless artist, sending his meaningless masochism across half a century to me.  END
BEGIN NOW At the time I thought the entire piece was just a cry for attention.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, I figure it’s a graphic display of how our creative drive (sex) when stifled becomes a destructive drive (masochism) … END
BEGIN NOW I decide that walking isn’t helping, so I find the closest bus stop and begin the waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW I check my watch, check the schedule, and decide I don’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit on the bench waiting for something to hit me.  END
BEGIN NOW For half a second I expect it to be bird shit, but nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW No occurence of any mentionable kind.  END
BEGIN NOW My head slowly goes from left to right, and back to center, scanning the streets for something of interest.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW I pull out my notebook and flip through the pages.  END
BEGIN NOW Disgusting.  END
BEGIN NOW No, disappointing.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a few pieces I like, but I suddenly hate them, because they claim to be done.  END
BEGIN NOW And yet, certain sentences insist on wearing army boots, stomping along through the flower garden of emotion I try to lay down.  END
BEGIN NOW …why do I consistently hate my writing? END
BEGIN NOW Good lord, the world swims before me.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything keeps sliding out of place.  END
BEGIN NOW But I find my way onto the bus without a scene.  END
BEGIN NOW I shuffle to the back and find a good spot with a window to lean against.  END
BEGIN NOW Out comes the notebook, and I scramble down a sloppy doodle face.  END
BEGIN NOW A quick crummy doodle face.  END
BEGIN NOW But the bus is too bumpy and sends my pen skittering in senseless directions.  END
BEGIN NOW I put my notebook away and pull out a book, but can’t hardly see the words.  END
BEGIN NOW So back that goes too, and I lean my head against the window.  END
BEGIN NOW The vibrations rattle my brain, and soon I abandon this position. END
BEGIN NOW I’m sitting in a good spot so as to glance.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a cute brunette at the front.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m good at this game.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a shitty game, but I have to be good at something, and apparently I’ve lost the will to masturbate.  END
BEGIN NOW So instead I gaze affectionately at strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW Not straight at them.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s where the game comes in.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of riding the bus is leaning your head against the window.  END
BEGIN NOW If your head isn’t leaned against the window, you’re not actually riding the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW The other part of riding the bus is the fantastic reflections.  END
BEGIN NOW With your face so close to the window, you appear to be looking out.  END
BEGIN NOW This fools your fellow passengers into a relaxed state, and you are free to observe, through the ghost whisper of the window’s reflection.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the game. END
BEGIN NOW Today I’m not actually riding the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW My back is straight.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, slouched.  END
BEGIN NOW But not against the window.  END
BEGIN NOW The brunette has her head cushioned by a knit beanie, leaning against the window.  END
BEGIN NOW But I doubt she knows about the game.  END
BEGIN NOW She wears a pea coat, and she seems on her way home from class, to enjoy soup and crackers or some such nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW At first I examine her from my peripherals.  END
BEGIN NOW Quickly I realize that she’s distracted by something.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a sneaking suspicion as to what it might be, and I deftly execute a brilliant maneuver.  END
BEGIN NOW I look at her reflection in the opposite window instead of at her, and she jumps with electric embarrassment.  END
BEGIN NOW I caught her studying my ghost whisper.  END
BEGIN NOW Secretly observing me.  END
BEGIN NOW I have won the game. END
BEGIN NOW I get off at the next stop feeling clever, mysterious, awkward and stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW Man, what a shitty game.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t even know where I got off.  END
BEGIN NOW Doesn’t matter.  END
BEGIN NOW Space is irrelevant.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now, Time needs movement.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit at the bus stop, waiting for the next bus, and write a little two page story about a kid who gets kicked off the bus because he has an evil sex-leprechaun who keeps yelling dirty things at cute girls.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn sex leprechaun.  END
BEGIN NOW I read through it twice, and hate it.  END
BEGIN NOW I scratch out a line here, circle a phrase there.  END
BEGIN NOW AWK and REWORD and EXPOUND litter the page like graffiti.  END
BEGIN NOW I picture the story written on a bathroom wall.  END
BEGIN NOW I picture gangsters going in with sharpies and critiquing it.  END
BEGIN NOW I like this image.  END
BEGIN NOW I hold onto it, and watch the gangsters, nodding, cradling their chins.  END
BEGIN NOW And just as quick as it came, I become frustrated with it.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s nothing I can do with it! It’s not a story or a song or a painting.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a fucking fantasy about gangsters reworking my piece.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit! I can’t do a damn thing with that. END
BEGIN NOW Deciding to walk, I slip my pad into my back pack and begin my slow trek towards campus.  END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts are made easy with moving feet.  END
BEGIN NOW I can leave them behind with whatever I’m passing.  END
BEGIN NOW The sex leprechaun drops in to the gutter and scuttles off down a storm drain.  END
BEGIN NOW The gangster critics disperse towards the BART station as I cross the street.  END
BEGIN NOW I let the brunette go, and watch her get snagged in a tree, barren of leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Meaningless melodies flitter through now.  END
BEGIN NOW Not actual songs.  END
BEGIN NOW No.  END
BEGIN NOW That would require some sort of attention.  END
BEGIN NOW Some acknowledgement of thought.  END
BEGIN NOW No, it’s just a sort of “Be Diddle Diddle Whop Whop Zang…” Keeping pace with my aimless feet.  END
BEGIN NOW The feeling of relief brought on by my little skat song frustrates me enormously.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s called skat singing because it’s shit! Linguistic doodle poops.  END
BEGIN NOW Scat! Dammit!! END
BEGIN NOW As I continue my trek I slump into the same fucking mind game that keeps crawling in.  END
BEGIN NOW Why the fuck do I bother? I like my sad little poem about my penis.  END
BEGIN NOW But why in God’s name would I write something like that? What does it do? It ain’t gonna save lives.  END
BEGIN NOW It might make someone crack a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess it’s alright.  END
BEGIN NOW I especially like the comparison of colors.  END
BEGIN NOW Rust isn’t quite right, but it’s closer than White…  But who gives a fuck about the color of my penis? That’s sick! This isn’t literature, it’s absolute nonsense! Shit! It’s fucking Shit!! But maybe… maybe it’s just not done yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I could develop it.  END
BEGIN NOW Use the whole white concept as a parallel to the white washed tombs that Jesus compared the Pharisees to.  END
BEGIN NOW Than I could use rust as a symbol of decay and dysfunction.  END
BEGIN NOW Entropy.  END
BEGIN NOW And bring that around to show that we are living a lie unless we acknowledge our flaws.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah… That’s something, right?  …  What the fuck am I even saying? END
BEGIN NOW Why am I trying so hard to write? To create? To leave a sprawling trail of all the words and thoughts that once passed this way.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all shit.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all fucking shit! But then again, maybe it’s supposed to be shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit is a necessary thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you gotta release the shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise it builds up, and that could cause a rupture.  END
BEGIN NOW Or blindness.  END
BEGIN NOW No, masturbation causes blindness.  END
BEGIN NOW What does shit do? I heard somewhere that shit makes the flowers grow.  END
BEGIN NOW I can dig it. END
BEGIN NOW I end up forming a little word game.  END
BEGIN NOW I write for two reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW Either it’s due, or it’s something to do.  END
BEGIN NOW But either way it’s just doo doo.  END
BEGIN NOW According to time, the past is fecal matter, and the future is food. END
BEGIN NOW I tromp along digesting this, satisfied that it’s at least something.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Even Milton and Shakespeare and everyone ever, all the way back to the first guy to put stylus to papyrus.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ve all just been streaking their little chicken feet letterings along like turdstains on toilet paper. END
BEGIN NOW I can’t find an empty page.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh wait, here’s one.  END
BEGIN NOW No, it’s stained through with sharpie.  END
BEGIN NOW And that page has a splattering of resin, where I once gathered the remains of weed smoking that stain the insides of pipes with clumps of black build up.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s smokable, but it gives a real stupid high.  END
BEGIN NOW Like you can’t even watch cartoons.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s shit.  END
BEGIN NOW The shit that weed smoke leaves behind.  END
BEGIN NOW And I scrape it out of my pipe and smoke it to get high.  END
BEGIN NOW Dammit! Shit Everywhere! Even my drugs are just the shit left over from old drugs!  …   I write a quick shitty poem on the resin page… END
BEGIN NOW Resin END
BEGIN NOW Shit END
BEGIN NOW You are what you eat. END
BEGIN NOW This is one of those poems that I’ll never share with anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW I might keep it around, glance at it now and again.  END
BEGIN NOW Remind myself that I disable my true potential.  END
BEGIN NOW But for now I smoke resin.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘cause than I’m stupid, and that means I’ll stop thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what a glorious thought.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again, I feel walkably better, and I continue on my pedestrian way. END
BEGIN NOW As I walk I savor the thought of not thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW I begin counting steps, just so that I’ll have harmless numbers echoing in my skull instead of my melodramatic psycho-philosophical masturbations. END
BEGIN NOW At last I reach the gas station.  END
BEGIN NOW The first pause, the daily greeting, the purchasing of cigarettes and energy drink.  END
BEGIN NOW These motions reassure me.  END
BEGIN NOW I know how to do something.  END
BEGIN NOW This exchange brings me back to feeling functional.  END
BEGIN NOW Something.  END
BEGIN NOW Substantial. END
BEGIN NOW And the sight of the black and white tiling slides me.  END
BEGIN NOW I look up and once again notice that Gas stations, like Safeways, are all the same.  END
BEGIN NOW On a bad one you might forget what town you’re in.  END
BEGIN NOW I glance around, then close my eyes and hear the hum of the drink fridges, and I remember the other place.  END
BEGIN NOW Feugit, California.  END
BEGIN NOW I recently met someone from Feugit.  END
BEGIN NOW A fellow Feugit native.  END
BEGIN NOW A fellow Feugitive.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I guess I’m from Feugit,” he said, “But I do what I can to forget it.” I guess I feel the same sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise why would I be here in Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW I musta said that at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck Feugit.  END
BEGIN NOW Forget it. END
BEGIN NOW But this goddamn gas station sends me there.  END
BEGIN NOW I stare at the back wall, away from the windows, picturing Feugit outside of this station.  END
BEGIN NOW Why Feugit? Why not? What was different? END
BEGIN NOW I do not know… END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 2 Charlie Tomorrow   Feugit, 2003 END
BEGIN NOW Another forgettable slow Saturday afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW Hungover, Shambled.  END
BEGIN NOW I stopped in at the same ol’ fuckin gas station to get some of the ol’ cup o’ noodles.  END
BEGIN NOW They got a big sign out front that says “Same Ol’ Fuckin Gas Station”.  END
BEGIN NOW I love that sign.  END
BEGIN NOW 72 cents left over form the night before, which managed to crawl five or six hours into today, but the guy behind the counter pretended like it was enough for the warm wonderful cup of recovery.  END
BEGIN NOW I walked out of the gas station, to the edge of the parking lot, where the lawn from the park comes up to.  END
BEGIN NOW I wandered across the large field to the swing set.  END
BEGIN NOW I needed something that sways, so as to synch up with the unstable earth still sliding around beneath me. END
BEGIN NOW A little blonde kid with a band aid on his forehead walked up and took the swing next to me, and he just starts talking.  END
BEGIN NOW “My name is Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a Batman action figure.  END
BEGIN NOW My dad says it’s a doll, but it’s not.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s an action figure.” I looked over at Charlie and nodded. END
BEGIN NOW “My dad used to say the same thing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Do you like Batman?” END
BEGIN NOW “Everyone likes Batman.”[Soft Break]“Not my sister.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, but I’ll bet she’s real weird though.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s pretty weird.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you like jokes?” END
BEGIN NOW “Absolutely.” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW “Why? You know a good one?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a knock knock joke.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s hear it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Will you remember me tomorrow?” END
BEGIN NOW “What? Yeah, I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought it was a knock knock joke.” END
BEGIN NOW “It is.  END
BEGIN NOW That comes later though.  END
BEGIN NOW Jes’ keep going.  END
BEGIN NOW Will you remember me in a year?” END
BEGIN NOW “Pro’lly not, I dunno.” END
BEGIN NOW “Just say yes.” He corrected me.  END
BEGIN NOW “Otherwise it doesn’t work.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alrite.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll remember you in a year.” END
BEGIN NOW “Will you remember me in ten years?” END
BEGIN NOW “Without a doubt, Charlie.” END
BEGIN NOW “What about a hundred years?” END
BEGIN NOW “We’ll both be dead than.” My swing stopped.  END
BEGIN NOW I looked over at Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW He had this expression of half frowning concern.  END
BEGIN NOW Dammit, I’m an asshole. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sorry Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I’ll remember you in a hundred years.” But the joke wasn’t funny anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I had showed by cards, let him know I was secretly a grown up.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck! I looked down at my shoes, and he followed my gaze.  END
BEGIN NOW Vans high tops that look like snow boots, still squishy wet from some unnamed escapade from the night before. END
BEGIN NOW “I like your shoes.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks, Charlie.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why are they wet?” END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I fell in the river last night.” END
BEGIN NOW “You can’t remember?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well… I hit my head when I fell.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, and you got nausea?” END
BEGIN NOW “Amnesia.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s right.” We swung in silence for a few minutes, just letting the sun warm us.  END
BEGIN NOW I kicked off my shoes and peeled off my saturated socks.  END
BEGIN NOW I dangled them towards Charlie, threatening to drape them on him.  END
BEGIN NOW He squealed in playful fear.  END
BEGIN NOW “These are goin straight in the trashcan.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re gonna just be barefoot all day?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nah, I’ve got some flip flops in the car.  END
BEGIN NOW How old are you Charlie?” END
BEGIN NOW “Seven an a half.  END
BEGIN NOW How old are you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Twenny… Shit! Oh, I’m sorry Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just, it sounds weird when I say it.  END
BEGIN NOW Twenny.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s alrite.  END
BEGIN NOW My dad swears.  END
BEGIN NOW He says that when he talks about his paycheck.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t seem like twenny.  END
BEGIN NOW You seem like a kid.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Charlie.” It felt good hearing him say that.  END
BEGIN NOW Like I had just received a pardon.  END
BEGIN NOW “You like being a kid?” He picked at the plastic covering the chain of his swing, pondering my query. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW I like being a kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Grown ups are all super worried, and usually about jobs, and money.  END
BEGIN NOW My only job is to collect snails in the garden, and I get a penny a snail.  END
BEGIN NOW They eat the plants.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, being a kid is good.  END
BEGIN NOW My dad is always tired ‘cause he has a job.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t wanna be tired all the time like that.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, when I was a kid all my friends wanted to grow up.  END
BEGIN NOW They couldn’t wait for kindergarten, than they couldn’t wait for middle school, than they couldn’t wait for high school.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew this barefoot guy who was just always barefoot, and he told me about how humans get stuck in this repeated preparation cycle.” END
BEGIN NOW “Repeated prepration?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re smart Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW What, second grade? So you’re getting ready for third grade, and I’ll bet you can’t wait.  END
BEGIN NOW But the way this barefoot guy described it, everyone just keeps getting ready, waiting for the next thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta be ready for high school, ‘cause that’s when things start happening.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta be ready for college, ‘cause that decides your entire future.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta be ready for your twenties, ‘cause you establish your permenant psychological patterns there.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta be ready for your thirties, ‘cause you’ve passed your peak, and therefore it just gets dimmer and lamer from there.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta be ready for your forties and fifties and make sure you have a nice plot of land for your burial, and visit it to make sure they aren’t burying people and then moving them years later to resell the same plot… woah.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry Charlie.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s alright.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t know what most of that meant.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, that’s good.  END
BEGIN NOW But see, I’m just … I dunno, when I was a kid I had some secret knowledge that no one else had. END
BEGIN NOW I could feel it slipping away. END
BEGIN NOW Just a child with my Charlie Brown lunchbox and beanie with a bobbin. END
BEGIN NOW Just a child with my three favorite fears. END
BEGIN NOW Strangers, the dark, and being alone. END
BEGIN NOW Popsicle stains, scraped knees, missing baby teeth. END
BEGIN NOW But I had something more.  END
BEGIN NOW A very special fear neglected by my childhood peers.  END
BEGIN NOW Age. END
BEGIN NOW Even at five I understood that I would one day die and be buried alone in the dark and be dead. END
BEGIN NOW What scared me were the times I couldn’t remember.  END
BEGIN NOW The days that melt together under the lazy summer sun to the point where a month can go by without barely a memory forged.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt that this was the ultimate wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Letting our few precious moments slip by without grabbing a moment, a scar, a memory.  END
BEGIN NOW I tried to savor each moment with impulse and franticness, screaming from action to activity. END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t understand.  END
BEGIN NOW The grown ups, they still don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW Their priorities backwards.  END
BEGIN NOW Who has time for these mortals? Testing our knowledge of numbers and states.  END
BEGIN NOW Stupid Bastards! It’s late! Don’t you hear the bells chiming your swift life away? END
BEGIN NOW So I skipped all my homework, got by on my wits.  END
BEGIN NOW Spent weekends and after school trying to save all the precious few moments authority had left me to live my sweet childhood out it. END
BEGIN NOW And than it was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW All of a sudden I was a senior in High School.  END
BEGIN NOW A Sophmore in community college, morning drunk on a swing in the park, barking at a small blonde boy.  END
BEGIN NOW A senior at Cal, a stumbling hungover, out of the gas station into the sun... END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 3 BELLS    BERKELEY, 2008 END
BEGIN NOW The sun screams down at me, unhindered by my stupid tree.  END
BEGIN NOW I hear the bells KABONG begin to toll.  END
BEGIN NOW A slow chongy KABONG falls hollowly down.  END
BEGIN NOW KABONG I believe that’s three.  END
BEGIN NOW Although KABONG perhaps I missed the first one.  END
BEGIN NOW KABONG I think I heard the first one.  END
BEGIN NOW Which would make this KABONG six? So that means five left? Wait, what KABONG time is it? Alrite, it’s eleven, and that’s seven, unless I missed the first in which KABONG case that makes eight.  END
BEGIN NOW Or nine now.  END
BEGIN NOW KABONG And that would be ten, unless… why do I KABONG care to react so much? It’s the goddamn KABONG bell and nothing more.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not late, but I’m all fidgety now, like I’m supposed to be somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW The bells call me once more, begging me to approach the doors of the church from whence I once crawled to glorious empty freedom… END
BEGIN NOW I feel like I’m late.  END
BEGIN NOW Should I get to the library? No, that’s just my instinct, responding the the bells by approaching the church doors for service.  END
BEGIN NOW The church has been replaced by the towering beast of academia.  END
BEGIN NOW And thus we trade our addictions in for different yet identical direction. END
BEGIN NOW I did the math the other day.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been to over thirty five hundred church services.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a large part of life for quite awhile now.  END
BEGIN NOW Saints Peter and Paul Orthodox Church, been baptized and brought up inside its extended realm.  END
BEGIN NOW I never really questioned or doubted it.  END
BEGIN NOW Belief can sometimes exist the way people share a blanket.  END
BEGIN NOW But now I’m gone, finding my own warmth, mostly from my sweet glorious belly fire that blazes through all hours of the night. END
BEGIN NOW I never chose Orthodoxy.  END
BEGIN NOW I chose not to resist.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, I chose my battles as all angsty questioners will do.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t a nodder.  END
BEGIN NOW I have the horrible habit of stopping people, and asking them why.  END
BEGIN NOW I see many nodders, still nodding away, sharing the beautiful tapestry blanket of belief, religion, and community.  END
BEGIN NOW Not all of them nodders.  END
BEGIN NOW Many talkers.  END
BEGIN NOW Many interested, many expanding, many understanding.  END
BEGIN NOW But I always, every Sunday, had to resist raising my hand during Homily, asking the pontificating priest, “How can finite actions have infinite consequences?” END
BEGIN NOW Even after the sun has gone down, it’s light outside for at least an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW The world is bluish and dim.  END
BEGIN NOW You go in to take a leak, and when you return, it’s black.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s when it feels sudden.  END
BEGIN NOW My excitement and joy for being Christian had long since set, and I wandered through my last bit of high school, and into Junior College in a bluish haze.  END
BEGIN NOW  Then one day I turned around and it was pitch black. END
BEGIN NOW I slouch into the classroom as the teacher starts to talk.  END
BEGIN NOW I puddle into my chair, tossle my hair back out of place, and feel my energy drain like paint dripping down my face.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel like a fraud.  END
BEGIN NOW Flaunting something I obviously don’t have, didn’t know the reading, don’t know what’s due… I hide behind bad hygiene as a way to avoid a relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW My insomnia and supposed craziness, just ways to delay obligation.  END
BEGIN NOW And my ramblings.  END
BEGIN NOW They do nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW And all too much darkening.  END
BEGIN NOW And the teacher drones on… “Harriet Beecher Mutha Fuckin Stowe, Ya’ll!” All I can do is curl forward and try to ignore this guy. END
BEGIN NOW The margins of my notes… I don’t have notes.  END
BEGIN NOW My notes are made up of doodle faces that gaze back with quirky grins, like they know something dark and morbidly hilarious.  END
BEGIN NOW And I’ve drawn it so many times, it’s been driven deep into the rock wall of my mind.  END
BEGIN NOW And now, I see face3s.  END
BEGIN NOW Ones I’ve drawn before.  END
BEGIN NOW When I close my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW In sloppy scribbling intensity.  END
BEGIN NOW I seem to be trailing off again…   And suddenly it’s done.  END
BEGIN NOW Books slap closed, zips and shuffles, and we all gush out the doors as one.  END
BEGIN NOW I quickly find a spot off to the side to catch my breath with some tobacco burnings. END
BEGIN NOW I find a tree near Sproul Plaza, on the lawn.  END
BEGIN NOW A detatched spot to observe the motion.  END
BEGIN NOW The movements of… Them.  END
BEGIN NOW All those passing people who seem to know where they’re going.  END
BEGIN NOW I crouch beneath my tree, light a grit, and scribble down some more meaningless shit… END
BEGIN NOW “I chose this tree because it seemed like the right tree for me to crouch beneath and collect my thoughts as the cute blonde from class walks past.” And I squat there as she passes, holding my hangover before me as my reason for not speaking.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though she lingers, glancing at me.  END
BEGIN NOW And as she passes I notice her pants are staring at me.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially the butt.  END
BEGIN NOW The key is to look busy.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why I doodle.  END
BEGIN NOW And write.  END
BEGIN NOW And play guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW And pop my knuckles and chew my fingernails and find little toys to play with.  END
BEGIN NOW Pebbles to make patterns.  END
BEGIN NOW Sticks to draw in the dirt.  END
BEGIN NOW Rocks to carve into each other.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m occupied.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a seat on the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW My attention is taken.  END
BEGIN NOW Earn it.  END
BEGIN NOW Why must I encroach? Come interrupt me.  END
BEGIN NOW Or leave me be.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t just glance over expectantly. END
BEGIN NOW I chose this tree because it called to me, and I needed a moment of peace.  END
BEGIN NOW Creation.  END
BEGIN NOW Distraction.  END
BEGIN NOW At times the world comes at me in descriptive paragraphs and I need the elongated pause to recover from the onslaught of experience.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t stop to watch the cute blonde from class walk past.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a yellow headband and black silk pants.  END
BEGIN NOW I quickly name her Marie, and decide that one day she’ll marry me.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes, you’ll marry me, Sweet Marie… she wanders on, and everyone she passes pauses long enough to look busy.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes, the curse of beauty.  END
BEGIN NOW The common people are far too intrigued to approach thee, Sweet Marie.  END
BEGIN NOW One day I’m sure you’ll talk to me, and I to thee, Sweet Marie… END
BEGIN NOW Sweet Marie wanders on, and I’m left under my hallowed tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Once she’s gone I’m at liberty to enjoy the actual scenery.  END
BEGIN NOW Sproul Plaza is… Crawling and seething and flyering and screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW And all beneath those silly fuckin trees.  END
BEGIN NOW Invented right here on campus.  END
BEGIN NOW I hate those fuckin trees.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re an existential mockery of what we choose to do with our potential.  END
BEGIN NOW Like absurdist chess pieces, or solders at a wedding, they line the wide path that is Sproul plaza, leading from Telegraph to Sather Gate, under which we find our hero, lying on his back.  END
BEGIN NOW No, not me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m off to the side, under my hallowed tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Our hero is… END
BEGIN NOW Cyco.  END
BEGIN NOW (pronounced Psy-Ko) Or, the upside down cycler.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s doing his art routine.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s hard to explain.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a lot of props; an upside down bike, modified in such a way so that he can lay beneath it and peddle… an invisible rope which he climbs, hoping to get to heaven.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s usually got jammies or a hospital gown on, to which he pins many little painted pieces of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW He has ann umbrella, wildly painted.  END
BEGIN NOW A blanket.  END
BEGIN NOW A towel or two.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s always in the midst of a nonsensical display of true art for art’s sake.  END
BEGIN NOW Swimming in place, or the ritualistic crossing and uncrossing of sticks.  END
BEGIN NOW Or just climbing his invisible rope.  END
BEGIN NOW Pilot goggles.  END
BEGIN NOW Always pilot goggles.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost forgot about that.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears ‘em so often you start to think they’re just his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone knows that.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t need to mention his pilot goggle eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a given. END
BEGIN NOW Today he’s lying on the ground, pawing at the sky, as if he’s swimming, except more floundering, or treading water.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it’s the backfloat.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s got his head under a towel, only his mouth is showing.  END
BEGIN NOW An Asian girl pauses and bends towards him.  END
BEGIN NOW His displaced mouth has a slight grin.  END
BEGIN NOW The Asian girl is extremely perplexed.  END
BEGIN NOW Worried too. END
BEGIN NOW “Excuse me, sir?” She bends towards him, clutching her books to her chest like a bullet proof vest.  END
BEGIN NOW “Sir? Do you need help?” He shakes his head slowly, and swims languidly on through the concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW “Sir?” She obviously didn’t notice him shake his head.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe she doesn’t trust his judgment.  END
BEGIN NOW She seems absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW A caring stone in the midst of the roaring flowing crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW Even the cycler just smiles, and swims on through it. END
BEGIN NOW She looks up and down the stream of people, looking for something to reassure her.  END
BEGIN NOW A white passer by quickly fills her in; “He always does that.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s his art.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t get too close, I hear he has rabies.” The Asian girl hurries on, not looking back and the young white guppie swims up the stream after her.  END
BEGIN NOW For a moment he stops and glances back at the cycler, thinking to himself, END
BEGIN NOW He seems pretty happy with himself.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder if he’s gonna go to heaven for being innocent or hell for being crazy- END
BEGIN NOW Under my tree, I sit and watch, more caught by the people who interact with him, than by the actual hero.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Some memorable lines.  END
BEGIN NOW Once I was clipped by a passing bit of conversation he was spitting.  END
BEGIN NOW A polite student, a nodder, was standing there nodding.  END
BEGIN NOW I almost approached so as to take part in the exchange, but I thought better of it, and sat nearby, so as to overhear. END
BEGIN NOW “The Future is very shakey…” He held his hands out, with the invisible world between them, and he shook it for dramatic effect.  END
BEGIN NOW  “Because it doesn’t exist…” And he pet his invisible cat, and nodded, staring straight into the nodder’s eyes, who stood there nodding back, like a hypnotized pigeon. END
BEGIN NOW I liked it so much I turned it into a poem.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s called… END
BEGIN NOW In Which the Upside-Down Cycler Confronts The Existential Crisis by Providing us with an Example of Action without Meaning, meanwhile paralleling this very action with the question of the Existence of Time END
BEGIN NOW and it goes like this… END
BEGIN NOW The Future is very Shakey,Because it Don’t exist… END
BEGIN NOW Now the key to this piece is the dot dot dot at the end.  END
BEGIN NOW The ampersand.  END
BEGIN NOW Because the poem isn’t over.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s still existing and being experienced, simply because it echoes in your skull cavern, and therefore it can’t end.  END
BEGIN NOW The ampersands of time.  END
BEGIN NOW Such are the days of our lives. END
BEGIN NOW I think I’ve hit another brick wall. END
BEGIN NOW While I’m dribbling out all this nonsense as a way to purge my severely hungover brain, two young black guys approach the upside down cycler.  END
BEGIN NOW They get right up next to him, and point and laugh, enjoying the spectacle.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not in a degrading sort of way.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, not really.  END
BEGIN NOW The cycler doesn’t seem to mind.  END
BEGIN NOW I hear them talk to him.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like “Man, you fuckin crazy!” “Yeah, what the fuck!” One slaps a knee, and they both cackle.  END
BEGIN NOW This response seems the most fitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW This man is hilarious.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not normal.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not a threat to himself or others.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just kinda fuckin hilarious. END
BEGIN NOW And for half a second he represents everything.  END
BEGIN NOW A moment of frantic action with no context, no meaning, no reason.  END
BEGIN NOW He is the ever present essence of existence.  END
BEGIN NOW Why are we here? Because what the fuck else are we gonna do? All action is meaningless without explanation.  END
BEGIN NOW Meaining becomes clouded and lost in language.  END
BEGIN NOW Excessive abstraction alienates the spectator, while a lack therof leaves the spectator swimming in concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW What in God’s name am I saying? I… I can’t follow my own train of thought.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to calm down.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to stop watching this guy.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe his madness is catching… END
BEGIN NOW I find a spot by the fountain.  END
BEGIN NOW A spot to sit and space out.  END
BEGIN NOW This fountain.  END
BEGIN NOW Filled with bubbles, stupid college cliché.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess everyone gets to do it once.  END
BEGIN NOW Or what if the university does it ‘cause that’s how they clean it.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep out the mold and shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Stupid bubbles.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of the fountain slowly crushes all my thoughts, and I’m lost in white noise.  END
BEGIN NOW My mind floats on a clear gray lake.  END
BEGIN NOW Within the sound is a waterfall.  END
BEGIN NOW A very specific waterfall.  END
BEGIN NOW It drops from my mind into my chest.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the waterfall we used to jump from in Big Sur.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s almost dry now.  END
BEGIN NOW This jump is no longer safe, seeing as the landing spot is ankle deep now.  END
BEGIN NOW Some shift in the rivers flow, a logjam up stream, a gush of silt and sand, filling up the gorge swimhole.  END
BEGIN NOW But once and forever more in my mind, from the Big Sur cliffs we’d launch out and fall, thirty forty fifty feet down into the deep gorge waters. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER 4  Big Sur, CA1998 END
BEGIN NOW Big Sur is a campground a couple hours south of Feugit.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve camped there every summer since I can remember with the same twenty or so families from the church, every year.  END
BEGIN NOW We transplant almost the entire block.  END
BEGIN NOW Several blocks.  END
BEGIN NOW There were over 500 people in our church, and maybe 6000 people in Feugit.  END
BEGIN NOW That means we were almost a tenth of the Feugit population.  END
BEGIN NOW Wow.  END
BEGIN NOW Never did that math before.  END
BEGIN NOW Weird. END
BEGIN NOW So we’re at Big Sur, with this church community extension.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s the network of campsites, so we have this huge stomping ground.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop in at the Johnsons and try their blackened salmon.  END
BEGIN NOW At the Patzke’s site they’re serving up fried crawdad.  END
BEGIN NOW One year we caught a gopher snake, and Mister Scheopp killed and cooked it for us. END
BEGIN NOW So it felt like we were still in Ben Lomond, like the walls and protective environment of community was still there.  END
BEGIN NOW It musta been the summer between seventh and eighth grade.  END
BEGIN NOW We were on break.  END
BEGIN NOW And here, in the woods, a bunch of scrappy redneck kids, we were immortal.  END
BEGIN NOW At night we’d still be subject to the minor requirements of our parents.  END
BEGIN NOW “No more cigars! You already had one tonight!” … “No, you can’t go hiking.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just gonna go smoke cigars.” “What do you mean camp on the ridge?!! What do you think we got this campsite for?! No! No camping on the ridge, no night hiking, and no cigars!” END
BEGIN NOW But two or three miles upriver, the silence of nature overwhelms, and even the thought of parental disappointment melts away under the crushing sound of water.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re at the gorge.  END
BEGIN NOW The only approval we need is from each other.  END
BEGIN NOW I pull a backwood cigar and a lighter from their safe stowage of plastic baggy.  END
BEGIN NOW Eli and JP approve.  END
BEGIN NOW We light the cigar, lay back on the rock, and continue to do as little as possible. END
BEGIN NOW The massive slab of obsidian has been soaking up heat since sunrise.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, six hours later, our bodies sprawl out, soaking in the sun, baked by the stinging heat, leaving wet body prints on the rock when we shift, or get up to jump off the rock, ten feet down into the icy shock-water. END
BEGIN NOW Most of the campsites in Big Sur are canopied by the looming redwoods.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun leaking through makes birthmark light-splotches in the shady hall of nature. END
BEGIN NOW There’s really not much to do at the campsite.  END
BEGIN NOW The housewives talk.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids scramble around, find sticks to use as scepters and rocks to use as rubies.  END
BEGIN NOW Most make a voyage to the river at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a huge river.  END
BEGIN NOW At some points you have to swim, at others you can dance across on rocks, from one shore to the other, like footprints on the floor for dance lessons. END
BEGIN NOW The river is inhabited by crawdads, which we often catch and eat.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember walking with my dad and getting bit by one for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a warning snap from it’s cray pincers.  END
BEGIN NOW “There’s something in the water! It Bit me!!” I hollered, crawling up my dad’s leg, trying to get out of the water.  END
BEGIN NOW I was five at the time. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, it’s probably a baby crocodile.” END
BEGIN NOW “There are crocodiles here?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yup.  END
BEGIN NOW Just watch out for the big ones.” My dad always liked to mess with our minds.  END
BEGIN NOW I think maybe my problem is I’m still trying to sort through what’s real and what’s not.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, banana slug goo will melt your hands off if you don’t wash it quick enough? And you have to wash it off with hot sauce.  END
BEGIN NOW And if your hands start burning, that means they’re starting to melt, and you need more hot sauce before it’s too late… END
BEGIN NOW As you hike further up the river away from the campsites, cliff faces rise up on either side.  END
BEGIN NOW Massive boulders are strewn about causing dwarven waterfalls and liliputian bays.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple miles upriver is the gorge.  END
BEGIN NOW The gorge is just about the deepest point in the river.  END
BEGIN NOW At least that I know of.After a wet winter, it can be over twenty feet deep, but it’s usually between ten and fifteen.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s also the point where the river cuts right along the bottom of the cliff that follows the river at a distance.  END
BEGIN NOW A log leans diagonally going twenty or thirty feet up this cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW This is what substitutes as a stairwell.  END
BEGIN NOW There are several ledges reachable from the log.  END
BEGIN NOW A rope hangs from the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Level one is fifteen feet up.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s where you grab the bottom of the rope and swing out, letting go before you swing back in and smoosh yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW Level two is maybe twenty five feet up, and you have access to the rope, but most people just jump out.  END
BEGIN NOW The rope hangs from the tree, which I guess is level three.  END
BEGIN NOW I saw some kid hang from the tree and drop, but I jumped from level four, which is even higher.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to jump over the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW From up there the crags and cliff faces reach out towards your landing spot.  END
BEGIN NOW For most, this is the only cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW The one you can jump off of, and try to count, but you can’t get past two, ‘cause it’s “One one thousand, Two one thousa… Holy fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuuuuuu…” Before you’re interrupted by the water enveloping you, leaving your heels bright red and electrically numb. END
BEGIN NOW On a bad day you’ll get to the gorge and find naked hippies taking pictures of each other.  END
BEGIN NOW On a fine day you’ll find it fairly deserted, almost reserved for you and your posse to horse around.  END
BEGIN NOW On a good day, there will be grown ups and there will be beer.  END
BEGIN NOW At least in their stomachs.  END
BEGIN NOW And there will be rednecks having flashbacks to their teenage years.  END
BEGIN NOW I can still see them, all drunk, open Coors in hand, scaling the cliff, reaching the top, and trying to muster a double gainer.  END
BEGIN NOW A crowd spreads across the rocks, chanting “Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!” He inches towards the ledge, scans the crowds, catches every cute chick’s eye, takes a final chug, and finally pushes himself off into the air, END
BEGIN NOW hurtling, it’s a half gainer… a little farther, it’s a full one… another half, almost there, but you can see he’s gonna land wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW You wanna close your eyes, look away, but you watch as *SMACK* like a bird hitting a window.  END
BEGIN NOW Any other landing besides feel first or diving, the sound is a thick raw slap.  END
BEGIN NOW A hunk of liver on a marble floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Watching him crawl out of the shallows, his torso pinker than his sunburned back… it makes your own torso tingle just under the skin, a flashback to misfired flips ending in similar fashion. END
BEGIN NOW This particular year, I was, what, twelve? Thirteen? Anyways.  END
BEGIN NOW We lay on this rock, basking and drying, leaving our wet spots.  END
BEGIN NOW Every few minutes we’d crack an eyelid and watch a body hurtle downwards, usually accompanied by a loudly screamed profanity.  END
BEGIN NOW Quality entertainment.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the ritual.  END
BEGIN NOW Fairly common, I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW To lay in the sun until all the energy is fried and sucked out of your bodies, than flopping off the rock into the river, the crisp freezing water.  END
BEGIN NOW Soothes the burning body like nothing else.  END
BEGIN NOW I was about to flop into the water like a dead burnt fish when JP jumped up. END
BEGIN NOW “Who’s jumpin with me!?!” You could hear the frantic stretching edge in his voice, trying to sound hyped up, but unable to completely mask his terror.  END
BEGIN NOW Yup, he meant the big cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW I cracked an eye and looked at him. END
BEGIN NOW JP was the fat kid.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t huge.  END
BEGIN NOW And since then he’s turned it around and become a ball of testosterone soaked muscle.  END
BEGIN NOW But back than at about one thirty, he pudged out like nothing standing next to us ninety pounders.  END
BEGIN NOW He was the guy at the back of the pack when we ran.  END
BEGIN NOW I was back there with him ‘cause I hated running.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always at the bottom of the dog pile, which was perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW Something soft to land on if your elbow drop victim dodges.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always at the bottom of the tree when we climbed.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the very bottom, but we never thought it safe for him to come all the way to the top where the trunk is as thick as your wrist and the branches are as thin as your fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and he was the nicest guy on the planet.  END
BEGIN NOW Still is as far as I know.  END
BEGIN NOW But he’d never outdone me.  END
BEGIN NOW I could run faster, jump higher, dive deeper, and brag longer than he ever could.  END
BEGIN NOW And now, here he is, standing up, about to hurl himself from the highest cliff in the universe, into the water, with full knowledge that I’m too scared to.  END
BEGIN NOW What an asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m the outdoer.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s the outdone.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, that’s not true at all.  END
BEGIN NOW But back than it was. END
BEGIN NOW I watched in stupefied wonder as he and, who was it? Jeff maybe? Eli? Or maybe it was Rachel.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, the two of them got up, and cheered at each other for a moment before heading off to scale the cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW Strange urges to scale after them arose in me, but I wasn’t gonna give in to the mad whim for at least another year.  END
BEGIN NOW I looked up at JP perched atop the cliff peeking over the edge, his eyes big and goggled.  END
BEGIN NOW He stepped back and my heart slowed. END
BEGIN NOW “Man,” I said to no one, “I knew he’d wimp out.” But then all at once, as if some pulley had snapped in his brain, he ran towards the edge and hurtled himself off.  END
BEGIN NOW Iwatched his facial expression evolve with the fall.  END
BEGIN NOW At first, while running towards, it was a set face of fierce determination.  END
BEGIN NOW As his foot left the cliff, there was a glimpse of horror, a sudden realization of fact, and that expression quickly blossomed into a wailing scream.  END
BEGIN NOW In several falling seconds, he disappeared into the water with a much smaller splash than expected, and popped up a few seconds later, sputtering yelling and laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW I just stared at him, confused.  END
BEGIN NOW Not understanding.  END
BEGIN NOW Why had it worked for him? I’d been up there before, looking down, but I hadn’t …  why had it worked for him? END
BEGIN NOW It was the next year when I finally took the jump.  END
BEGIN NOW Or course there was a girl involved.  END
BEGIN NOW A nameless background sort of girl.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d hiked up there to find Eli, but there being a lack of Eli, I talked to cutie. END
BEGIN NOW “What’s up.” END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Mikey, wanna jump with me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Huh, wha? … Yeah! Ok, of Course! No problem.  END
BEGIN NOW You scared? I’m not.” While I stood there sputtering, she made her way off towards the cliff, and I was forced to follow before I could … really, decide to go along with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Scaling the cliff was easy.  END
BEGIN NOW I can climb.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m good at keeping my grip in situations.  END

BEGIN NOW But when you’re supposed to just kinda fling yourself out there? What the hell is that?! Maybe three or four minutes of scrambling up nearly vertical trail, and then a glance down from the top, and your brain zooms in and pulls back, and you gotta look up at the sky, ‘cause that’s always the same distance.

BEGIN NOW The girl glanced back at me and giggled.  END
BEGIN NOW The bitch giggled.  END

BEGIN NOW I stood up there, feeling totally mocked by that goddamn giggle.  END
BEGIN NOW I stood up there, ten or fifteen minutes, contemplating my mortality.  END
BEGIN NOW The gorge was packed.  END
BEGIN NOW Catcalls, drunks hollering up, “”Jump!” Madness.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to crawl back down the cliff, tail between my legs.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to not have to do this ever, and not have to pretend like… END

BEGIN NOW It’s still written on a bathroom stall, but this time it’s in a hip chain of coffee shops that I start with my amazing poetic genius.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee shop is called “Poetic Genius” and the sex-leprechaun story is written on all the bathroom stalls in all the Poetic Genius coffee shops across America, and gangsters and hipsters and street prophets and goobers rework it with their sharpies while they shit in my coffee house bathrooms, all across America.

BEGIN NOW This is all I can manage… END
BEGIN NOW I get up from the fountain and wander off towards Shattuck, passing over the thick metal hatchway that leads to the steam tunnels.  END

BEGIN NOW Perhaps one day, when I’m old and crazy, I’ll crawl down there and break into the library. END

BEGIN NOW  I been there.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the steam tunnels, not here, no.  END
BEGIN NOW And not with no friggin cell phones.  END
BEGIN NOW It was true darkness, the kind that leaks into your eyes and makes you feel every sound not just in your ears, but in your elbows and your chest. END
BEGIN NOW The tunnel was just wide enough to touch both walls at once, the roof a similar distance, just barely within reach.  END
BEGIN NOW This gave us comfort.  END
BEGIN NOW Knowledge of our lightless realm.  END
BEGIN NOW Mere proportions, but comforting nonetheless.  END
BEGIN NOW The water was up to our knees now, and we’d been walking through the pitch black for so long, it felt natural.  END
BEGIN NOW Benjamin Raymond yodeled with delight as his next step took him two inches deeper. END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure whose idea it was.  END
BEGIN NOW When we hang out this kinda thing just occurs.  END
BEGIN NOW We found the river flowing casually out of the tunnel down the beach to the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW We both just sat down, took our shoes and socks off, and wandered in.  END
BEGIN NOW The walls were concrete, but the riverbed was loose rocks.  END
BEGIN NOW “You still counting steps?” END
BEGIN NOW “Aint much else to do in this darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m up to ninety six.” END
BEGIN NOW “Makes sense.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m at ninety two, and you’re about four steps ahead of me.” END
BEGIN NOW “I thought I was behind you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Guh… hick! Begaaah! Guh!” Benny ray started making sounds guttural and squawking.  END
BEGIN NOW The echoing tunnel made it sound like there was a tribe of boojums around us, waiting to strike. END
BEGIN NOW B-Ray is a dispenser.  END
BEGIN NOW Whether it’s high pitched yodeling into a dumpster or one liners litered with lireary reference, “I dub thee narcissus oxymandias mariner…” He owns every moment he’s part of, and laughs spastically at the slightest provocation.  END
BEGIN NOW He writes when he wants to, and I’ve never decided how I feel about that.  END
BEGIN NOW He uses crazy crazy words.  END
BEGIN NOW Laconically, pedantically, he spreads his sesquipidelian pontifications prodigiously and yet lackadaisically.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaves quotes in and on my notebook.  END
BEGIN NOW “This is the spoot rag for your divine beauty.” Scrawled across one of my janky little journals.  END
BEGIN NOW You could call him the quintessential child of the ADD generation. END
BEGIN NOW Brilliant Haikus.  END
BEGIN NOW Short stories could use some work.  END
BEGIN NOW Novel? Well, he’s like the manifesto go to guy.  END
BEGIN NOW A manifesto for every situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Historians write novels.  END
BEGIN NOW He is the historian of the ever thriving experience of right the fuck now. END
BEGIN NOW Vonnegut said it best: “...  END
BEGIN NOW a roman candle of a man.” His personality, presence, and the shock of blonde hair tossling into the sky Taller than you or me, enthusiastic about nothing in particular, and every possible particular.  END
BEGIN NOW He especially likes the strange little details ignored by you and eye. END
BEGIN NOW A few days ago he sent me a text... END
BEGIN NOW << a nearly blind autistic man just befriended me by wanting to sell me headphones and a voice recorder for ten bucks.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn't need them but wanted to support him, so I bought them.  END
BEGIN NOW He's now telling me the instruments he plays and what his parents do.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a fanny pack and amazes me so>> END
BEGIN NOW It took him two messages to send, but he knows how important permanizing is and takes the necessary steps.  END
BEGIN NOW In for sentences he tells a story short strong and strange. END
BEGIN NOW Six years ago, I lost my virginity at his birthday party.  END
BEGIN NOW It was the third day of his party, because his birthday kinda permeates into the following days.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not over 'til you're hung over.  END
BEGIN NOW A bad rule for Olympiad drinkers. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Benny Ray, how long's it been dark?” END
BEGIN NOW “I'd say since puburty.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's just an estimate.  END
BEGIN NOW No, let's see now.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm at a hundred a twenty three, taking maybe a step every second and a half...” END
BEGIN NOW “Hang on, hang on...  END
BEGIN NOW that's...  END
BEGIN NOW half of ...  END
BEGIN NOW fifty, and twelve, and hun...  END
BEGIN NOW Hundred and eighty five!” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, it's been more like ten minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad estimates.  END
BEGIN NOW Hundred and twenty nine...  END
BEGIN NOW  wait! THERE!! OH MY GOD!!!!” END
BEGIN NOW “I SEE IT!!! IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!” END
BEGIN NOW “Ehacka hacka hacka...  END
BEGIN NOW It's the light! The light!!” We hooted, I heard little splashes as he danced around.  END
BEGIN NOW No visuals at all, except a little smudgy pin prick of yellow that kept disappearing and replicating itself as after image... END
BEGIN NOW Slowly, ever so...  END
BEGIN NOW It became less black.  END
BEGIN NOW A soft gray glowing around the yellow speck.  END
BEGIN NOW To the left and the right still complete oblivion.  END
BEGIN NOW The edges, the tiny mouth, the walls crawling towards us with illumination.  END
BEGIN NOW Distant scrambled graffitti scrawl...  END
BEGIN NOW to the left and right hints of texture now.  END
BEGIN NOW Flecks of color.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps these walls hidden from exposure hide the truly permanized art, hidden away from the sun and the eyes and the whitewash and disapproval.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe it's just bat-shit. END
BEGIN NOW Finally we emerged. END
BEGIN NOW “A hundred and seventy eight steps.  END
BEGIN NOW That's at least a hundred steps through the total pitch darkness in knee deep water.” END
BEGIN NOW “and...  END
BEGIN NOW why? Did we, do that?” END
BEGIN NOW “Look at where we are!” We'd come out in a deep gully.  END
BEGIN NOW A fallen but living oak tree reclined across, stretched out on a massive bed of brambles.  END
BEGIN NOW We scrambled up onto the oak tree's horizontal trunk, ten feet above the water, surveying our new habitat.  END
BEGIN NOW Primordial it was.  END
BEGIN NOW Greenery teeming and keeping us pinned.  END
BEGIN NOW Steeped in the natural innocence of things untouched by man.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though we'd taken the concrete conduit, the river was completely overgrown further on.  END
BEGIN NOW To continue we'd have been crawling upstream, our bellies in the water and brambles in our hair.  END
BEGIN NOW The trunk, our living bench, stretched along creating a catwalk from one steep brambled hillside to the other.  END
BEGIN NOW But no escape except the way we came. END
BEGIN NOW So he shows up, once again, on his birthday, ready to remind me that it's all right to die a little bit sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW October second, he shares his birthday with Ghandi and Groucho.  END
BEGIN NOW Such a duo of predecessors and you're bound to have your uniquenesses.  END
BEGIN NOW He showed up on the second, and left on the sixth, catching his bus back to Feugit at seven in the AM.  END
BEGIN NOW He got the jump on his hangover by waking up drunk, and meeting up with Tequila toting relatives, narrowly avoiding the headache that would symbolize for him the end of his birthday celebration. END
BEGIN NOW That afternoon, when I finally woke, I sat on my stoop and watched a little Mexican girl run around the parking lot, grabbing all the loose newspaper and hugging it to her face like a teddy bear.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I said that wrong, because when I saw it, I was appeased and cured.  END
BEGIN NOW And she ran off and tucked it away somewhere, and came back for more.  END
BEGIN NOW As she passed close to me, she looked at me sideways and said something in childish Spanish, the words were smeared in the wind like watercolors. END
BEGIN NOW The best sound in the world is four year old Spanish, END
BEGIN NOW especially when it comes from a sideways smile. END
BEGIN NOW My door stays closed for the most part, as do my windows and face.  END
BEGIN NOW But when Benny Ray blew through for his birthday, he opened everything up and placed himself in the doorway like some sort of hero, perched on the edge of experience.  END
BEGIN NOW The day before he left we went through three and half twelve packs between us.  END
BEGIN NOW I lay curled on the couch, beer number twenty something threatening to drop from my slackened grip.  END
BEGIN NOW B-ray looking into the outside like an astronaut philosopher, wondering what he's about to do. END
BEGIN NOW “It's dark.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah B-Ray, it's night.” END
BEGIN NOW “I didn't expect it to be dark when I woke up.” END
BEGIN NOW “We passed out while the neighbors ate their early dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course you wake up at night.” END
BEGIN NOW “Shut up, fucker! When you sleep you don't interact with time.  END
BEGIN NOW So when you first wake up, time doesn't exist.  END
BEGIN NOW It's just the morning of your mind.” END
BEGIN NOW “the morning of your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW I like that.  END
BEGIN NOW You gonna write it down?” END
BEGIN NOW “No.”[Soft Break]“Fucker.” END
BEGIN NOW His eyes scanned the moonlit lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Cars peppered the spaces.  END
BEGIN NOW An extended Mexican family (blood or not I don't know) extended down the sidewalk of the complex.  END
BEGIN NOW A large white woman struggled up the stairs on the left, squeezing past a pile of broken furniture. END
BEGIN NOW “Michael, you live in a box of oddities.” END
BEGIN NOW “you have no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a neighbor you've never met that will send your mind reeling.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy...  END
BEGIN NOW he made me start caring about myself again.” END
BEGIN NOW “That's fucking huge! This guy must be amazing!” END
BEGIN NOW “He's the only company I've had for awhile, and you're more than a relief.  END
BEGIN NOW Even you would be hard pressed to appreciate...  END
BEGIN NOW The Moth.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why is he called the Moth?” END
BEGIN NOW “He only comes and visits when he sees the kitchen light is on.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ooooh! That's why you keep your kitchen dark! You're fuckin twisted.” I handed Ben a crumpled page, and he began to read... END
BEGIN NOW THE MOTH POEM END
BEGIN NOW Moths are Beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Moths are Blind. END
BEGIN NOW Moths are Delicate, and nobody loves them. END
BEGIN NOW “Is that it? That tells me nothing! What the fuck! What is this guy? It's all so intriguing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yes, I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm toying with your emotions. END
BEGIN NOW “So tell me about this creature of yours.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, he used to scare me.  END
BEGIN NOW And now, I wish he still scared me.  END
BEGIN NOW Because when you're scared of someone you don't fucking care.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't think about the inside of their head.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I look at him slouched on my couch, and feel like maybe he's dead.  END
BEGIN NOW His front teeth are still good.  END
BEGIN NOW No, not good.  END
BEGIN NOW There.  END
BEGIN NOW His front teeth are there.  END
BEGIN NOW They are gross, and the only ones he has left.” END
BEGIN NOW “When you say Moth, do you mean Meth?” END
BEGIN NOW “Dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW He says crack and I don't know the difference.  END
BEGIN NOW Seems to have the same outcome.  END
BEGIN NOW Hollowed out bug eyed scratchy faced toothless tattooed friendless choking hacking laugh that seems to have something I don't.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's cause he's scorched out his skull and is left with this simplicity that baffles me.  END
BEGIN NOW He's got this jawbone that juts out like a diving board, especially when he's been smoking crack.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's when his lips go in and out of the crack pipe pucker.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why are you telling me about this guy?” END
BEGIN NOW “Because I feel obligated to.  END
BEGIN NOW Because he exists dramatically and passively.  END
BEGIN NOW Naturally and freakish.  END
BEGIN NOW Cared for and incompetent.  END
BEGIN NOW He is.  END
BEGIN NOW He must be pointed at.  END
BEGIN NOW I apologize to him for pointing, but the world needs to fucking know what happens and why.  END
BEGIN NOW He's a biproduct of a flawed system.  END
BEGIN NOW A symptom of national madness.  END
BEGIN NOW A child of broken America. END
BEGIN NOW “If I don't jot this shit down and impress upon others this guy's existence, he'll disappear without a trace.  END
BEGIN NOW And the heavy dark truth that he embodies will go on unhindered. END
BEGIN NOW “i know this isn't exactly a stellar moment of memory, but he's there, up on the second floor, and this here is proof of it.  END
BEGIN NOW This stupid little poem.  END
BEGIN NOW And he's got these horribly morbid haikus.  END
BEGIN NOW Just shit he says in conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW I write them down after he leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks he's just talking, which he might be, but once I write it down, it's a morbid haiku.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well let's hear one.” END
BEGIN NOW “They're not normal haikus.  END
BEGIN NOW 5-7-5? Not so much.” END
BEGIN NOW “Didn't really expect those standards to be met.  END
BEGIN NOW Not coming from you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, this one's kinda fucked up... END
BEGIN NOW I got a busted ear from my daddy. END
BEGIN NOW He used to beat me up real bad, END
BEGIN NOW But he's still my best friend. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, that's fucked.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, he's got a gnarly batch of backstories.  END
BEGIN NOW Just his list of medications would make a poem.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll have to try that later.” END
BEGIN NOW “Let's hear another one.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.  END
BEGIN NOW This one int quite done, but it gets the point across... END
BEGIN NOW Banana Now and Laters END
BEGIN NOW Are Great END
BEGIN NOW For when you're craving drugs. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright Mikey, no more.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all too real.  END
BEGIN NOW He's taking images from my youth and tainting them with crack resin.  END
BEGIN NOW So you gonna do a character study?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, prolly just a collection of morbid haikus.  END
BEGIN NOW He's hard to think about.  END
BEGIN NOW Hurts my soul.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I hear ya.  END
BEGIN NOW I always had better luck with drunks.  END
BEGIN NOW Like Rockin Mark.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck yeah! Remember his theories on how the universe works?” We both took long slow sips of beer and started trading Rockin Mark one liners. END
BEGIN NOW Rockin Mark is in the permanent collection.  END
BEGIN NOW He's not on tour anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Last I heard he shaved his scraggle beard, cut his mangle gray hair and started goin to church.  END
BEGIN NOW First time I saw him he was at the bus stop, tellin me about how girls wear nailpolish because it gets them high.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a fat glob of it on the tip of his nose, all bright glittery green. END
BEGIN NOW Through our late teens and early twenties we'd find him rocking out in the Ben Lomond Park or by the Covered Bridge or behind one of the churches.  END
BEGIN NOW He lived in various places.  END
BEGIN NOW There are a few horse pastures where we'd hike with our booze, and we'd sometimes find him perched on a fallen tree, jammin on guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW He used to camp behind the gold dome church, but I guess they kicked him out.  END
BEGIN NOW Heartless bastards.  END
BEGIN NOW As if God was bothered. END
BEGIN NOW Rockin Mark is always on.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he'd have a crazy crazy story to tell.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes all beady through his oversized glasses would slide around back and forth like goldfish filled with mercury. END
BEGIN NOW “Look at my bandages.  END
BEGIN NOW I set myself on fire the other day.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a long story, let me explain.” It was a very long involved story.  END
BEGIN NOW First, cleaning his pipe with rubbing alcohol, spilling the rubbing alcohol on his lap, and a little while later, sparking a pot pipe, and in the process the fumes and thus himself, two tall cans and a half gallon of grape juice to appease the flames, and finally when that failed, two kind hearted Indians on motorcycles, long hair flailing in the wind, noticing his condition and putting him out. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he'd be in rock mode and jam on guitar, interspersing his riffs with little one liners... END
BEGIN NOW “I don't wanna chop down any of these mountains, I love 'em!” He points to the sky with his middle finger.  END
BEGIN NOW Not out of anarchist rebellion, but because he lost his pointer finger.  END
BEGIN NOW Mighta been frostbite.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember.  END
BEGIN NOW But he'd also show his toes, or lack thereof, to the girls to make 'em shriek. END
BEGIN NOW A battery powered amp, no bigger than a breadbox.  END
BEGIN NOW A voice like the gravel he pees in every morning.  END
BEGIN NOW “Don't wanna leave a puddle.” Clever guy.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely bonkers.  END
BEGIN NOW He sounds like his voice is coming from a sewer grating.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a ballcap with a strawhat perched on top.  END
BEGIN NOW One flannel, one windbreaker, one leather, all worn and grunged and almost bonded together.  END
BEGIN NOW He started telling us about how the universe works...  END
BEGIN NOW “Lemme explain something to you beautiful people...” Than he listed names.  END
BEGIN NOW “There was Buckminister Fuller, Nicole Tessler, and Einstein.” He glances down and begins examining his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW A sloppy unfinished pentagram tattoo on the back of his left hand, a Dream catcher around his neck...  END
BEGIN NOW “No, Lemme start over.” He continues.  END
BEGIN NOW “It's like a giant game of tinker toys, except with extra balls, extra sticks, and probably beer money.” We were all the more enraptured, because he seemed completely sure of himself.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd been thinking about this, and knew exactly what he was talking about.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck the rest of the world.  END
BEGIN NOW They'll never catch on.  END
BEGIN NOW It makes sense to him, and that's good enough.  END
BEGIN NOW I still wonder about the tinker toys thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that's the key to true understanding... END
BEGIN NOW Prolly not though. END
BEGIN NOW Rockin Mark is one of the many.  END
BEGIN NOW He holds more beauty than most, and B-Ray is one of the few who can ...  END
BEGIN NOW  ot quantify, but clarify, expose these things.  END
BEGIN NOW Benny Ray showed me where to find the secrets; the details that save souls. END
BEGIN NOW He talks to strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW All friggin day long.  END
BEGIN NOW When we ride the bus together, Benny Ray finds some stranger to approach.  END
BEGIN NOW Interrogate.  END
BEGIN NOW Encourage.  END
BEGIN NOW Entertain.  END
BEGIN NOW Interaction seems to justify itself. END
BEGIN NOW That's why I dig it.  END
BEGIN NOW 'cause I'm terrified of strangers, and I get to watch him, totally unaware of the danger he's in.  END
BEGIN NOW Strangers?!?! They have diseases! And sad stories they want to tell you! And confusing questions that you can't answer without offending someone! And than they'll leave you and you'll be alone and than it just gets darker and emptier and colder. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 6 VIRGINIA AVENUE Berkeley, 2009 END
BEGIN NOW It's dark and empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Virginia Avenue is vacant.  END
BEGIN NOW The wet asphalt gives the wind's edge a biting smack.  END
BEGIN NOW It peels my eyes back like sardine lids.  END
BEGIN NOW A bit of a back and forth drawl down the emptiness.  END
BEGIN NOW There's a clarity I find right around midnight.  END
BEGIN NOW Like I finally taste my breath for the first time in the day.  END
BEGIN NOW My eyes don't scan the ground, avoiding possible contact.  END
BEGIN NOW My hands don't fiddle and scratch, and my feet don't hurry homeward. END
BEGIN NOW It's dark and empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else is warm inside.  END
BEGIN NOW This night, this is proof.  END
BEGIN NOW Of what I'm not sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps that this remembrance is due.  END
BEGIN NOW This soft shrinking of skin seems to bring my insides closer to my surroundings somehow. END
BEGIN NOW ...  END
BEGIN NOW I gotta quit smokin pot.  END
BEGIN NOW My words are pounded out like stuttering mud bricks from a conveyor.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't think right anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW A little math, against a tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Two forties, three bowls and a beer makes eighty twelve ounces and maybe a gram.  END
BEGIN NOW Ninety two.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm almost home.  END
BEGIN NOW These are good numbers.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad numbers that remind me that I must be in a good mood.  END
BEGIN NOW The tally mark, the farcical score card.  END
BEGIN NOW How much of you is left? The fraction of self still alive is inversely proportionate to the amount consumed tonite. END
BEGIN NOW It's gonna be a long one.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm home and it doesn't seem to be slowing.  END
BEGIN NOW Rather it kicks into gear.  END
BEGIN NOW Little planes doing dog fights behind my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Whirring hum rumble, you know the tune.  END
BEGIN NOW The human mind magma pulsating inside your face... END
BEGIN NOW My bed sits in the corner, reminiscent of a funeral pyre.  END
BEGIN NOW A mess of journals, piles torn and wrinkled lined paper skirting the edge of the bedpyre like kindling.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't even sit on the bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside the design, there's no way to see what you're part of.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead I pull up a milk crate and start shuffling through the crumpled results of my most recent writing binge. END
BEGIN NOW ...  END
BEGIN NOW It's Nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW  ...  END
BEGIN NOW Dark and Miserable Nonsense... END
BEGIN NOW I dig it out nonetheless and subject myself to its perusal. END
BEGIN NOW There's something in me.  END
BEGIN NOW Some sort of frantic energy that needs to get out.  END
BEGIN NOW Even as I'm typing, I stop and study my hands.  END
BEGIN NOW That left pinky nail could be chewed down further without too much pain.  END
BEGIN NOW I pop my knuckles and tap my fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW I wriggle my toes as if I were somehow tied down.  END
BEGIN NOW I always feel like it's time to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW Or walk.  END
BEGIN NOW Or just move.  END
BEGIN NOW One room to the next and back to the first.  END
BEGIN NOW What was I doing? Oh, just nervous pacing.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe my calmness is in the next room? Some sort of contentedness with my self and what I'm doing? Going from inert rut to stagnant air pocket, held down by my lack of gumption, yet tormented by this smoldering pocket of energy that keeps my sternum ablaze and chews at the walls of my brain.  END
BEGIN NOW  Immobilized by lethargy while plagued by feelings of entropy.  END
BEGIN NOW My thoughts grow stale and mold inside my head.  END
BEGIN NOW How much have I wasted and forgotten? How much lies in the back closet waiting for me to take advantage, release myself on society? All I need to do is calm the Fuck down. END
BEGIN NOW Well, that was a fun little piece.  END
BEGIN NOW There seems to be this obsession with the self, personal potential, and the guilt that comes from burning it.  END
BEGIN NOW The easy thing would be to label it a slow lifelong reaction to the dysfunctions found in Christian Fundamentalism.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe pair that up with a nice psychological breakdown stemming from the whole Xenophobe Infectious-Gentile mindset that this seems to grow from.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't like this.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't enjoy these things. END
BEGIN NOW There was this stupid pun I wrote once about how I burned my chicken fingers on her stove.  END
BEGIN NOW It's about how cowardice combined with ignorance results in the coward suddenly becoming aware of the strange burn - the ...  END
BEGIN NOW the coward.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying too hard, assuming some sort of optimistic fatalism... END
BEGIN NOW What happened to my optimistic fatalism? I used to think I was doomed to succeed.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I feel like I'm destined to not quite make it but come just right up to the edge.  END
BEGIN NOW There must be some moment hidden in this paper streak, some moment where I start the piece as one person and end the piece as another. END
BEGIN NOW my mind is mine...  END
BEGIN NOW it's a fuck of a toy.  END
BEGIN NOW Magical and pitiful, END
BEGIN NOW Indquisitive and feotal.  END
BEGIN NOW Paralyzed and hyperactive. END
BEGIN NOW My forehead lines crawl along, skin ditches dug with morbid songs. END
BEGIN NOW Like your face in the snow, a nosedive is all. END
BEGIN NOW Like a smack from a brick with your lips. END
BEGIN NOW And I fall into nowhere. END
BEGIN NOW The dark unlit room comes along.  END
BEGIN NOW The secret demon that rapes me END
BEGIN NOW and tightens my jaw screws like ecstasy. END
BEGIN NOW It does this a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Mine mind.  END
BEGIN NOW You know into the sky, the snow. END
BEGIN NOW And right when it's right? When I like it at night, it careens into caverns END
BEGIN NOW With vulture beak logic.  END
BEGIN NOW The dead and the edible. END
BEGIN NOW Vulture beak, speak to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Food killed by you is too good. END
BEGIN NOW You prefer leftovers basted in mud. END
BEGIN NOW You prefer bug eyed nail biting twitches. END
BEGIN NOW The lost, the forgotten, the meaningless words. END
BEGIN NOW The things that rattle out, the dark secrets told by sad little birds. END
BEGIN NOW The logic that might make it into the novel.  END
BEGIN NOW The logic that hates me. END
BEGIN NOW The logic that creates my fantasy.  END
BEGIN NOW What doesn't want to stop. END
BEGIN NOW The engine running backwards, slowing my potential END
BEGIN NOW The inability to be.  END
BEGIN NOW To be me.  END
BEGIN NOW To see what's sitting next to me END
BEGIN NOW With the sweetest grin you'll ever see. END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I look up from my mud stained shoes, END
BEGIN NOW condemn my dark logic, abolish my blues. END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I just look up and grin anymore?[Soft Break]Why does it all taste of sin more and more? END
BEGIN NOW I let it slide in.  END
BEGIN NOW My angry sad magic. END
BEGIN NOW Potential for tragic, the part of me, that once was left behind. END
BEGIN NOW Here it is, the me that I hate.  END
BEGIN NOW The I forgot for so long. END
BEGIN NOW The one that would run and take shelter in my shoes END
BEGIN NOW Every time I saw you. END
BEGIN NOW The half of me that hates sanity. END
BEGIN NOW When first you approached, I held it back. END
BEGIN NOW Suppressed my demon potential, curbed by sad tragic knack. END
BEGIN NOW Now bound, we seem to be, I approach the parts that I don't want to see. END
BEGIN NOW Displayed like a gypsy yard sale, I make your cheeks pale END
BEGIN NOW with heavy faced morbidness, logic of doom. END
BEGIN NOW I've dragged you into my darkened mind room.  END
BEGIN NOW [Soft Break]Ybut you won't find the lights for me. END
BEGIN NOW It's these parts I've never let you seem. END
BEGIN NOW My darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad half.  END
BEGIN NOW The part that should die. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's gone unapproached til tonite. END
BEGIN NOW The part I never learned to control. END
BEGIN NOW The big nasty cyst on the inside of my soul. END
BEGIN NOW And I must expunge it before I can claim to fit. END
BEGIN NOW I shit on your grins for letting stranger in. END
BEGIN NOW These thoughts are not for you. END
BEGIN NOW This is me letting it all fall away. END
BEGIN NOW Face encrusted with self obsessed sadness mud. END
BEGIN NOW Into the snow I go, to wash it away. END
BEGIN NOW To let my face show. END
BEGIN NOW Changing patterns. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing under Chinese Lanterns... END
BEGIN NOW Chinese lanterns? Fuck that piece.  END
BEGIN NOW Some cheesy tacky “Take Me Back” Bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW I need balance.  END
BEGIN NOW Where's the angry shit? Enough of this sorry sad mopey cheese... END
BEGIN NOW This guy is all about climbing up balconies and playing ballads on the lute, and preforming death defying feats to prove his love.  END
BEGIN NOW He meets this chick.  END
BEGIN NOW Starts to pursue her.  END
BEGIN NOW She likes him at first, 'cause all girls respond to attention.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess guys do too.  END
BEGIN NOW But than she gets weirded out by his intense behavior.  END
BEGIN NOW He keeps pursuing her, playing songs on her answering machine, writing her long love letters, leaving her flowers at work, in her mailbox, hurled over her fence...  END
BEGIN NOW So finally she gets a restraining order against him.  END
BEGIN NOW He may or may not have some dark back-story about criminal activity and her being part of some sort of sting operation without even knowing it.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven't finished that part yet. END
BEGIN NOW So he's at the bottom of her balcony playing his lute, and she comes to the window, yells at him for a second,and calls the cops.  END
BEGIN NOW She tells him, but he keeps playing.  END
BEGIN NOW He means to prove. END
BEGIN NOW Four cop cars come screeching up, two from each direction.  END
BEGIN NOW At the sound of the sirens, our hero glances around frantically, and begins scaling the lattice that leads up to her balcony.  END
BEGIN NOW The cop cars all pull E-breakers, and smash into each other.  END
BEGIN NOW The cops stumble out all shaken up.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them are bleeding.  END
BEGIN NOW They look very disheveled and dizzy.  END
BEGIN NOW Our hero hangs by one hand and spins around to get a view.  END
BEGIN NOW He hoots and cheers with laughter.  END
BEGIN NOW Does she cheer? Does she talk shit to him? She glances down, not feeling threatened, but a bit annoyed by him. END
BEGIN NOW The cops shake off the crash and pull their guns, shouting in confused unison, “Freeze! Don't anybody ever move!!” Does he let out a maniacal cackle? They all start shooting.  END
BEGIN NOW His arms hook into the lattice, and he goes limp, hanging there twenty feet up. END
BEGIN NOW She starts screaming at the cops and swearing at them.  END
BEGIN NOW They all guiltily slink away, and the scene is cleared as the camera holds the image of a large house dimply lit by the moon, a broken headlight, maybe a hub cap or a rim, and a body hanging from the lattice.  END
BEGIN NOW And a girl a foot or two above him on the balcoy crying.  END
BEGIN NOW There's a lute at the bottom of the lattice.  END
BEGIN NOW It might be broken. END
BEGIN NOW Not quite what I was looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW Close.  END
BEGIN NOW Closer than the last one.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno how I feel about this shit.  END
BEGIN NOW It reeks of childish ...  END
BEGIN NOW  ess. END
BEGIN NOW Remember when I was “I”and you were “You”? And the only thing between us was “love”.  END
BEGIN NOW We made a simple little three word family.  END
BEGIN NOW It was beautiful.  END
BEGIN NOW There was subject, action, and object.  END
BEGIN NOW What more could we want? Just us eight letters, letting several spaces make each aspect an essential aspect of the whole.  END
BEGIN NOW That was nice. END
BEGIN NOW Something about three word sentences.  END
BEGIN NOW They seem to reach into a seperate reality and pull out the intestines of our inner workings out with it, so that we may watch our various aspects preform.  END
BEGIN NOW 'it' 'was' 'nice' '.' An unspecified subject no longer is passively palletable.  END
BEGIN NOW Who can argue with this? Who can relate to it? END
BEGIN NOW The past.  END
BEGIN NOW When I wasn't alone.  END
BEGIN NOW When I slept next to a specific softness, when I smiled for no particular reason.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW  .  END
BEGIN NOW  When was that? When was that? END
BEGIN NOW When we could feel people looking at us, feel their thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW They're thinking “Aren't those two beautiful young people? They'll have a long beautiful life together.” Didn't that ever happen? Didn't we live and die together once? Or did I simply touch her nose? So gently making contact, didn't that happen once? END
BEGIN NOW I once was “I” standing safely behind live.  END
BEGIN NOW The love chased you to the end of the sentence.  END
BEGIN NOW But who are we now? Who have we become? Like the silly picture books about the missing piece or the square peg stuck in the land of the round holes.  END
BEGIN NOW Stuck in the land of mass transit bookworms and clogged cubby holes. END
BEGIN NOW Living off memories of what once was, chewing on thoughts of you, like squeezing protien from a leather shoe.  END
BEGIN NOW Chew it continually, beef jerky fiend.  END
BEGIN NOW Foot flavored pain.  END
BEGIN NOW You are meant to fake it.  END
BEGIN NOW And don't take anything not prescribed.  END
BEGIN NOW Live on – live on – live on – live in the dreams and thoughts and sun swept spots and shadow dancings above the window.  END
BEGIN NOW Let the images and faces wander on through, past broken stained glass tear streaked cheek bones of a thousand forgotten things... END
BEGIN NOW There once was a boy who loved a girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She was crazy, like all girls.  END
BEGIN NOW He was stupid and happy, like all boys.  END
BEGIN NOW Until they meet girls.  END
BEGIN NOW Once he met her, he streaked across the sky like an ightmare, bouncing between horizon lines, and she stood beneath, watching his rainbow streaks of joy shower down on her.  END
BEGIN NOW And they laughed and danced for years and years and years.  END
BEGIN NOW They pranced and lollygagged, wallowed in each others effervescence.  END
BEGIN NOW They went to funerals and held hands, watching the bodies lowered into the deep.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn't know the dead.  END
BEGIN NOW They simply enjoyed the spectacle.  END
BEGIN NOW As if it helped them know something more.  END
BEGIN NOW And they ran off when the burying was done.  END
BEGIN NOW They took turns spitting at the sun.  END
BEGIN NOW They never made it, but just as well, because who knows what might happen had the sun been strick with their spit, infected with intimace... END
BEGIN NOW The sund oes not know these things.  END
BEGIN NOW A was of juicy goo, made from the mouths of youthful two.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun only heats.  END
BEGIN NOW Only watches and thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW And its thoughts are as follows... END
BEGIN NOW “I am very glad that I am alone.” END
BEGIN NOW The lovers would glide away from the rays of the sun, hiding until the moon came out to join them.  END
BEGIN NOW The morose ball of dead rock that hurtles and ponders on all the wonderful things it would be if someone would join her.  END
BEGIN NOW The moons thoughts are as follows... END
BEGIN NOW “Woe is me that my skin is harsh and grey.  END
BEGIN NOW That these wandering people never stop to gaze into my face.  END
BEGIN NOW They look upon me as upon a dead sun, prolonging their gaze to wonder about what made me ever burn out.  END
BEGIN NOW It was eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Eyes like think.  END
BEGIN NOW Eyes that look too deep and find something barren and graceless beneath.  END
BEGIN NOW Why would you let my fire die? Why would you choose to view the inner workings, thereby sapping the beauty, when I could be so externally beautiful? So powerfully charged and truthful? Why would you let my fire die?” END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW I guess you start every piece as one person and end it as another.  END
BEGIN NOW You are the alpha and the omega.  END
BEGIN NOW The beginning and the end.  END
BEGIN NOW Any character who believes in you will not perish but will have everlasting life on the shelf to the right of my family picture... END
BEGIN NOW I don't have a family picture.  END
BEGIN NOW I've left so as to miss them.  END
BEGIN NOW And I do.  END
BEGIN NOW Every day.  END
BEGIN NOW But I don't have a family picture.  END
BEGIN NOW Self inflicted exile. END
BEGIN NOW MADE A LADY HATE ME END
BEGIN NOW I made a friend hate me today. END
BEGIN NOW A pretty lady. END
BEGIN NOW I told her not to visit, because I can't take it. END
BEGIN NOW And she flipped. END
BEGIN NOW And All I can look at right now is the key that says ctrl. END
BEGIN NOW control. END
BEGIN NOW and alt. END
BEGIN NOW alternative. END
BEGIN NOW shift. END
BEGIN NOW enter. END
BEGIN NOW period. END
BEGIN NOW Home. END
BEGIN NOW End. END
BEGIN NOW Pause/break, delete and escape... END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry I'm not miserable over you any more. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry I can't dance in the piss mud of excess. END
BEGIN NOW In the dreary gloom of just-us. END
BEGIN NOW I fear justice.  END
BEGIN NOW I fear END
BEGIN NOW what I've done and who I've become. END
BEGIN NOW I fear what I crave END
BEGIN NOW and where I've awoken END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry. END
BEGIN NOW You were beautiful once. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you still are. END
BEGIN NOW You took me places, or maybe I was driving. END
BEGIN NOW We went there.  END
BEGIN NOW We found that.  END
BEGIN NOW We saw those things and felt it all through our electiric spines. END
BEGIN NOW And alot of people died in alot of ways. END
BEGIN NOW And alot of confusion still leaks through people into their homes and across their faces and END
BEGIN NOW It's not contempt.  END
BEGIN NOW It's fear. END
BEGIN NOW Fear of who you are and where you're going, and whether I want to watch. END
BEGIN NOW Am I allowed to walk>? END
BEGIN NOW Am I allowed to hitch hike out of your life and find something I can handle? END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I just be that long haired bastard in the sandals? END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I jjust accept your hatred and shrug it off and let it go and move on and wake up tomorrow? END
BEGIN NOW I keep waking up yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW I keep waking up into places I haven't been and don't belong. END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I talk? END
BEGIN NOW Talk to strangers. END
BEGIN NOW Beautiful happy intriguing strangers who want to tell me where they came from? END
BEGIN NOW Why can't I call ? Or write? END
BEGIN NOW Why are there so many faces that cylcle through? END
BEGIN NOW Gypsy eyes and ojos and tanktop and Ruski, and Amy doesn't have a nickname, but she's visinting Berkeley in a week. END
BEGIN NOW A girl called me weak.  END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Funny.  END
BEGIN NOW It took every ounce of effort in me to tell her not to come.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't believe I told her. END
BEGIN NOW Sweetness.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn.  END
BEGIN NOW fuck sweetness. END
BEGIN NOW Well that's done.  END
BEGIN NOW I've dropped that vase several times, but ... END
BEGIN NOW I've a weak mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Too much horsepower.  END
BEGIN NOW Not enough stability. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not so delicate these days, buti find that amazing, appealing, END
BEGIN NOW I feel like Mikey. END
BEGIN NOW For the first time in a century. END
BEGIN NOW And Mikey is tired. END
BEGIN NOW SONG END
BEGIN NOW Your eyes are not like tropical oceans reflecting a sunset.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor are they eyes of tired exploding suns.  END
BEGIN NOW They shall not be referred to as "sapphire shining" or "the well my soul flounder in." Your eyes are not the spot I crawl inside when I cry.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor are they windows into the sky.  END
BEGIN NOW Any and all references to your eyes are hereby reduced to the formal, "blue" or the semi-formal, "nice." END
BEGIN NOW strict adherence to these aforementioned items, while not being mandatory or enforced, is highly encouraged, and will be rewarded with a comfortable distance from the emotions that the we of the world remain oh so baffled by.  END
BEGIN NOW In the event that the author becomes half-assed in his strictly platonic approach, the proper authorities will be notified, and the author will be exposed to unpleasant stimuli in order to deter him from repeating any behavior that might cause his eyes to become "starry" or "Bright" or any other unrealistic adjective meant to cause shimmering and quivering.  END
BEGIN NOW There shall be no shimmering and quivering.  END
BEGIN NOW There shall be no references to limpid pools, nor the sun, oceans or sky.  END
BEGIN NOW I have very little poetry these days.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no romantic notions or optimistic shimmer.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no concept of poetics.  END
BEGIN NOW No rumbling diatribe hiding behind my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW My eyes are as dead and passive as they seem.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a hard time talking when you're around because I don't actually think about emotions any more.  END
BEGIN NOW Let me show to you the extent of my emotional capabilities:  END
BEGIN NOW "Music is pleasing.  END
BEGIN NOW Work is not.  END
BEGIN NOW Booze and pot are nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Sleep is the best." END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure what happened.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess I may have closed off. END
BEGIN NOW It's this rambling sort of wander through your day, finding specifics that really capture something.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Like how the upside down cycler seems to embody everything for a second.  END
BEGIN NOW There are little details throughout the day that do that to you.  END
BEGIN NOW But they're secret details saved special for you.  END
BEGIN NOW And if the main goal is simply moving between these magic details, than plot is totally unnecisarry.  END
BEGIN NOW Plot, in fact, gives an unrealistic illusion of movement and destination.  END
BEGIN NOW What I'm saying is you really ought to (I've started saying ought to.  END
BEGIN NOW Not oughta.  END
BEGIN NOW ought to) you really ought to start doing daily journal entries.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially now END
BEGIN NOW STIFLED RELEASE END
BEGIN NOW Some mornings I wake up and I can't poop. END
BEGIN NOW I live a tortured and godless life. END
BEGIN NOW My decisions, my string of choices, END
BEGIN NOW he recurring pattern that I slowly shape with my daily movements... END
BEGIN NOW They lack God, because they are mine. END
BEGIN NOW They are God, because they are intention. END
BEGIN NOW They lack love because I choose things according to the weather in my tiny snowglobe.  END
BEGIN NOW They are love, because it is an individual trying to align with the universe. END
BEGIN NOW I left the valley and the church so that I could be guided by my own experience, my own logic, my own universe.  END
BEGIN NOW No, not my own, rather the real universe.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that continues on with out any of us, without our ideals or our assumptions or our faiths and lacks thereof. END
BEGIN NOW I left the tiny little snowglobe of the valley and I've taken a hiatus from the church because I learned all the lines, and I rehearsed all the prayers and I knew how to respond to someone who was "Wrong".  END
BEGIN NOW I knew how to show people they were "wrong". END
BEGIN NOW And than I realized I didn't know shit.  END
BEGIN NOW And I suddenly exhaled a mighty breath and looked around, and saw all these beautiful crazy people moving in beautiful crazy ways.  END
BEGIN NOW And I decided to hate language, because it grasps deseprately at intention.  END
BEGIN NOW Tries constantly and absurdly to put a collar on this exploding chaotic universe.  END
BEGIN NOW To build glass walls of "The Way Things Are" and "Proper" bullshit. END
BEGIN NOW We have choice.  END
BEGIN NOW Very small daily choice.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't choose whether or not to put sugar in my coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW I need coffee, and I can't drink it black.  END
BEGIN NOW I need sugar.  END
BEGIN NOW BUT! I choose how much sugar, and with discipline and a network of supporters, I can slowly teach myself to wean off the sugar. END
BEGIN NOW The real problem, though, is not pooping. END
BEGIN NOW I can't afford healthy food, so I get constipated.  END
BEGIN NOW This is all a self reflexive metaphor for graduating from Cal in English still lacking the capacity to "Get off the shitter" as it were. END
BEGIN NOW sadly, there is no rehabilitation for the boring people in life.  END
BEGIN NOW Come with me, to California, where beautiful foriegn women dance in the trees and throw down canned cocktails.  END
BEGIN NOW Come with me to the center of the circle, and look around at the screaming lovelies. END
BEGIN NOW GOD made this.  END
BEGIN NOW He made me write this too. END
BEGIN NOW I think he may have been drinking at the time. END
BEGIN NOW Not me though.  END
BEGIN NOW stone cold sober as a nun. END
BEGIN NOW Well, a little stoned.  END
BEGIN NOW But I am a mere leaf being blown along by the winds of this world, pausing long enough aloft above a bonfire, letting it tickle and singe my veins. END
BEGIN NOW YOu know, maybe people are DIFFERENT!!!! END
BEGIN NOW Some are twigs and some are branches. END
BEGIN NOW Holding standing, firm pure and permenant, END
BEGIN NOW or drifting, flittering, through God's sky, and into his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW no body cares because the weather doesn't change in the snowglobe.  END
BEGIN NOW Until the lord brings down a rain of fiber and hail, and we know that we have unstopped the floodgates of hatred and pain that have been building leagues and centuries behind us, rising, rising now to consume us and all we've created.  END
BEGIN NOW All the toppling towers of humanity's masturbatory greatness, ready to crumble into the self righteous shit pile of realizing that the other half of the world is smelling and stepping in your shit.  END
BEGIN NOW And they're sick, because shit makes people sick.  END
BEGIN NOW And poor people have to live next to the shit tanks and thrive on the fumes of the ignorance of those who have never known hunger except as a social game. END
BEGIN NOW NOTE TO SELF END
BEGIN NOW The truth of the matter is at the very smallest aspect of matter, and so on, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW The glass ceiling is made of toys.  END
BEGIN NOW Items and ownerships, envy and classism.  END
BEGIN NOW As a collective society, to shrug this off like Atlas is impossible at this time.  END
BEGIN NOW America is the rare place where we just may try something that's never worked before.  END
BEGIN NOW We just may.  END
BEGIN NOW But not until we have to.  END
BEGIN NOW Establish that time line, predict that moment of shift, and stand at the opposite end of the tilting table, plate poised to catch.  END
BEGIN NOW We exist in the ruins of our failed projects, or abandoned dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW A shroud of satelites surrounds our heads.  END
BEGIN NOW The broken dreams and failed attempts of our ancestors weighs down on us.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes us forget. END
BEGIN NOW WHIM IN THE NIGHT END
BEGIN NOW all your ideas come in the night END
BEGIN NOW all your thoughts come with darkness. END
BEGIN NOW In funny shaped foriegn automobiles with plates that don't make sense. END
BEGIN NOW Either nine characters long or four characyters shourt. END
BEGIN NOW And when you close your eyes the shapes don't come, and your body is relaxerd, but the buzzing won't stop. END
BEGIN NOW One thought comes: A man who wakes every morning, and runs outside joyous as all hell. END
BEGIN NOW "It's happening again!! It's happening again!! " END
BEGIN NOW Shut up Johnny. END
BEGIN NOW But it's rising!! THe sun is back! It went all the way round and returned! END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, Johnny.  END
BEGIN NOW i know.  END
BEGIN NOW (I would feel much smarter than him, but he's much happier, and if being smart means you aint happy, it aint all that smart) END
BEGIN NOW Look at it man! Just look at it! END
BEGIN NOW It's beautiful Johnny. END
BEGIN NOW And I'll roll another cigarette END
BEGIN NOW just 'cause the sun aint up yet. END
BEGIN NOW Don't worry, sun.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm keepin an eyeon everything. END
BEGIN NOW and its good to know that cigarettees still glow, even as late as four in the morn. END
BEGIN NOW It comforts me.  END
BEGIN NOW The smoke. END
BEGIN NOW At lesast it's still awake, idling drifting and swirling through the empty room. END
BEGIN NOW I laid on my back and made my whole body relax, one piece at a time. END
BEGIN NOW I laid on my side, but couldn't turn of my mind. END
BEGIN NOW I sat up and started typing, END
BEGIN NOW I thought about how perfect this is. END
BEGIN NOW Not perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW But exactly precise and ...  END
BEGIN NOW perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Five in the morn.  END
BEGIN NOW Other people's easter.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone elses monday.  END
BEGIN NOW Somebodys morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now. END
BEGIN NOW And if I for one second think I've got it bad or rough or wrong, than fuck me. END
BEGIN NOW Fuck me and every overpriveliged ... END
BEGIN NOW fuck me. END
BEGIN NOW THere's clicking in the bathroom and whirring in the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW several guitars spotted around the room, shillouetted by the light from the laptop screen. END
BEGIN NOW And my fingernails can always be shorter.  END
BEGIN NOW My nights can always lasty longer. END
BEGIN NOW My cigarettes thicker, my drinks stronger. END
BEGIN NOW My convictions more sensible END
BEGIN NOW my goals more true END
BEGIN NOW my thought s more cohesive my words more fitting my face more polished and shaved. END
BEGIN NOW My teeth brushed, my hair cut my clothes cleaned my my my END
BEGIN NOW nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothin. END
BEGIN NOW I love my jalopy, but love means abuse. END
BEGIN NOW Abuse means proper use, and you don't seem to understand what I mean. END
BEGIN NOW my body does what I will it to.  END
BEGIN NOW There are things more important.  END
BEGIN NOW More pressing.  END
BEGIN NOW More intriguing.  END
BEGIN NOW Less depressing. END
BEGIN NOW ACCIDENTAL GRADUATE END
BEGIN NOW I graduated accidentally, because my rambling just happened to coincide with what the major required of me.  END
BEGIN NOW What my degree got me was the ability to aim my ramble towards what my audience might be hoping to hear.  END
BEGIN NOW This is how I accidentally became a cook, a local news reporter for a town I had never been to, and now property manager for a half house half squat.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all just a rambling bluff, half hoping my words might click a switch somewhere and unlock the large stone door. END
BEGIN NOW So my degree has taught me to dismantle all aspects of reality until society is nothing more than a game of interdependent grinning, and my voice is nothing more than the sum total pendulum swing back from my father's view towards my grandfather's, but on a different plane, towards a twelve piece cycle circling around and dripping down your spine.  END
BEGIN NOW God, what am I talking about? What my English degree has got me.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, the ability to sound deep.  END
BEGIN NOW The pomposity to write as if I'm talking to you, the whim of ambient ramblistic tappings into subconscious apophenic patterns, but really it's all just flashing lights.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel like my writing was retrospective childhood memoir in junior college, psychadelic rule breaking chaotic word game dance face trembles through Cal, and now it's become a mixture of psychadelic retrospect and rambley business plans.  END
BEGIN NOW As of late my creative goals have become oriented around triggering the act of creation in others.  END
BEGIN NOW Since the central goal is to prompt the act of expression, the central technique should be very detached from intellectualization and closer to the immediate and measurable experience of reality.  END
BEGIN NOW If this is the central goal and purpose than simply the act ought to suffice, self justify, and such and so on.  END
BEGIN NOW In this vein I've forced myself to become detatched from the concept of a complete and cohesive project, dedicating my efforts to getting lost in the detail. END
BEGIN NOW But sludging through this stream of quagulated phlegm, pushing against a stream of lights launching out of the screen, pushing eyes deeper in, pulling attention further out, further further away from the self aware origins of mind and self.  END
BEGIN NOW COMING OF AGE NOVELLA END
BEGIN NOW I feel like I'm not alive yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Like if I get this book thing done with, get this fucking piece of shit out of the way, I'll be on my way.  END
BEGIN NOW You're writing a book? What's it about? I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you, don't read it.  END
BEGIN NOW It's just a book.  END
BEGIN NOW Seven years is stupid, especially when I don't even know what the fuck I'm writing about.  END
BEGIN NOW I can just see the genre marker now, "Coming of Age Novellas" Fuck You!! I guess I shouldn't resist it though.  END
BEGIN NOW I just came of age.  END
BEGIN NOW Why the fuck not? And in America no less.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to make it up as I went along.  END
BEGIN NOW So the book is done now.  END
BEGIN NOW At least I assume it is, otherwise this intro is a bit premature.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose the whole endeavor was premature, trying to write before any sort of reason to write was there.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess I still don't have a reason to write.  END
BEGIN NOW The only reason I'm writing right now is to justify or explain all that messy writing that went on before this.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I'm just laying my trail. END
BEGIN NOW We used to blaze trails in the woods by our childhood house.  END
BEGIN NOW Me and my brothers would take machetes and shovels and hatchets and find a shortcut that hadn't been found yet, up some preposterous slope, turning up poison oak for us to itch at, and tunneling into some scotch broom to hack at.  END
BEGIN NOW The trail would always lead up to a massive tree stump shaped vaguely like a castle.  END
BEGIN NOW On some occasions we built the castle out, forming decks with fallen logs and camouflage with fallen branches.  END
BEGIN NOW That has nothing to do with anything, but the thought of it seemed so relevant and vivid, it had to be mentioned.  END
BEGIN NOW LESS AND LESS END
BEGIN NOW I feel very little. END
BEGIN NOW I feel less and less. END
BEGIN NOW Life laughs as it passes and I can't help but feel I'm being tested. END
BEGIN NOW The universe warps and flexes and giggles when I break. END
BEGIN NOW Is it diet? Am I trying too hard? Am I a series of horrible mistakes? END
BEGIN NOW he water is cloudy, there's shit in the sink.  END
BEGIN NOW My stomach is howling about corn dogs and energy drinks. END
BEGIN NOW I slump deeper, my slouching seems to scream.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm tired.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm broken.  END
BEGIN NOW I've forgotten how to sing.  END
BEGIN NOW It's nothing specific.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a vague overwhelming sickness.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't hate or cry or cut myself.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven't quit or given up, in fact I feel I'm doing quite well.  END
BEGIN NOW By my cheek skin sags and my eyes they droop.  END
BEGIN NOW There are clouds in the water, and there's shit in the sink. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I roll off the chair and onto the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW My drink spills out at the threshold, by the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Can I sleep it off? Is that close enough to death?  END
BEGIN NOW I'm done with this goddamn in between chapter.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to know what's next. END
BEGIN NOW slumped and blasted.  END
BEGIN NOW Pound another energy drink so I can crash again.  END
BEGIN NOW So I'll be sure these aren't my thoughts and I can just shrug them off.  END
BEGIN NOW curled up and crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW I keep moving and slipping because I'm so fucking lazy.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as I'm tired, something must have been done.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as I can't identify it as mine, this shit storm.  END
BEGIN NOW This goddamn stupid fucking shit storm brain.  END
BEGIN NOW DIE BRAIN DIE! I'll fill you with chemicals that keep you running laps.  END
BEGIN NOW my conscious mind laughs as the rest of me falls into turmoil, exhausted and lost.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm still me and I've defeated myself.  END
BEGIN NOW I win.  END
BEGIN NOW I am subdued.  END
BEGIN NOW Monastics fast so as to discipline the body.  END
BEGIN NOW To develop control.  END
BEGIN NOW So they can go into the world and give and give except those stupid fuckers never leave.  END
BEGIN NOW Their ideal of bringing truth and joy to the world has been flipped around, and now they've locked themselves in.  END
BEGIN NOW They starve themselves as masochistic punishment for taking part in the joys of the flesh.  END
BEGIN NOW The joys of the flesh.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck this vein.  END
BEGIN NOW This nasty depressing condemnation of saints.  END
BEGIN NOW This excuse to masturbate and claim it's God's glorious hand powered joy-machine.  END
BEGIN NOW This excuse to judge and accuse and demonize.  END
BEGIN NOW Smirking, I look at the screen.  END
BEGIN NOW I imagine it a mirror, these words are my face.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks tired.  END
BEGIN NOW One eye is wide, the other droopy and dry.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks like I've been trying.  END
BEGIN NOW But really, I don't fucking know . END
BEGIN NOW I resent and condemn all that holds me back from my ramble.  END
BEGIN NOW I tout my glorious shit filled mouth and parade about like a dog chewing on a dead mouse.  END
BEGIN NOW As things bounce back and the flow changes, as it subsides, my energy dies, my words trickle off, and I'm still eternally pissed that I need this release.  END
BEGIN NOW This diuretic issuance of noise.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it pleasant? Fuck if I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm just trying to clear the dusty cloud water shit pile brain spill that stains my teeth with yellow memories and greenish brown predictions.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon, water will fall from the clouds, and wash this shit down the ocean sink. END
BEGIN NOW THE MED END
BEGIN NOW We identify ourselves in relation to our surroundings.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm on a bench twelve feet from a redwood tree on the corner of Dwight and Hillside.  END
BEGIN NOW A passerby just honked their nose.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside from there there's birds and wind in the trees, recurring bicycle bells, seemingly meaningless ringing, as if the bikers are ringing for the steepness of the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW But we love the steepness.  END
BEGIN NOW Life suddenly violently all at once.  END
BEGIN NOW We sat on this bench three years ago reading poetry and drinking steel reserve after closing the Med kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW We sad on this bench two years ago reading "When Now, the Med Eulogy."  END
BEGIN NOW We sat on this bench last year and rehashed plans for Med the Musical.  END
BEGIN NOW Now i'm here alone pretending to be waiting, pretending to be busy, busy with tapping back into various ways I am and have been here.  END
BEGIN NOW When/Now is the crucial closing remarks written a month before I quit the Med, and thank God that glorious story will never be told.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps.  END
BEGIN NOW But first the closing notes that preclude my absurd exodus. END
BEGIN NOW RAGGEDY REMINISCENCE END
BEGIN NOW Straight to the fist clenching imagery.  END
BEGIN NOW Past the hesitant abstractions into what actually is.  END
BEGIN NOW Straight to the fist clenching imagery.  END
BEGIN NOW The history.  END
BEGIN NOW The plans for glorious faulty repetitions.  END
BEGIN NOW Insistent desperate repititions.  END
BEGIN NOW Incessant despairing repitititions. END
BEGIN NOW The unstoppable rolling END
BEGIN NOW out of new ways to prove that END
BEGIN NOW we are what we've always been. END
BEGIN NOW small partial grove of redwoods in a park, END
BEGIN NOW Not much doin.  END
BEGIN NOW Not much to do.  END
BEGIN NOW But we are busy with the same old mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Raggedy grunge reminiscent of what once was. END
BEGIN NOW What once was powerful, tasteful, and true.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure it's still here, somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW In the heart of the bubble END
BEGIN NOW he mind of the pimple END
BEGIN NOW he face of every child who laughs, and than cries as Spider the drunk laughs by.. END
BEGIN NOW ying his flag to the iron fence, a hungry unkempt teenager, decorates, displaying his symbolic linens. END
BEGIN NOW some reminiscent memory of flowers in gun barrels.  END
BEGIN NOW not what you thought it was.  END
BEGIN NOW Gumbo.  END
BEGIN NOW Murky stew of human essence, END
BEGIN NOW steeped in lackadaisical loiter lot grow onward upward into abstract absurdities. END
BEGIN NOW waiting for someone to remind us why we ought to care. END
BEGIN NOW we've always been here, in the park, under the trees.  END
BEGIN NOW How soon will it not be enough to simply make due? END
BEGIN NOW Something happened loud and long ago, long and loud ago.  END
BEGIN NOW We came here to hear echoes.  END
BEGIN NOW To see if the scraps might hold some sign.  END
BEGIN NOW THe branches will always break off in the wind and shed leafy tears multiple times a year, END
BEGIN NOW he twiggy stick fingers will never know home except to fall and be ground into edible soil again, END
BEGIN NOW reconsumed by Godless trunk.  END
BEGIN NOW To leave, to pursue the sky, this is the work of branches.  END
BEGIN NOW The work of children and heady drifty seeker dancers.  END
BEGIN NOW Does the wind ever catch properly?  END
BEGIN NOW Are we ever propelled into weightless transcendence, or merely head change transience?  END
BEGIN NOW Some passer bys point up, past the spreading arms of the tree, and say "See that drifter? Not a care in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW No family, no home.  END
BEGIN NOW No feet on the ground." some passer bys get the point, and smile.  END
BEGIN NOW the wind is doing its job as is the leaf and the sky and the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people see.  END
BEGIN NOW Pursuit of silence and noise.  END
BEGIN NOW Of patterns and chaos.  END
BEGIN NOW Of mine self and of losing that cursed reference point.  END
BEGIN NOW Of losing the point.  END
BEGIN NOW Glory in the lack of grimacing factoids that parade in front of me like mice into the oven.  END
BEGIN NOW To cook and burn and be forgotten once again, END
BEGIN NOW he last molecule propelled upward, into the sky, END
BEGIN NOW past stretching branch arms, END
BEGIN NOW past dancing wind leaves, END
BEGIN NOW and truly once more into nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW To burn.  END
BEGIN NOW To be forgotten.  END
BEGIN NOW To be and to not to be.  END
BEGIN NOW This tortured social logic.  END
BEGIN NOW To bend the box to fuck the box to laugh at the walls and stick your arm through, END
BEGIN NOW for there is nothing there.  END
BEGIN NOW This is what we pursue.  END
BEGIN NOW In this cave of ours.  END
BEGIN NOW In this cave.  END
BEGIN NOW The truth of the lack thereof.  END
BEGIN NOW The knowledge of absence.  END
BEGIN NOW holding in your hand a partial thought of something that once was.  END
BEGIN NOW A tree perhaps.  END
BEGIN NOW shurunken realms.  END
BEGIN NOW Incomplete knowledge base.  END
BEGIN NOW Faulty logic in flawed assumptions.  END
BEGIN NOW Patterns.  END
BEGIN NOW broken breaking exploding patterns.  END
BEGIN NOW Shatter patterns through geneologies across crowds.  END
BEGIN NOW Into hearts and onto maps, expanding like raind drop fractals, rippling outward.  END
BEGIN NOW The disinformation spreads. END
BEGIN NOW boundless experiments and tumultuous phrasings, END
BEGIN NOW our paradigms of language folding in backwards and mirroring something that was already upside down... END
BEGIN NOW Our words are spiraling out of control now, no longer relaying meaning, END
BEGIN NOW except as abstract replications of brains that can hardly cope with sentence phrase thought stalling stop before the wall before the alter before your children learn what kind of a monster you are. END
BEGIN NOW ECHOES END
BEGIN NOW Something happened loud and long ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Its echo reverberates to this day, which is why I say fuck this place.  END
BEGIN NOW Saturated in conflicting layers, this place remains in chaotic stagnation.  END
BEGIN NOW The vacationers are harassed by the locals who don't like how the old people run this pace.  END
BEGIN NOW The students, the transients, experience this place as a stop off, a rest on the way to greater things.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I really do want to leave this place, where all my thoughts and efforts are caught up in everyone else's unplannable pattern repitition. END
BEGIN NOW Experiencing a plot seems more central than relaying the various occurences that brought it about.Not stopping to explain why subject matter changed, just hanging in space waiting in faith for the wheel to come round again.  END
BEGIN NOW Camped on the edge of a concept I stutter out half thoughts and struggle against the onslaught of distractions, but it's too late. END
BEGIN NOW Pheromone saturated sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't gawk.  END
BEGIN NOW Along she comes, pausing to check if I'm watching. END
BEGIN NOW Wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW She's checking for cars.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop looking. END
BEGIN NOW I fall through visions emenating from her cheek, END
BEGIN NOW left meek and bashful by the shape of her eye. END
BEGIN NOW Try to grin.  END
BEGIN NOW Did it send the message?  END
BEGIN NOW She's checking for cars again. END
BEGIN NOW She's got that skirt fuck bra strap look, END
BEGIN NOW She leaves me screaming obscenities. END
BEGIN NOW The conflicting friction of the call to be socially competent and present while being sucked aside by these subtle hints of decadence.  END
BEGIN NOW The headspace it takes to maintain this strange form of social grace is the manifestation of intensely bad taste, and yet I will not look away. END
BEGIN NOW THE FUTILITY OF SELF EXPRESSING SELF END
BEGIN NOW For the first time in my life today, I sat down on the curb outside of Moe's books and looked at Caffe Med.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks like corrugated tin and washed out circus colors.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks like foggy shoddy murk town slurp in and keep it down.  END
BEGIN NOW Something triumphant and homey, a return.  END
BEGIN NOW It's been waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW for years perhaps, standing in unison with two distinct spirits.  END
BEGIN NOW The ancient original tradition home stance embodied in the geriatric regulars, and the dazed movin through outside crowd loungin lazy, always leavin and being replaced, just spangin my way on out crowd... END
BEGIN NOW I've always been overwhelmed by crowds and strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW What they might expect of me, what the proper social dance move is for the situation, whether I'm supposed to look happy or interested or non chalant.  END
BEGIN NOW This sort of apprehension is magnified when cooking for strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW Do vegans want oil or butter? Why? If not, How not, and When? What's the proper substitute for egg yolk when making a vegetarian ...  END
BEGIN NOW Make it Martin style, but Martin before the war.  END
BEGIN NOW After the war his culinary taste went to shit. END
BEGIN NOW But at the Med, I don't really have the social anxiety that my upper class privileges have allowed me to develop.  END
BEGIN NOW Rather I feel myself sink into the scenery.  END
BEGIN NOW I become a rock or a clump of moss, or one of Julia Vanguard's poems. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps the best way to approach the Med is by treating it as if it were a human, and you were exporing it's organs.  END
BEGIN NOW I might consider the grill to be the spleen.  END
BEGIN NOW the bread fridge the apendix, the bar would be the neckline, and the and the piles of trash out back would be all that junk in the trunk.  END
BEGIN NOW This task of giving the Med human characteristics is beyond my capacity.  END
BEGIN NOW I am plain and simply to lazy and selfish to talk about something besides me for that long.  END
BEGIN NOW So instead, I will develop a plan, so that in 10 years, if I come back to this and read it, I'll know what I was trying to do, instead of having some highly complicated in depth meaningful paragraph.  END
BEGIN NOW so anyways, Perhaps we shall call Chapter One; The Med's Face.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, we start on the curb in front of Moe's books lookin at the Med.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, with the corrugated tin and the washed out circus colors.  END
BEGIN NOW And the girls jump roping, in the picture by the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW This will be the first aspect of the Med having a face.  END
BEGIN NOW By showing the picture by the stairs in parallel with the initial exterior shot, we will be showing its age character and charm.  END
BEGIN NOW The Caffe Med as a little girl, surrounded by little girls jump roping.  END
BEGIN NOW I can almost hear the Med talking.  END
BEGIN NOW but not quite.  END
BEGIN NOW 'cause that's just too fuckin goofy.  END
BEGIN NOW I hear the Med purr.  END
BEGIN NOW When I go there and ignore everybody, like most days.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don't ignore everybody, but...  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again, I feel like the scenery.  END
BEGIN NOW Does the bannister care whether or not you hold it as you go up and down the stairs? Does the piano care if its face is locked so that no customers can play with it? Not really.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a sort of passive acceptance of anything and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW No, not what I meant.  END
BEGIN NOW It's like, uh, unabashed willingness to do everything or nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW everything and/or nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that's what I'll call my book. END
BEGIN NOW The third face would of course be the literal face of whoever is working behind the front counter.  END
BEGIN NOW This presents the opportunity of juxtaposing Rojelio, the stern moustacheod barrista with Rusty, who shows signs of having studied under Saint Bob Ross.  END
BEGIN NOW This juxtaposition of the two barristas will give us the chance to truly see the realism and beauty at work behind Caffe Med.  END
BEGIN NOW No, that's it.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm done.  END
BEGIN NOW Lost it.  END
BEGIN NOW What was it? Something to do with how people are who they are because they can't help END
BEGIN NOW it, and...  END
BEGIN NOW or maybe it was, you are nothing more than the decisions you make? END
BEGIN NOW No... END
BEGIN NOW No, it was how when you walk in to the room ,and there's a dozen conversations, and you ignore all of them ,and it becomes a sort of purring in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW And the room begins to almost breathe together. END
BEGIN NOW Curl up with a crowd END
BEGIN NOW On the black and white cracked tile floor. END
BEGIN NOW Feel the room shift its breathing. END
BEGIN NOW You enter the room. END
BEGIN NOW And you pause.  END
BEGIN NOW Than join in and step on END
BEGIN NOW To the black and white cracked tile floor. END
BEGIN NOW But, I'm short, And it's gone.  END
BEGIN NOW I was Just there right ow. END
BEGIN NOW Up the Street, Down and out, END
BEGIN NOW It's all Fuck! Can't be found! END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm Done. END
BEGIN NOW I slide in END
BEGIN NOW To hide END
BEGIN NOW Under this wonderous electric hum.  END
BEGIN NOW And I breath with the room END
BEGIN NOW And look down END
BEGIN NOW At the black and white cracked tile floor. END
BEGIN NOW SPIDER PIE  END
BEGIN NOW He paused next to a clean looking Porsche Carrera.  END
BEGIN NOW From my angle it looked as if he were talking to the car... END
BEGIN NOW "Well aren't you a shiny fuckin grey piece of shit! I'll bet you open your shit up and fuckin scream up and down that goddamn fuckin piece a shit freeway! Goddammit Break your fuckin teeth your mom was a whore!" END
BEGIN NOW The register he speaks in is a bit of a collection of everything offensive.  END
BEGIN NOW Lend him your ear, friendly roman, and hear how he has been in a fight with practically anyone in this town who can throw a punch. END
BEGIN NOW "I went to a party..." END
BEGIN NOW "Why the fuck were you at a party?" END
BEGIN NOW "I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW I jes' wen' in." END
BEGIN NOW "And they beat you merciless?" END
BEGIN NOW "Woke up in a puddle of my own blood." END
BEGIN NOW "So why the hell did you go?" END
BEGIN NOW "I didn't want nothin.  END
BEGIN NOW Not their women, not their booze..." END
BEGIN NOW "Eh? Eh??" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, their booze.  END
BEGIN NOW So what?" END
BEGIN NOW And those 2 words hit the table like snake eyes, ending the game.  END
BEGIN NOW So the Fuck What? END
BEGIN NOW The timeless battle cry END
BEGIN NOW Of the lost and left behind. END
BEGIN NOW So is he goin to hell? Is he in hell? Or is he lovin every minute of it? When he peeled his face off the sidewalk, oozing blood from his mouth, we all know his first word was "Fuck!" END
BEGIN NOW A very specific "Fuck" with volumes of meaning behind it.  END
BEGIN NOW In that one blood puddle moment, with that one simple word... END
BEGIN NOW What follows is an in depth look at what he meant to say when he said "Fuck." This is what he meant to say... END
BEGIN NOW "And once again I have allowed myself to encourage my dark patterns of abuse.  END
BEGIN NOW These college party boys have taken on the authoritative role of bashing, laughing and leaving.  END
BEGIN NOW The only pattern I've ever known.  END
BEGIN NOW Given to me by...  END
BEGIN NOW you'll never know.  END
BEGIN NOW I wear these patterns like a medal.  END
BEGIN NOW The flinch that craves the fist. END
BEGIN NOW I pull my broken face END
BEGIN NOW Up from the sidewalk, and see my red red essence leaking. END
BEGIN NOW I feel myself shrink. END
BEGIN NOW And than rage.  END
BEGIN NOW I pulsate. END
BEGIN NOW And I shuffle off, cradling my raggedy shitlocks, hating life.  END
BEGIN NOW Hating the history that led up to me becoming this thing. END
BEGIN NOW And so I rage.  END
BEGIN NOW Rage against my life, the endless fight.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel accomplished waking up here END
BEGIN NOW In the aftermath of getting smashed on. END
BEGIN NOW My injuries prove that I got to them.  END
BEGIN NOW I startled and shook their tidy little closed off world. END
BEGIN NOW MAKE A LETCHER END
BEGIN NOW Incapable of finding a truly personal story, we find roles to fill, old games to play. END
BEGIN NOW And even this game that I'm at now has been thrown about inside me for seven years now. END
BEGIN NOW So this now is only what was than, and now will be found within what I write next. END
BEGIN NOW But soon I'm distracted as such a fine specimen of the sensual gender passes by, END
BEGIN NOW And I'm caught in the thought of what should I say. END
BEGIN NOW I'm terrified of beautiful women, so talking to you is like skydiving.  END
BEGIN NOW Or some such thing. END
BEGIN NOW But sitting here is simply the soft and passing essence of possibility. END
BEGIN NOW "Such a poetic lecher" they'll say of me. END
BEGIN NOW "He'd oogle the asses while erecting his poetry." END
BEGIN NOW This campus is sure to make a lecher of me. END
BEGIN NOW Maleable clay faced children wait to be molded and shaped END
BEGIN NOW Into permanance by the hand of the passing fancy of fate. END
BEGIN NOW And where does that leave me? END
BEGIN NOW To fuck someone without loving them is a very easy matter, but to love someone without fucking them is a very different matter. END
BEGIN NOW As children we branded ourselve, placing symbols deeplybeneath the skin, penetrting each others flesh signifying oneness.  END
BEGIN NOW The experience of beauty can be felt on a variety of spectrums, and to isolate your concept of beauty to the sexual spectrum is to feed all your experiences and interactions through the fuck meter, which is to eternally fuck yourself. END
BEGIN NOW The burning of symbols into the skin was a climax and a permenaization.  END
BEGIN NOW In our age we hesitate.  END
BEGIN NOW The permenance and perfection of self and realm are far too delicate and volatile to let all that which is not self there ore not perfect. END
BEGIN NOW Somehow this topic took its own course.  END
BEGIN NOW The origin was just now in the liquor store.  END
BEGIN NOW A girl in her twenties in line in front of me.  END
BEGIN NOW Her packpack says animal, she is dressed like lazy california.  END
BEGIN NOW The beach boys croon on about wouldn't it be nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Several reactions occur at once. END
BEGIN NOW That song first made sense when I was six.  END
BEGIN NOW The five year old girl in the room was who my thoughts were singing to.  END
BEGIN NOW The thought of waking up next to her in a house on the beach was nice.  END
BEGIN NOW The song is rooted in me prior to sex entering my lirfe.  END
BEGIN NOW This brought me to the sexless beauty conundrum.  END
BEGIN NOW To appreciate a womans beauty on a nonsexual level seems obvious, but ...  END
BEGIN NOW just saying it sounds fuckn absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW Do any of us remember life before sex? The joy of beauty without vague burning hopeful lust? END
BEGIN NOW TO fuck someone withouot loving them is a very easy thing.  END
BEGIN NOW But to love someone without fucking them? END
BEGIN NOW The city is separated into age groups, according to intended and not actual age.  END
BEGIN NOW The permanently pubescent inhabit Telegraph, flashing hints of their sexual capacities as they pass. END
BEGIN NOW Along Shattuck live those striving to seem adult, not with fake IDs, but with feigned decency. END
BEGIN NOW And the old are everywhere, so well known that they are forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW It's hard to do your own thing when your own thing is based on whatever is happening around you.  END
BEGIN NOW I've got to find my own thing by avoiding everyone else's thing, and ignoring every trace of anything having ever occurred, and watching whatever is left unfold. END
BEGIN NOW A sip on the old dollar store energy beverage, END
BEGIN NOW Glancing up at the sea of gorgeous women streaming past.  END
BEGIN NOW This campus will make a lecher of me.  END
BEGIN NOW But before that, before the fuck meter took over, I fed on the old had exhuberance of youth.  END
BEGIN NOW the optimistic naivate, waiting for experience to prove them otherwise.  END
BEGIN NOW We measure and gauge the relative age by how grim the features, how set the expression.  END
BEGIN NOW How weathered the features.  END
BEGIN NOW How deep and retreated the essence.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't stare too long little one.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll see the creature come undone.  END
BEGIN NOW There's an art to collapse, and these erratic breakdown bastards know. END
BEGIN NOW And they will show you how perfectly formed is their flaw. END
BEGIN NOW Perfected, chaotic, stagnation. END
BEGIN NOW ROCKADAMUS FOREVER END
BEGIN NOW We all laughed.  END
BEGIN NOW Made up names for him.  END
BEGIN NOW Pointed out our own special Pareidolia, and picked out our own special pebbles.  END
BEGIN NOW The owner pointed him out to all his friends.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone had some vague edge of what the rock was and why it was special and how deep Rockadamus really was.  END
BEGIN NOW His eye was sharp, and his poise was one willing to be watched.  END
BEGIN NOW "A good one." we all agreed.  END
BEGIN NOW A wingnut, perhaps.  END
BEGIN NOW The common follow up was "perhaps he really has it." and we all secretly knew that he kinda did.  END
BEGIN NOW kinda.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's just about as much if not more than any of us can say, so..  END
BEGIN NOW there ya go.  END
BEGIN NOW 	I watched everyone crowd around him like he was especially special, and ironically he was.  END
BEGIN NOW He proved it to them too, when he took them all to court for liable.  END
BEGIN NOW Talkin all sorts of hoodoo shit about him, he sued their asses and good.  END
BEGIN NOW At one point they had the rock take the stand, and the owner and all his friends couldn't stop laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW And the judge banged the gavel and Rockadamus won.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Afterwards, at the press conference, Rockadamus handed out pamphlets on "How To Surrender To The Rock", and "Living Tween The Rock and A Hard Place", and "Rock, The Pamphlet".  END
BEGIN NOW 	The media ate him up.  END
BEGIN NOW His sharp eye, poised, waiting for watchers.  END
BEGIN NOW For listeners.  END
BEGIN NOW For readers... END
BEGIN NOW 	He tells a good story.  END
BEGIN NOW Last I heard he had his own church in Vegas.  END
BEGIN NOW Get married with your hand on that magical piece of earth.  END
BEGIN NOW Rockadamus Forever END
BEGIN NOW EXPRESSION AGAINST THE SCREEN END
BEGIN NOW Since the central goal is to prompt the act of expression, the central technique should be very detached from intellectualization and closer to the immediate and measurable experience of reality.  END
BEGIN NOW If this is the central goal and purpose than simply the act ought to suffice, self justify, and such and so on.  END
BEGIN NOW But sludging through this stream of quagulated phlegm, pushing against a stream of lights launching out of the screen, pushing eyes deeper in, pulling attention further out, further further away from the eself aware origins of mind and self.  END
BEGIN NOW IT ENDED ON A WEDNESDAY END
BEGIN NOW I'm sad 'cause it stopped END
BEGIN NOW on a Wednesday. END
BEGIN NOW And Wednesdays are always END
BEGIN NOW "Whatever, oh well." END
BEGIN NOW No Poetry, you see, END
BEGIN NOW On Wednesdays. END
BEGIN NOW That's what gets me. END
BEGIN NOW It's not as deep and heavy. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't knock me down. END
BEGIN NOW Diluted    Muted END
BEGIN NOW Inexpressive.  END
BEGIN NOW Light and airy. END
BEGIN NOW Cotton Kandy. END
BEGIN NOW our playful games END
BEGIN NOW are wasteful shames END
BEGIN NOW and my rhymes END
BEGIN NOW are stupid and childish END
BEGIN NOW just like you. END
BEGIN NOW So many options END
BEGIN NOW Cliffs off which to step. END
BEGIN NOW Ways in which to slip END
BEGIN NOW stop the progress END
BEGIN NOW dip back into that ol' END
BEGIN NOW reservoir of oh my fuckin god. END
BEGIN NOW And on and on and la de da. END
BEGIN NOW for a moment I toy with the thought of letting her be gone.  END
BEGIN NOW And smiling back at all those pretty ladies.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah, smiling back.  END
BEGIN NOW What would that change? My bed traffic.  END
BEGIN NOW My brain.  END
BEGIN NOW her.  END
BEGIN NOW She wouldn't smile at me the same.  END
BEGIN NOW 'course she'd smile, eventually.  END
BEGIN NOW But not the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Not deeply and eternally.  END
BEGIN NOW I broke that again.  END
BEGIN NOW Now when she smiles at me, it hides the cynical knowledge of my drunks.  END
BEGIN NOW I love her.  END
BEGIN NOW and that matters, goddamit. END
BEGIN NOW why is now the only time I experience? Why is my sadness about her leaving more important than her existence? If she were to disappear never return and so on my sadness would linger on.  END
BEGIN NOW She is merely a trigger for these emotions.  END
BEGIN NOW Something to send the bleak landscape crashing down on you... END
BEGIN NOW But something beyond logic.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the card man said.  END
BEGIN NOW Put the landscape back, next to your ex's head.  END
BEGIN NOW and remember.  END
BEGIN NOW It does matter. END
BEGIN NOW It does fucking matter. END
BEGIN NOW People care. END
BEGIN NOW More importantly, you fucking care.  END
BEGIN NOW And you're tired, but you kinda like that... END
BEGIN NOW but we're gonna cut it off here.  END
BEGIN NOW Time for bed. END
BEGIN NOW FIRST APPEAL END
BEGIN NOW "What makes one piece pointed and purposeful and another pointless and petty?" He paused, at the peak of his pace path, twirling lightly on his loafers, he commenced his pacing.  END
BEGIN NOW A scab on my face comes loose, the juice of yesterday's existence hardened into papyrus.  END
BEGIN NOW on my way here I saw a woman crouching on the sidewalk observing a bug.  END
BEGIN NOW I observed her and pondered what she saw in the bug.  END
BEGIN NOW What made it worthwhile.  END
BEGIN NOW A furrow in my mental skin shifted and i made a note to make a note. END
BEGIN NOW Left with shreds again.  END
BEGIN NOW The torn pocket threatens to let the wallet slip through my shredded jeans and with it my fading identity.  END
BEGIN NOW What makes one piece worthwhile and another not?" END
BEGIN NOW Talking about myself to myself seems to be self defeating.  END
BEGIN NOW Listing woes written in vague metaphor won't cease the flow or reinvigorate the mojo.  END
BEGIN NOW The matter at hand is experience.  END
BEGIN NOW The crisis is this heavy blanket of inner self, ironically clouding the outside world from view.  END
BEGIN NOW How much I've missed.  END
BEGIN NOW How many chances avoided, ignored.  END
BEGIN NOW At someone Else's behest. END
BEGIN NOW Now rooted so deep, so distant, lost amidst the eternal list of internal things in me.  END
BEGIN NOW Calm, shut.  END
BEGIN NOW Down, up.  END
BEGIN NOW Still though, something is there. END
BEGIN NOW Back and forth bellowing about each one, so many excuses, complaints to turn up. END
BEGIN NOW So many walls fortified by my faith that I know and I've been and I'm done and you're wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a long list of bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW  That which holds me back. END
BEGIN NOW lack of ego lack of faith lack of enterprise and care END
BEGIN NOW and the self righteous glare of self imposed pain and alienation.  END
BEGIN NOW I stopped talking when i found no one understood the words I stumbled over, attempting to tell a three part joke that references breakfast this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW You make me feel stupid because I'm smarter than you. END
BEGIN NOW So I guess that puts us on the same page. END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe you make me feel stupid because I'm stupid. END
BEGIN NOW And interpersonal pontification is the point I've been avoiding, poking around in brain drawers filling the skull room with smoke and cravings. END
BEGIN NOW What happened to the great tradition of crude cave drawings? END
BEGIN NOW You see, that was at the dawn of expression, and complexity shows sophistication.  END
BEGIN NOW Simple conversation and straightforward approachable pieces are shameful in the eyes of our highly specialized society.  END
BEGIN NOW Less and less a day do we spend outside ourselves, preoccupied occupying our hollow bodies.  END
BEGIN NOW Flecks of skin drift off and are eaten by bugs on the sidewalk. END
BEGIN NOW A simple transfer of energy.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing really. END
BEGIN NOW SECOND APPEAL END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps this anxiety is nothing more than guilt for not producing, for not doing. END
BEGIN NOW But music is existence, and expression is just a way to measure time, so simply being present is in truth producing something. END
BEGIN NOW This anxiety acts as a screen, a grid of self analysis, holding me back from release. END
BEGIN NOW So if this anxiety is what holds me back from producing, tan it truly is the most relevant topic. END
BEGIN NOW And back we fall once more in to the mind chasm, but aware now of its infinite hollow depth and draining complexity.  END
BEGIN NOW And so we step back once more and ghasp, suddenly unwilling to look in. END
BEGIN NOW So hollow.  END
BEGIN NOW Such an echo.  END
BEGIN NOW So much smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW Why so much smoke> END
BEGIN NOW It's an external manifestation of the smouldering inner flame that we claim to be pursuing through our own dust filled bodies, END
BEGIN NOW pulling back scabs to peer into inner hidden cavities, filled only with smoke and cravings.  END
BEGIN NOW Little bug on the sidewalk being watched thinks he's the only one left in this post apocalyptic expanse. END
BEGIN NOW Must've ended recently, co0nsidering the smoky breeze. END
BEGIN NOW To survive, some rely on dagger laughter, staggering madly END
BEGIN NOW who are these post rapture cr4ackejack bastards? END
BEGIN NOW And why does their laughter win, echoing over this unquenchable din? END
BEGIN NOW Too late to begin again?  END
BEGIN NOW Too hollow and broken to build on> END
BEGIN NOW Is the stench too strong to sing through, or is it me, END
BEGIN NOW pointing madly at my own reflection, choking on my own demoniac laughter? END
BEGIN NOW This apocalypse seems to live in me, the anxiety a small dose of its smoke, END
BEGIN NOW The cravings a way to distract the bug and reinforce the hollowness. END
BEGIN NOW It's hard to let go of an echo, END
BEGIN NOW Anticipating it may be new this time, and if so I'll be the first to know. END
BEGIN NOW Breathe in love breathe out fear END
BEGIN NOW will it ever just be air?  END
BEGIN NOW Not caught on the edge of unluck or whipping up the dust of a thousand broken songs. END
BEGIN NOW Mere word choices angle the edges and flavor the air. END
BEGIN NOW Word choice based on echoes occurring in the highly complex confines of cortex. END
BEGIN NOW Yet it can't help but return to good or bad, alive or dead. END
BEGIN NOW And the one thing we can't seem to keep is our choice of words determines our type of experience. END
BEGIN NOW THIRD APPEAL END
BEGIN NOW And in that moment I glanced up and saw the croissant, held fast with plastic wrap, END
BEGIN NOW filed quietly behind the display glass, light falling on it like perfection. END
BEGIN NOW The presence and power of this croissant seems to echo deep and sweetly through me.  END
BEGIN NOW And the world expands, and softly I grin. END
BEGIN NOW But why the croissant? What truth does the flake butter pastry hold> END
BEGIN NOW And how does it relate to everything else in this shifting ring toss END
BEGIN NOW fall across yourself to pick up perfection and test it with the fiery kiss of cynicism.. END
BEGIN NOW Perhapst ehe plastic wrap adds glistening angelic depth, and display case lighting clarifies, it has earned its place. END
BEGIN NOW It's there to be sold, placed by haphazard underpaid help. END
BEGIN NOW Help that's been bought.  END
BEGIN NOW Help that might trade part of its pay for that very croissant. END
BEGIN NOW A tree reaches leaves to catch sunlight.  END
BEGIN NOW We sit beneath because it doesn't mind. END
BEGIN NOW At times we play these games to survive, others to just measure time. END
BEGIN NOW Today these sheets of paper pass through my mental breeze way and clear out my smoke. END
BEGIN NOW Random chatter, picking out bugs and food END
BEGIN NOW dust and human space and the dust of mood clouding a room, END
BEGIN NOW confusing in a very personal permanent way, confused a the permanence felt in this very room, END
BEGIN NOW as th8is very dust from this very mind mood settles, and the others are only aware that something unsettling has crept in, END
BEGIN NOW waiting for a breeze of quick distracting wind kiss to clear the air and clarify the here.  END
BEGIN NOW The croissant seems dead now. END
BEGIN NOW For all the lighting and layers of display all the vague references to its place as a luxury item END
BEGIN NOW And how that relays to its place and the people paid to present it, all those silly layers fall away, END
BEGIN NOW And once again it's just stupid food, and once again I'm just hungry. END
BEGIN NOW It seems to be hunger season.  END
BEGIN NOW But hunger dust will still leave with the breeze4. END
BEGIN NOW And when you compare you're not really here. END
BEGIN NOW You step inside to check your inner photo album against your skull window view. END
BEGIN NOW Your memories lay in cellophane coffins, you watch them, wishing they'd move. END
BEGIN NOW Your thoughts crawl up in front of your view. END
BEGIN NOW I had a croissant once.  END
BEGIN NOW Not much like that one.  END
BEGIN NOW This one crouched on the edge of the out front tables END
BEGIN NOW and caught the eye of every young dinner bun passing by. END
BEGIN NOW And you're hungry because you won't eat the strange unfamiliar treat in front of you. END
BEGIN NOW You hesitate because it's not quite the same.  END
BEGIN NOW shrink wrap memories play games switching in the wrong name. END
BEGIN NOW You hunger the safety of the prewritten way, you hunger the balance of fair play. END
BEGIN NOW You hesitate to sit because God knows what you might be crushing and who might wish you gone. END
BEGIN NOW But you're wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW They wish you here.  END
BEGIN NOW Back here. END
BEGIN NOW CHESS WITH CHECKERS END
BEGIN NOW Your patterns only exist inside you.  END
BEGIN NOW To assume they may be used as the basis or format of an exchange, END
BEGIN NOW be it conversation or otherwise, is to play chess with checkers. END
BEGIN NOW Something about how all of these thought were put down on the same paper, therefore they must be related. END
BEGIN NOW But perhaps there's no paper big enough to trace the extensive network. END
BEGIN NOW THE PERFECT INTRO END
BEGIN NOW I keep thinking there is a perfect intro that will make everything that follows just fall into place.  END
BEGIN NOW I've written about twenty intros so far, none of them justifying anything except perhaps a collection of intros, which is due to be release before this book.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be a very tidy and consistent collection of pieces relevant and related instead of this sprawling mass of whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW This book pile thing seems half cocked and falling over, just like everyhting else in my life.  END
BEGIN NOW So this intro is different, because fuck depth, and fuck intentionality, and fuck gumtpion, and fuck having access to the entirity of human accomplishment, and fhuck the continued dfevelopment of the pursuit of perfection and fuck trying to do b etter and make better and fuck tomrorrow and fuck yesterday, and fuck getting the fulcking spelling write, and fuck stupid run on rants that jsyut repeat the same childish resistance to finding what actually is.  END
BEGIN NOW So is that the point? Do I have a reason to string all these scrambled shit stains together now?  END
BEGIN NOW EUGENE END
BEGIN NOW THE SUMMER THAT DIDNT LAST FOREVER END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't everlasting either.  END
BEGIN NOW It was just summer.  END
BEGIN NOW Started early, ended late, so we thought it was forever.  END
BEGIN NOW But we were wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW That's how it goes.  END
BEGIN NOW We are small people, and forever is much bigger than us.  END
BEGIN NOW The summer started with me living in a garage, just like most of the things I'm involved in, fuckin garage.  END
BEGIN NOW I had done some barter work that I found on Craigslist, and got paid in a dip whistle.  END
BEGIN NOW I had designs to record some reggae tracks.  END
BEGIN NOW Than, something happened.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit, I haven't gotten that far yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing's happened yet.  END
BEGIN NOW WHATS IN FRONT OF YOU END
BEGIN NOW Is still like my madre use to say, "You take what's in front of you or you get nothing." But he doesn't know that.  END
BEGIN NOW Thas why he didn't stop.  END
BEGIN NOW The Hispanic prostitute looked after him, glancing down at her twin white poodles playing grab ass on the lawn. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't know because he's to active brain.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks it's over there and around the bend and not yet, because is not perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I coulda fucked him well.  END
BEGIN NOW I woulda surprised his little white ass.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicked her cigarette and stared absently down at the dogs, still immersed in their tussle END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't see me.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt his absence.  END
BEGIN NOW FEARSALE END
BEGIN NOW I wound up in a thrift store today.  END
BEGIN NOW A big ol' Saint Vinny's.Shit load of cowboy boots right at the front when you walk in.  END
BEGIN NOW Nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Springfield, Sweet Springfield, what did I ever do to thee? Thee northwest overcast sky was weighing down a bit extra today, mainly due to sleep deprivation, but I couldn't shrug it off.  END
BEGIN NOW So I wandered over to the book aisle and wandered up and down, unsure what to look for.  END
BEGIN NOW At first I opted for the book Kaol always knows he'll find, and I'm sure he'll find at least two more before he dies.  END
BEGIN NOW A first or second edition big book for A.A.  END
BEGIN NOW Sells for $60 or $70 online.  END
BEGIN NOW Buy it for a buck.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that reminds me.  END
BEGIN NOW I wrote down some titles to see how I am at picking random books.  END
BEGIN NOW See if I got a knack for spottin whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I did alright bowling today.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I'm good at spotting antiques too.  END
BEGIN NOW I found them on a bookshelf labeled "antique books" so they actually weren't that hard to spot.  END
BEGIN NOW All I had to do was pick out the titles to look up.  END
BEGIN NOW But before that, I was in the End Times section.  END
BEGIN NOW They have a whole friggen bookshelf dedicated to apocalypse prediction interpretations.  END
BEGIN NOW What a fascinating collection of absurd hyper fear joy games being spouted clouding the heads and energies of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW There is an antichrist and a false prophet and a beast, and this is the unholy trinity.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be a president who solves problems (yes, he has to actually solve problems) and than gets all crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's normal, right?  There is a house and a senate filled with representatives who tell the masses false promises, false predictions, behind the same veil of false change.  END
BEGIN NOW The False Prophet.And there is the judicial which is soon to be replaced by the military and or police.  END
BEGIN NOW The Beast.  END
BEGIN NOW There are 7 bowls to be poured out that do everything global warming promises to do.  END
BEGIN NOW All these little tidbits about how soon and in what form our demise might be brought about a shift in my mood.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW This author on the back is a fucking dirt bag who sells fear like it's bad tweak.  END
BEGIN NOW Or perhaps he believes it and feels compelled to study it, pressing on to glory in the graphic games that lie in store.  END
BEGIN NOW Or perhaps ...  END
BEGIN NOW perhaps it's just a job, and he just happened to acccidentally end up being an apocalypse expert.  END
BEGIN NOW And it's not soemthing that he's even necisarrily interested in.  END
BEGIN NOW And for some godless reason reading these predictions kinda cheered me up.  END
BEGIN NOW If I have a problem with it, well, maybe4 we'll all just fucking burn away in the sun when the sky opens up, eh? Or go subnterranean and grow web feet and have babies who grow gills.  END
BEGIN NOW Who fuycking cares.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm fucking not .  END
BEGIN NOW well, it';s interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW I gotta give it that.  END
BEGIN NOW Int4rpretign who an how and when, and there';s gonna be a tlaking statue of the antichrist who demands worship.  END
BEGIN NOW And .,..  END
BEGIN NOW and...  END
BEGIN NOW FUCK IT"S STEPHEN HAWKING! wait, is he dead? END
BEGIN NOW IDEAS END
BEGIN NOW I'm out of ideas.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and aint that it.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that first line might be the breaking point I've been looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting til I run out of ideas... END
BEGIN NOW And yet even now I'm toying with ideas about my lack of ideas.  END
BEGIN NOW I've been writing to myself again.  END
BEGIN NOW I believe that's the problem.  END
BEGIN NOW No audience in mind, no friend I'm hoping will chuckle at this.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the thought that I'll come back and look at this again.  END
BEGIN NOW God, what an empty pitiful space.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a short little masturbatory loop to keep me spinning my wheels until the friction kills me.  END
BEGIN NOW Spin your wheels.  END
BEGIN NOW Show the world how your friction feels. END
BEGIN NOW Shine your eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Share the length and depth of your lies.  END
BEGIN NOW Show your teeth but not to me not to me. END
BEGIN NOW (this last line is supposed to be me bashing my fists on the keyboard and breaking it in half and throwing it across the room, but i'm in the library right now.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a decent library.  END
BEGIN NOW i wish I weren't such a fucktard these days.  END
BEGIN NOW I might actually like it.  END
BEGIN NOW the shelves are blond wood, and the ceiling is stained one by fours.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess blonde wood is alright for a public library. END
BEGIN NOW pursuits of interconnectedness through expressions of self obsession.  END
BEGIN NOW less meaningful scrappy shit pickets crawling from broken teeth torn wellspout. END
BEGIN NOW i shrink to know what might be hid in these random... END
BEGIN NOW This is fucking meaningless.  END
BEGIN NOW This is fucking meaningless.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not doing a fucking thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not even enjoying myself. END
BEGIN NOW At least when other people run away they fucking enjoy it.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't even    ... END
BEGIN NOW Am I missing something? Was there some fucking round of paperwork I never filled out or a bus I didn't get on?  END
BEGIN NOW Thousands upon thousands of these things lay scrabbled out behind me like shit stain pain face GOD FUCKING DAMMIT END
BEGIN NOW PART FOUR :: THE FALLING NOTES END
BEGIN NOW What compels you? What pulls you along into chaotic improvisation? What will prompt change? The recognition of repitition.  END
BEGIN NOW What might prompt you? Finding a clue as to your own completion. END
BEGIN NOW Iǘe never had the notion to force my own reality, rather letting the wind decide where ought I abide.  END
BEGIN NOW But too many times falling into scenarios headspac4es games and emotional mazes, too long have I lived at the whim of whoever happens along.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel compelled to write a book that will change me.  END
BEGIN NOW A book that will document what has changed me.  END
BEGIN NOW To study that which changes us and makes us whatever we become.  END
BEGIN NOW A study of internal mechanisms.  END
BEGIN NOW Triggers and modifications.  END
BEGIN NOW improvisiations and repititions.  END
BEGIN NOW To live in anticipation of the next complication is to be always falling.  END
BEGIN NOW To wait with baited breath at what might come next is to live in perpetual displacement., struck speechle3ss by the onslaught of untraceable elements.  END
BEGIN NOW To study the passage of the past two months, to project it in comparison to the last two years and to superimpose that over this last decade of personal development is my goal in this writing project.  END
BEGIN NOW Two months ago I left California to work on a farm in Oregon for a month.  END
BEGIN NOW Get perspective on the vector I have become.  END
BEGIN NOW To trace my Billy Circus maze through landscapes and head space. END
BEGIN NOW During my time on the farm I learned to fall back into myself without getting lost in who I once was.  END
BEGIN NOW Through this came such realizations as sthe art of rambling tends to interfere with subject matter.  END
BEGIN NOW The only hope is that it loops back around and justifys itself.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again itś a coffee shop scene.  END
BEGIN NOW Quite the recurring setting.  END
BEGIN NOW P[ossibly the only recurring element in this ramble.  END
BEGIN NOW Todays is the Felton Remembers Parade.  END
BEGIN NOW Fade backwards through a series of effectst hat emphasizes displacement, spiral zoom simultaneously in on a passing crow and a lollipop. END
BEGIN NOW I must remind myself Iḿ putting this together for myself and must align it with waht I find compelling and proper.  END
BEGIN NOW i cannot become clouded with commercial viability or perpoetual appeal.  END
BEGIN NOW I cannot write an intro to the reader, only and intro to myself about what patterns and approaches can be expected.  END
BEGIN NOW At one point this project was called the premature memoirs, but it hafter working on it for 10 years Iǘe renamed it the perpetual memoirs.  END
BEGIN NOW My goal in writing and compilng this is to track the change of voice over the course of a decade under constantexperimentation and displacement.  END
BEGIN NOW The outcome will be nothing more than a collection of things which is one of the many working titles I´ve given this project.  END
BEGIN NOW CEASE THE RAMBLE! ON WITH IT! END
BEGIN NOW ẗracin patterns in the sand. END
BEGIN NOW screamin noise into the wind END
BEGIN NOW let it all just fall down END
BEGIN NOW into the mess that it is. END
BEGIN NOW He walks around like a haunted man.  END
BEGIN NOW He has thoughts that wont come out.  END
BEGIN NOW LImp are his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW His pace is plodding.  END
BEGIN NOW his pale lips give shallow breath.  END
BEGIN NOW He is the century son.  END
BEGIN NOW He has seen it stretching thin.  END
BEGIN NOW The membrane shudders with his tired whisper.  END
BEGIN NOW ¨¨¨¨ I know not what to burn.  END
BEGIN NOW ¨¨¨ END
BEGIN NOW ¨¨ bring me diamond souls that once awoke my faith, that we might burn together, for all is fire.¨¨¨ END
BEGIN NOW He counts the calls of a crow.  END
BEGIN NOW Four loud, two soft.  END
BEGIN NOW sixteen loud, two soft.  END
BEGIN NOW fourteen loud, two soft.  END
BEGIN NOW He creates a ramble that he himself cannot follow, sure that it holds clues as to what he might be trying to say, somethign he himself doesnt know.  END
BEGIN NOW  Itś not just noise, nor is it a game, but he plays at both, finding clues and ways to breath.  END
BEGIN NOW He digs away at his diamond of pain, feeling the noise and nonsense fade.  END
BEGIN NOW Why these games of solitude? From whence these trimmings of death?  END
BEGIN NOW This is all big talk, and it chokes us.  END
BEGIN NOW Only big talk and it wall always be toppling over its own realizations.  END
BEGIN NOW No small talk to cushion dilute and soothe, only reeling realizations, and we quickly become old and hopeless, casting off the flimsy expression of our fellow mortals, condemning our own brief forays into amiable interaction. END
BEGIN NOW I seek that which is END
BEGIN NOW But is it found in my past, END
BEGIN NOW some unfounded future, END
BEGIN NOW or within the folds of the book I refuse to write? END
BEGIN NOW You can only be sure of one thing at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW We step from truth to truth like stones in a river.  END
BEGIN NOW I know that thes thoughts are mine.  END
BEGIN NOW I know that Iǘe been pulled taut and tired like the skin of a ballook, and soon release will send me spitting wet breath around the room, and I might be left at a book signing table, my wrinkled balloon face blank and faithless.  END
BEGIN NOW I fear the pen for it steals my brain and leaves it stained there for others to play with.  END
BEGIN NOW I fear the page for the imprint, the soul print it keeps it holds in infamy.  END
BEGIN NOW For the mark you leave is all that you take with you.  END
BEGIN NOW My deep talk is filled with pretentiousness.  END
BEGIN NOW My snmall talk thin and unambitious.  END
BEGIN NOW Iǘe lost somehting.  END
BEGIN NOW I don know what.  END
BEGIN NOW But Iḿ sure that it isn o longer where it was.  END
BEGIN NOW The truth moves and stagnation is death.  END
BEGIN NOW And falling is that which is between what was and whatś next.  END
BEGIN NOW I can hold on no longer.  END
BEGIN NOW Let the falling begin. END
BEGIN NOW My name is Michael and I wrote this book.  END
BEGIN NOW I struggle with writing because my internal narrator cannot agree with my internal teleprompter who blames the big producer in the sky who sent down his only begotten script writer, and in the end we are but ashes in the can.  END
BEGIN NOW The old man is me criticizing and derailing and rearranging my work.  END
BEGIN NOW This effort is aimed at what might prompt continued writings, and how one might come upon their natural style and subject matter.  END
BEGIN NOW This prompts the question of whether the term ¨natural" can be applied to creation or whether we are resisting the stage direction of the only begotten script writer. END
BEGIN NOW What to write is the most constant and absurd question.  END
BEGIN NOW This book (or at least this section of the book) approaches this question by first exagerating it, and than ignoring it.  END
BEGIN NOW Iĺl write about Writing, Science Fiction, Action Adventure, Romance, and Mystery.  END
BEGIN NOW Why? Because to troly be real it must reference everything.  END
BEGIN NOW There is but one genre, that of expression.  END
BEGIN NOW And since the goal is to hold your attention, all else is oh so very Irrelevant.  END
BEGIN NOW The old man took my notebook and began to read aloud... END
BEGIN NOW ¨¨¨ And language ist he biggest falacy of all, because we consider it to be us expressing ourselves, but it is the world using us to express Itself.  END
BEGIN NOW We are the medium and therefore we assume to have access to the message, which causes a hyperactive anxiety, because the message is not found in language, but in our actions.  END
BEGIN NOW A list is a mechanism for coping with anxiety.  END
BEGIN NOW It is a way for the individual to remind themselves that they know what they are doing. END
BEGIN NOW A list is useless if one lacks the capacity to cease the analytical intellect and move into a mechanical intellect in the form of literal action.  END
BEGIN NOW These words feel sleek, shiny, dispassionate metal.  END
BEGIN NOW This analysis of functionalist expression is as thin and flat as any to do list, and the shift int o a self referencing narrational voice is as predictable as pickle juice in a pickle jar. END
BEGIN NOW These words are paper; flat and dry.  END
BEGIN NOW Ityś the curse that haunted many past authors: the fear that everything is predictable.  END
BEGIN NOW The growing awareness that many people have many petty expressions of self obsession, but we prive in our narrations that we are the most self absorbed of them all.  END
BEGIN NOW A subtle play, when he mentions and emphasizes that which they lack, he is suggesting that he has the answer.  END
BEGIN NOW Is this the role of a social critic? To analyze archetypes and condemn cultural role playing? END
BEGIN NOW Or is the only real point skittering right now along the thin blue horizon that balances the stream of ball point bile. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps itś a new style that youŕe prefecting.  END
BEGIN NOW Or perhaps itś been so long since inscription amplified your thoughts and youǘe forgotten, the only way to find it is to get lost in the flowing tumble of word sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Same choice a thousand times a day, whether it makes any sense or is necisarry.  END
BEGIN NOW The other option is how itś all so wonderfully obtuse, camping on the edge of guild and logic until life overwhelms and we find ourselves falling along in unison towards the totally unexpected.  END
BEGIN NOW If itś an exercise or an expulsion of demons, it needs to be done.  END
BEGIN NOW I seem only to glorify the act, and truly I am lost as to what the subjct matter might be proper aside from the act of expression. END
BEGIN NOW This seems to be another lesson test experiment.  END
BEGIN NOW A flow of automatic thought aimed at repitition with variation.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it 12 or 18 basic plot lines? And what are the 9 major archetypes? And what religion does the Italian clown tradition correspond with again?  END
BEGIN NOW Take any words and youĺl find them aligned in dozens of origins and part of all the same vague ¨beyond the blue" game.  END
BEGIN NOW Already heś showing signs of idiocy.  END
BEGIN NOW He shakes his fist at the ceiling every night before bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Heś lost the power to express.  END
BEGIN NOW His fists are dry and cracked from working his back is stiff his spit is thick.  END
BEGIN NOW Similarly clogged are his capacities to process. END
BEGIN NOW He spits his ferocious raspiness and his audience laughs at the cracks in his voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Heś been nursing and growing his furious noise, but before he unleashes he must learn to turn it away from his pitiable fellow humans and towards the buildings and plans, traditions and practices that keep them stifled dull and lifeless.  END
BEGIN NOW i sat with stifled humanity for a spell and convinced myself that everything was doing quite well.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I'm trying too hard, maybe I'm not trying at all.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe all my efforts go into all the wrong tasks, a set of perfectly polished tools, and not a scrap of meterial to work.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't let them ever tell you you're smart.  END
BEGIN NOW Don;t listen when they say you're gifted.  END
BEGIN NOW It's their only way to destroy your joy : Encase it in trimmings which grow into obligations.  END
BEGIN NOW The servant who buried his talent is a wicked servant, while the servant who multiplied his talents is worthy in the eyes of the lord.  END
BEGIN NOW Diversification prevaricates longevity.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus was a stockbroker! END
BEGIN NOW Am I trying too hard or not hard enough? We've tried at many things and ended up getting somewhere serval times, but energy is always slipshod, and delivery scrambled and stuttering.  END
BEGIN NOW Creative expressionw as the goal.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been for years.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever since we filmed Hail Norton, a homework assignment that began with the goal of being a five minute fellini esque short, but quickly spiraled into 25 minutes of rambling randomness, moving between time periods and character sets and story lines and symbologies, and ambiance effects and such adn so on.  END
BEGIN NOW The central message was something about art for arts sake.  END
BEGIN NOW The opening quote was ... END
BEGIN NOW "Consistency is not as important as the energy of a story." END
BEGIN NOW and the closing quote was END
BEGIN NOW "If we stop moving now we may never move again!" END
BEGIN NOW So it seems fitting that this film project should figure prominently in the decade of displacement.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose evertyones goal int he twenties is to get back home, whatever that means.  END
BEGIN NOW Rediscover, reinvent home.  END
BEGIN NOW But I've been stuck ever since graduating, pursuing this whole bullshit success thing.  END
BEGIN NOW It has sapped me of creative energies, crippled my self esteem, and repeateldly launched me chatocially nowhere.  END
BEGIN NOW My goal has always been tow rite, even the wrong stuff! Even the badly written stuff! It's a demonstration! Or it juxtaposes the silence! Or it forces ther eader to acknowledge the literal flesh and blood humanity of the author.  END
BEGIN NOW 	QUANTUM END
BEGIN NOW INTRO---------------------------------------------------------------- END
BEGIN NOW 	Prompt :  EVERYTHING is prayer. END
BEGIN NOW Whether you look at the screen when you type, sending your awareness towards, praying to technology, END
BEGIN NOW Whether you stare forward over the screen out into the room, out the window into the world, out the world over the horizon into the next idea, praying to potential, END
BEGIN NOW Whether you close your eyes or have had them closed for you and bask praying to the abstract capacities of the human mind to prompt and perpetuate realms logics and experiences that aren’t literally occurring, praying to thought, END
BEGIN NOW Whether you stare at the keys observing each symbol, watching the fingers fall gracefully into place, ticka rattle tatata tating, praying to the synthesis of thought, technology, and potential, END
BEGIN NOW Or if you type one word at a time, one thought, one moment, and glance around the room, pausing, waiting, noticing one perfect item or thought to be encased in digital space heavy with pause, moving slow enough to pray to the entire universe.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ll talk more about that later.  END
BEGIN NOW 	UNDERLYING MECHANISMS END
BEGIN NOW Autonomous Education  (A.E.)  END
BEGIN NOW Creative Expressions Therapy.  END
BEGIN NOW (C.E.T.) END
BEGIN NOW 	To develop and present these concepts, fictional characters are made to discuss the subject matter, so that each one can fully believe whatever thoughts I'm toying with, leaving me free to continue my cynical predilection.  END
BEGIN NOW The characters provide an actual demonstration of how one might use self guided education techniques (A.E.) to develop their own course of C.E.T.  END
BEGIN NOW which results in a more intentional version of self that is more capable of contributing positively to their surroundings. END
BEGIN NOW 	ONE LAST TIME END
BEGIN NOW 	What follows is a series of psychological proposals developed by the author over the last ten years aimed at helping writers churn up their inner whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW They occur in the form of character fictions which embody various personality traits and or belief systems the author has contemplated acquiring, studying the effects of traits on types and systems on specifics in the realm of personality, and how it is embodied in the various realms of acquaintancehood.  END
BEGIN NOW Rest assured, the author is much more sane than when he started this project, which is proof that it's a worthy endeavour to chore through the chapters and prompts.  END
BEGIN NOW Join me, dear reader, in the sacred role of scribe, and take the prompts I've gathered to trigger your own streams of expression and awareness.  END
BEGIN NOW And send them to me at slightlydistracted@hotmail.com so that I may bask in the onslaught of absurdity I hope to have triggered. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER ONE ---- CALL ON THE MUSE END
BEGIN NOW 	An ancient tradition of epic poetry and such is the call on the muse.  END
BEGIN NOW This is an almost impossible task for the excessively cynical or logical, because the muse is that experience which frees us from such anchors of expression.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Bastard struggles to understand this summons, which makes him incapable of truly experiencing it.  END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter seems to be permenantly in the company of the muse, which is why he never writes anything down : Because to him it never seems temporary.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Those who wish to follow along and duplicate the prompts are advised to find a pastoral setting, hypnotize yourself, (see appendix : self hypnosis) and when word thoughts become thin and ignorable, seek out that which prompts your very existence and thus might prompt the epic expressions fermenting inside of you. END
BEGIN NOW 	Jack the Bastard sat down once more and began ticka tap rattle smashing the letters of the keys of the board, as if the impact of each symbolic drop onto each letter shape might summon more momentum and keep him launching on into the sea of expression he so longed to drown in floundering sputtering hounding the siren of sound prompting thought ensuring the enduring analog digital abstract literal dance between thought and occurence.  END
BEGIN NOW Peter came dancing into the room, doing sloppy twirls with a sleek shoot of crystal encasing a throatful of champagne.  END
BEGIN NOW Eleven, and already the monkey is high as a kite on his bubbly.  END
BEGIN NOW Must be a sale at Rocky Lickers.  END
BEGIN NOW "Come dance, Jack! Dance to your youth, and MY Beauty! Dance for it is the spring of our lives and we shall not be trod on by winners filling us losers with their discontent." END
BEGIN NOW "Hangonhangonhangon! I'm trying to write.  END
BEGIN NOW Quit your monologue and lemme finish." Eyes still on his typing, he plunged his attention further, seemingly through the paper, like a martial artist throwing blows beyond the target.  END
BEGIN NOW "You'll never make it if all you do is try! DO!"  END
BEGIN NOW "Enough of that shit.  END
BEGIN NOW There's nothing left to "DO!" These scrambley Scribbled Ramblings sound like some adolescent homage to our wholely unwholesome host of scribularium of America.  END
BEGIN NOW The poems , ...  END
BEGIN NOW oh lord.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't get me started on the poems.  END
BEGIN NOW Pure shit.  END
BEGIN NOW giggley swooney phermone junk." END
BEGIN NOW Peter lowered his bubbly down from aloft, holding it at his teat like a babe.  END
BEGIN NOW "You try for things you don't do naturally.  END
BEGIN NOW You always have.  END
BEGIN NOW If you allowed yourself to simply fall into what mess may come.." END
BEGIN NOW "I'd end up like you!" Jack said looking up accusingly. END
BEGIN NOW "Oh! God forbid! I don't mean as a lifestyle.  END
BEGIN NOW The daily choice of freefall is one which only those who have been chosen can survive.  END
BEGIN NOW Touched by an angel you know.  END
BEGIN NOW Dropped on my head." END
BEGIN NOW "You are different people one moment to the next."  END
BEGIN NOW "That's an ugly way of saying it.  END
BEGIN NOW I am wholely here whenever I want.  END
BEGIN NOW Dropping my concept of self as easy as a cape with a crap design on the back.  END
BEGIN NOW And when I return in two months time, you'll only know my eyes, for all else that might signify self will have changed.  END
BEGIN NOW And I will pity you, oh sadly consistent.  END
BEGIN NOW Mocking me as I climb from monkey form to monkey form, the scales fallen from my eyes, and you, oh sad scalely lizard creature, too encased in armor to bend gracefully enough to soften and feel the sun and reach and grown and shrink and glow with the true god of intentional evolution physical mental and spiritual." Peter had been walking slowly in a circle, examining each of the walls as he slowly sank towards the floor, ending his speech by slumping into a crosslegged seat, chin to his chest, shoulders slumped foreward, his flute of white now empty and sideways on the tattered mexican blanket rug.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack suddenly realized why he loved and hated peter so immensely.  END
BEGIN NOW Its not my job to write down all the poetry! Why do you drop these words on the floor and drift into silent oblivion? God knows where your mind goes after such displays of poignancy.  END
BEGIN NOW Why do you cast your pearls, not even before swine, but randomly, as if they might continue to flow forever.  END
BEGIN NOW As if these werent the jewels of eternity popping up into our daily language before we can even recognize, only when we're not searching for it, DAMMIT!! What the hell did he just say?! I'll capture the edge of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Some lateral issue....  END
BEGIN NOW   I hate his monologues.  END
BEGIN NOW 'cause he doesn't write 'em down.  END
BEGIN NOW You can't just drool one out like a street schizo and let it drift oft into the nethersphere.  END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW I guess that's why I keep him around.  END
BEGIN NOW What can I salvage from that?... END
BEGIN NOW (from the desk of J.T.B.  END
BEGIN NOW Esq) END
BEGIN NOW This contemporary age is ruled by a fear of literal existence.  END
BEGIN NOW A hesitance to take an intimate hand in our setting, striking up the odd vibration to tap into literally taking part in our actual existence.  END
BEGIN NOW The infinite and unpredictable external stimuli that assault us throughout our daily lives.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever syllables you choose to decorate the concept, it seems at times to be resisting life itself.  END
BEGIN NOW Could it be..  END
BEGIN NOW a fear? Of feeling? No! I feel things!  END
BEGIN NOW "What does the inside of your jacket feel like? how bout the chair you're sitting on? what does the mouse feel like in your hand? the keys beneath your fingers? the toes choked up with cotton inside your socks, crammed into shapely mini-hills with your shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW You sir, are a piece of architecture.  END
BEGIN NOW Put together through a delicate lack of structural awareness, draped over with ignorant semi-random textiles.  END
BEGIN NOW We only feel what we leave exposed, leaving 97% of our body permanently exposed to constant friction contact and suffocation with excessive layering and protections against the very necessary weathers that our bodies are kept in shape by.  END
BEGIN NOW The salt water of the ocean naturally detoxifies the body, the wind ruffles and softens hair and relaxes the muscles and prompts blood flow while keeping the air fresh and crucial.  END
BEGIN NOW The further from nature we get the less we want to feel, the more layers we put on, the more buildings walls and fences there are between us and the non-concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack leaned back perusing his words, unhappy.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt a presence.  END
BEGIN NOW glancing up sharply, he nearly collided with Peter who was reading over his shoulder, his head perched several inches from Jack's, hovering like a conscience.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack felt slightly invaded.  END
BEGIN NOW "You're a nudist!" offered Peter jovially.  END
BEGIN NOW "You've just come out of the...  END
BEGIN NOW outfit." He began twirling again, this time throwing off pieces of clothing.  END
BEGIN NOW A hat went one way.  END
BEGIN NOW a glove from his pocket flew another.  END
BEGIN NOW His second glove threw a third way, his scarf a fourth.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack spun around in his chair to address the verbal assailant. END
BEGIN NOW "You misunderstand.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not advocating nubidy.  END
BEGIN NOW The layers are a metaphor.  END
BEGIN NOW You can't be so literal." END
BEGIN NOW "Nah.  END
BEGIN NOW All metaphors are literal.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's not a metaphor." Peters eyes were doing that slide to the right, jump left, slide to the right, jump left thing that eyes do inside of a head that's recently been spinning.  END
BEGIN NOW He was temporarily silenced by the swirling, giving Jack a chance to explain.  END
BEGIN NOW "We keep our most sensitive self safe and unseen at all times.  END
BEGIN NOW The mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Thus it must be with our external selves, letting part, some, even most show throughout the day, but our bodies, like our minds are made up of such an array that to prompt all senses simultaneously will leave the self raw and eventually calloused.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps we keep nudity as a special occurrence because that way nudity can act as its own aphrodisiac, keeping such things as simply and natural as anyone might prefer." Peter's brow furrowed.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't like logic to prevail.  END
BEGIN NOW Life is emotion.  END
BEGIN NOW a series of shifting swirling systems that one would be a fool to cling to, and Jack wasn't going to win this one with his advocacy of fear and the reductive shirking lifestyle logic.  END
BEGIN NOW He retorted; END
BEGIN NOW "And perHAPS you just need to get past the death shroud of guilt you've nurtured throughout your life towards the glorious form that we have been graced with...  END
BEGIN NOW If you can shrug off the putrid cape of shame that makes you hide your sensitivities lest those who run these systems that feed and shelter us might cast a dark eye on us for neglecting to hide in shame our opinions and our fleshy things." END
BEGIN NOW "Our opinions and our fleshy things.  END
BEGIN NOW very nice.  END
BEGIN NOW But shouldn't we rather be cherishing our opinions and fleshy things? Cherishing them by protecting them from they that might threaten becoming so wholely immersed in your new motherlife world realm that you were incapable of keeping in touch with said old realm or any sort of seperate concept of self which is a very useful tool in the search for truth, even if the rumor about it being an illusion is true." END
BEGIN NOW "Aw Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Man!! You semantician.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm a fuckin poet and you're taking me to court.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is this.  END
BEGIN NOW fuckin inquisition over here."  END
BEGIN NOW "No! It's crucial.  END
BEGIN NOW What, you scared to be exposed? Mental nudity? Exposure of your true core concepts? Can you take it?" END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER TWO :: THEO JAMES AND THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EXPRESSION END
BEGIN NOW 	Theo James is the teacher of our two heros, and the source of their befuddling assignments.  END
BEGIN NOW As a fresh mind in a dead world, Professor James struggles to fit or to be understood or to prompt anything fresh from the mid twenties child minds he's confronted with daily.  END
BEGIN NOW His experience with students has brought him to the belief that the best thing a teacher can do is to excite the student into self propelled education.  END
BEGIN NOW This being his goal, it's also his approach, which causes his subject matters to become rather convoluted and innertwined.  END
BEGIN NOW 	To duplicate this prompt, find your three favorite subjects and improvise a lecture connecting these unrelated disciplines.  END
BEGIN NOW (anthropology, graphic arts, psychology, fishing, whatever) jot down notes on each, find a podium with no audience (its much harder to improvise connections between unrelated disciplines when people are watching) and record yourself explaining why these three topics can be used as the basis for a complete understanding of how and why the world works or doesn't work. END
BEGIN NOW 	"Doctor Theo James will be speaking to you today class.  END
BEGIN NOW He's a very old friend of mine and an expert in the field of Social Self Psychology, which is the least paying job in the field, so give him an extra rousing round of applause, as it's the least we can do to gesture our appreciation.  END
BEGIN NOW Mister James?" END
BEGIN NOW 	A rattle eyed fifty year old approached the stage, shifting his brown corduroy coat and scratching behind his ear and under his thin unkempt beard.  END
BEGIN NOW He grabbed the mic and talked sideways into it, always looking towards the wings, never directly at the actual group of about a thousand students attending the psychology summit.  END
BEGIN NOW 	"He's right! The janitors get paid more than me at the place I'm working." James said, an affable sense of buoyant humor behind his depressing revelation.  END
BEGIN NOW "But I guess I'm a janitor too.  END
BEGIN NOW I go around and clean up peoples mental shits.  END
BEGIN NOW Our brains, like our bodies, have many toxins and biproducts that require daily expulsion.  END
BEGIN NOW just like our bodyshits, our brainshits require specific setting and stimuli to be extracted in a healthy manner. END
BEGIN NOW 	"Those in labor and service often times have less constapation, along with a more stable family life.  END
BEGIN NOW Inversely, those in management positions show higher signs of intestinal disruption paired with a tendency to force shows of small talk good spirits from the plebians.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah...  END
BEGIN NOW sweet plebia.  END
BEGIN NOW Font of my youth... END
BEGIN NOW 	"I rode the bus here today, I enjoy the bus because it's the most intimate experience of the city.  END
BEGIN NOW It's often times the more poor half of the area but these folk tend to be more inclined to take part in their surroundings and take part in some form of community..." Doctor J.  END
BEGIN NOW shuffled his papers and glanced around the pulpit looking for some clue as to what he was there to discuss.  END
BEGIN NOW "...community, historic context..  END
BEGIN NOW diversif..  END
BEGIN NOW AH!!  That WAS it.  END
BEGIN NOW I was right after all.  END
BEGIN NOW Why do the lower economic ranks tend to be more community oriented?" a pleased chuckle was heard through the audience.  END
BEGIN NOW James glanced around to see what they found amusing.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Back to the presentation.  END
BEGIN NOW He approached the giant whiteboard and wrote in foot high letters END
BEGIN NOW " TRAUMANOMICS " END
BEGIN NOW stepped back, smiled, nodded, and turned back to the pulpit.  END
BEGIN NOW "Traumanomics dictates a fear based investment strategy that fails to diversify in times of need.  END
BEGIN NOW This demonstrates an economic and social involvement that is purely motivated by self interest with self deprecating shortsightedness..." The place was dead silent.  END
BEGIN NOW  ot the sound of a pen scratching.  END
BEGIN NOW only Theo James scratching.  END
BEGIN NOW "Didja get that?" A thousand students shook their head no in unison.  END
BEGIN NOW James looked down, than back at the white board.  END
BEGIN NOW 10, 20, 30 seconds.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally he burst into movement, drawing shapes on the board.  END
BEGIN NOW the shapes seemed almost meaningless, only serving to keep his hand moving to keep his brain moving so that he wouldn't get overrun by the thought process, rather oscillating between a literal occurrence and an abstract one that might hopefully somehow naturally parallel each other.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't sure what he was doing.  END
BEGIN NOW He had just forgotten to write notes on a presentation, since he'd been losing sleep over the phenomenon of the inconsistent self.  END
BEGIN NOW  This concept seemed crux in approaching education, job placement, rehabilitation, family psychology, and everything it means to be human.  END
BEGIN NOW It all seemed to him inextricably bound to this notion that one can be a self and a speck simultaneously and without cognitive dissonance, rather identifying the cognitive dissonance as coming from a system that is incapable of approaching this inevitable truth.  END
BEGIN NOW 	"Alright! Traumanomics.  END
BEGIN NOW The bombs all go off! Everything dies.  END
BEGIN NOW The only ones who survive are in this very room.  END
BEGIN NOW you thousand students, and me, your leader! In this case I expect to be ousted from my role quite quickly, looking around the room I see approximately a thousand better leaders.  END
BEGIN NOW I am just a professional student who demonstrates the act of learning for you enthusiastic students.  END
BEGIN NOW Thus, I am no leader.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a doctor.  END
BEGIN NOW Who will lead? the poet? the warrior? the business man? It doesn't matter.  END
BEGIN NOW The students will build the world, as they always do.  END
BEGIN NOW And their bosses will steal the credit.  END
BEGIN NOW As they always have.  END
BEGIN NOW 	And so! What world shall we build, my humble leaders? No plants will grow.  END
BEGIN NOW No green plants anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the corn.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the ten thousand acres of Monsanto Corn grown subterraneanly in this very soil.  END
BEGIN NOW The corn potatoe.  END
BEGIN NOW Corayto.  END
BEGIN NOW A strange invention, but the first post nuclear vegetable created by man, and quite possibly our salvation.  END
BEGIN NOW And so! we will create a system of credits.  END
BEGIN NOW There are enough coraytos for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW And we shall all get our share of 350 coraytos which will last each person long enough to learn to hunt and find buried seeds that they might cultivate in the rare untouched scraps of earth with life still in it."  END
BEGIN NOW 	Doctor James stared down at the stage, slightly swaying, as if he'd put himself in a trance.  END
BEGIN NOW His head shook gently side to side.  END
BEGIN NOW And with a quick twitch he was back.  END
BEGIN NOW "AND SOME! Some there will be who find uses for the corayto that no other could find.  END
BEGIN NOW The inside of the skin can be preserved in the green leaves, buried three feet deep, surrounded by gravel beneath and a bark lid above to keep the dirt out.  END
BEGIN NOW and when it has sat for a week or more, it can be undug and used as a bandage of sorts.  END
BEGIN NOW The stalks can be textiled and woven into string into yarn into clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW The leaves can thatch roofing.  END
BEGIN NOW The flesh of the fruit can be used as bait in hunting.  END
BEGIN NOW The leaf and the root when boiled release their bitterness and become palatable, otherwise causing severe stomach crampings.  END
BEGIN NOW The flesh of the root will sooth burns, the skin of the root will treat rashes.  END
BEGIN NOW It makes tolerable beer, if hop extract and yeast are to be had, and the moonshine it makes is fire.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Perhaps one person could manage to think of all these uses, but even so, the infrastructure is too diverse and extensive.  END
BEGIN NOW If we do not gather together, the thousand of us, make a list of our various capacities, another list of what we believe to be important, and a third list of what we think we need, and use these three lists to triangulate several interlinked ideology groupings inside of which will be several implementology groupings, inside of which will be several expertise groupings...  END
BEGIN NOW uh oh.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel zombie eyes on the back of my neck." Theo James glanced back from his drawing, at the students who were looking a bit befuddled.  END
BEGIN NOW So he drew three circles, and within each circle, he drew three more circles, and within those circles, he drew three more circles.  END
BEGIN NOW 	"In our current universe these various realms, looks like there's twenty seven of em.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno though.  END
BEGIN NOW depends on how you look at it.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, the three big circles are the three big ideologies." He began writing long drawn out titles next to each large circle. END
BEGIN NOW 1: This life is life, and to deny that is to die to life. END
BEGIN NOW 2: I owe my life to my ancestors and I must understand my role as a link. END
BEGIN NOW 3: This life is imbued with the mystery of existence which we are meant to pursue as a groom pursues his new bride naked through the primeval woods. END
BEGIN NOW James stepped back and looked at what he had just written.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked back at the students who were more baffled than when he had started.  END
BEGIN NOW 	"Uh...  END
BEGIN NOW Traumanomics dictates a reductive experience of reality which means we as individuals allow ourselves to only inhabit one of these three spheres, when this actually cuts us off from a full understanding of our potential and capacities and true self, which is not meant to be consistent, because it is a verb, and those with a static self are those who are more inclined to destroy themselves and those around them." END
BEGIN NOW 	It was as though a very heavy thick shroud of existential dilemma had been lifted.  END
BEGIN NOW  Theo glanced around happily.  END
BEGIN NOW "Did it make sense?! Did it make sense?!" The students were sighing and sitting back, slumping.  END
BEGIN NOW Theo continued mumbling to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW "They listened.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole room listened!! I only wish I could remember what I said! I hope it was good." As they gushed out clacking and stomping, he remembered to call out "DONT FORGET THE HOMEWORK! TWO PAGES ON WHAT CLOTHES DO TO THEIR OCCUPANTS."  END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER THREE :: OUTFIT AS INPUT EQUALS UNFIT OUTPUT END
BEGIN NOW 	To get a better understanding of our internal mechanisms its helpful to observe the external results.  END
BEGIN NOW The most obvious and constant representation of this is the clothes we choose to wear.  END
BEGIN NOW Put on the outfit of the person you want to be, and simply observe its effects on you.  END
BEGIN NOW start literal, with how it changes your posture, breathing patterns, and visual focus point.  END
BEGIN NOW This struggle to exist within some other creature's confines tends to result in a rather unexpected back and forth between the conscious and subconscious mind, and perhaps this is the crux of our biscuit :::  END
BEGIN NOW o trigger a conversation between our conscious and our subconscious minds.  END
BEGIN NOW so here goes jack, trying to be a grown up, wearing his grandfather's suit and a rabbit fur hat.  END
BEGIN NOW (He never really explained the rabbit fur hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps its a linus blanket left over from his childhood)  END
BEGIN NOW 	get that top button.  END
BEGIN NOW  ow tuck in the front, feel it tighten.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a finely sprung tuning fork.  END
BEGIN NOW feel the pleats of your pants remind your legs what straight is.  END
BEGIN NOW and the soles of your shoes, grounding your stance.  END
BEGIN NOW the drape of your coat against your back, pulling the chest tight up and back, opening the airways, sending the gaze strangely spacedly into nowhere.  END
BEGIN NOW the soft rabbit fur hat pressed against my eyes still feels a bit like an animal, but it doesn't reek of death like one would expect from the shreds of a carcass.  END
BEGIN NOW the leather and rubber of shoe feel like knobby tool fixtures, easily replaced with a flat head or a phillips.  END
BEGIN NOW All these details, down to the parts of my hand that feel most cold, top of my three big knuckles, and the underside of my left pointer.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose there's some heirarchy there.  END
BEGIN NOW My left pointer seems the most susceptible to cold, while my right pointer is still stiff and frictious from the hand saw injury.  END
BEGIN NOW enough of self observing self.  END
BEGIN NOW the body responds to the subconscious demand for the thoughts to become ticky tacked out into some resemblance of biproduct.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is he doing? observing the observer being observed.  END
BEGIN NOW What about this crux is so fixatable for him.? Does he consider it a double blind test of humanity as a whole? to constantly talke one step to the left and turn around? does this do anything aside from confuse and perpetuate an instable concept of reality? END
BEGIN NOW And can this be considered a writing style? To put on a nice suit, comb the hair, get all church spiffy, and sit at the alter of expression blindfolded? You're chasing your tail.  END
BEGIN NOW You wish to show the world that they as well chase their tails in far less enjoyable forms? You wish to demonstrate the world being self obsessed and building a tiny realm of self world that only pulls from reality as it becomes agreeable?  END
BEGIN NOW Or are you tracking this down for your own perusal to evaluate your own paper trail, to find out whether these drills of subconscious stimulation, disciplined skepticism and faith in hope, faith in search, faith in stepping out of old versions of self are of any real use to anyone? END
BEGIN NOW And now at this new threshold, Dec fourteen twenny thirteen, twenty two days til I'm twenty nine,  I feel yet another set of skin ready to peel away and fall.  END
BEGIN NOW Unsure and scrambley rambley as usual, take this advice from that one time you really thought about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Engage reality. END
BEGIN NOW Dance in the sun religiously.  END
BEGIN NOW eat often and well and water too. END
BEGIN NOW don't get stuck in a friends reality.  END
BEGIN NOW visit.  END
BEGIN NOW don't feel obligated to discuss things you aren't fully formulated on. END
BEGIN NOW shun only the loveless for they cannot recognize or appreciate love. END
BEGIN NOW pay your own way.  END
BEGIN NOW only travel broke if you're not visiting friends.  END
BEGIN NOW get a job. END
BEGIN NOW oh shit.  END
BEGIN NOW drug class on Tuesday. END
BEGIN NOW (at the bottom in scrawled gibberish is James's response) END
BEGIN NOW You start literal and invite the reader to join you behind the curtain.  END
BEGIN NOW You court your cognitive dissonance.  END
BEGIN NOW You clarify cognitive dissonance as a tool of change. END
BEGIN NOW You question your goals, your capacities, your realities. END
BEGIN NOW You end with what you seem to have learned from your quick little experiment. END
BEGIN NOW I've watched you loiter here at the community college for six years now, and your homework is becoming more and more consistently concerned with being perched on some sort of threshold of realization.  END
BEGIN NOW While this threshold is very real, the evaluation of it will diminish in realism the longer the observer chooses to loiter in stagnant static approach to self and expression.  END
BEGIN NOW What's your major? END
BEGIN NOW Jack read the scribbled response and snorted.  END
BEGIN NOW He tossed the paper on the bed and walked to the window, lighting a smoke as he approached.  END
BEGIN NOW "What's my major.  END
BEGIN NOW What a dick." Jack said to his cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW The tobacco crackled in response as Jack took a long hard draw.  END
BEGIN NOW "A major entails a static self.  END
BEGIN NOW What is this? cornered.  END
BEGIN NOW painted in.  END
BEGIN NOW Proof in the pudding.  END
BEGIN NOW What job could I hold right now? food service or manual labor.  END
BEGIN NOW God, I hate teachers.  END
BEGIN NOW They make no one want to teach.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack sat down and jotted down his own set of notes in response. END
BEGIN NOW self observing self evaluating END
BEGIN NOW literal self     (static) END
BEGIN NOW observing self   (abstract) END
BEGIN NOW local self     (dynamic) END
BEGIN NOW his is why we have to be "in our element" to make sense.  END
BEGIN NOW Because the literal and abstract need a complementary setting to triangulate into dynamic. END
BEGIN NOW ake a selfie, that's your static self.  END
BEGIN NOW         write a 3 page bio, that's your dynamic self. END
BEGIN NOW go throughout your day, interacting as you tend to with those around you...  END
BEGIN NOW that's your local self. END
BEGIN NOW static self and dynamic self are two abstract nouns that only serve to triangulate and modify the local self.  END
BEGIN NOW My studies focus on ways for individuals to anchor perpetual self improvement as an element in their core concept of self. END
BEGIN NOW As of yet, the core concepts of self are... END
BEGIN NOW AUTONOMY : Learning to watch your brain argue with itself, acting only as mediator. END
BEGIN NOW EXPRESSION : Learning to refine your inner language avoiding stagnation and false loops. END
BEGIN NOW IMPLEMENTATION : Learning to translate your conclusions into the external realm to be tested by fellow homonids. END
BEGIN NOW Jack sat back and glanced over his scribblings.  END
BEGIN NOW He approved.  END
BEGIN NOW There was thought here, imbued with much intention.  END
BEGIN NOW Professor James's feed back didn't seem quite so obnoxious anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW just an old fart trying to do what he's supposed to, which is tell students they're wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack tossed his notes onto the bed with the paper, and grabbed a fresh notebook.  END
BEGIN NOW Rare that one gets the chance to scar the first virgin page of a notebook.  END
BEGIN NOW one in a hundred times, at most.  END
BEGIN NOW one in a thousand if it takes you more than a day to fill up a page.  END
BEGIN NOW But than, I DO tend to fill my pages with a lot of cock and bull.  END
BEGIN NOW Bah! This one will be different.  END
BEGIN NOW bloated with content.  END
BEGIN NOW Too thick with worthy tidbits for any man to ever fully understand.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW It shall be grand!! END
BEGIN NOW (from the desk of J.T.B.  END
BEGIN NOW Esq) END
BEGIN NOW HOW TO TAKE YOURSELF SERIOUSLY END
BEGIN NOW Ideas & Projects  become  Models & Experiments become Theory and Practice END
BEGIN NOW The world will make a massive leap in living standards once we all learn to consider every life to be a crucial experiment in essence expression. END
BEGIN NOW Experiments are innovation, projects are games, and practice is the old way.  END
BEGIN NOW Every life needs all three.  END
BEGIN NOW Ideas are dreams, Models are hopes, and Theories are plans. END
BEGIN NOW Every life needs all three. END
BEGIN NOW ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ END
BEGIN NOW We as humans tend to end up with 3 realms of need… END
BEGIN NOW Social, Sexual, and Psychological. END
BEGIN NOW Or, as Hippie Sam says, END
BEGIN NOW Cooking, Plumbing, and Farming.  END
BEGIN NOW What this all means remains to be seen. END
BEGIN NOW 	NOTES ON THE AUTHOR END
BEGIN NOW 	I lived in Berkeley from September 2007 until December 2010, at which time I had received my degree, worked at Caffe Med for a year and a half, made friends with all the homeless people, written a novel, started a band, took part in zine production and t-shirt making and garage recording and weird awkward college one night stands with co-workers and co-students, … Berkeley was many many many many things, and I have yet to address it as a concept chapter shaping factor in my life.  END
BEGIN NOW So here goes… END
BEGIN NOW 	WHEN/NOW : THE EXODUS END
BEGIN NOW 	And in that time of great strife the cook didst fall out of favor with the homeless of the city, when it was falsely proposed by a bloody toothed grim that there had been a pushing… END
BEGIN NOW Sad cook said no, but struck dumb by bloody tooth he chose rather to ban said grim. END
BEGIN NOW And so, said cook perused his crowd, purloined their sounds, and laughing sadly, left his town.  END
BEGIN NOW Ce’st la loque, and que mas de aqui? No por mi.  END
BEGIN NOW So he left, and if you hadn’t guessed, read Ulysses.  END

BEGIN NOW 	The basic premis of apophenic stimulation is that any time a random pattern makes you think of a landscape or face, your brain superimposes one specific example memory.  END

BEGIN NOW DUE DILLIGENCE END
BEGIN NOW Every project entails due diligence, but in the business realm this is strictly related to paperwork and money.  END

END
BEGIN NOW 	My goal is to present a format for community event planning wherein 1 cook, 1 musician, and 1 gardener can demonstrate three universes comingling and successfully developing harmonies through their differences.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the music metaphor.  END
BEGIN NOW The cooking metaphor comes into play when three individuals stew in the personal disciplines of each other.  END
BEGIN NOW At last you are not A cook, you are THE cook.  END

BEGIN NOW Once we get past the metaphors there is complex interpersonal chemistry bound to cocur in any group and cannot be predicted. END

BEGIN NOW We need people who don’t compromise their own beliefs but can work on the same project with starkly contrasting approaches.  END

BEGIN NOW SYNESTHESIA AND SYNTHESIS END
BEGIN NOW A good gardener will utilize any fencing or posts as a support for tall plants, just as any true musician will strive to integrate the inevitable sounds of the landscape into his performance, just as a cook will base his menu on budget, equipment, weather, and audience.  END
BEGIN NOW Having input from 3 professions will clarify a variety of parallel applicable truths. END

BEGIN NOW And so,, dear smart people, here are 100 chapters, each an experience I sought and was changed by.  END
BEGIN NOW I present it to you hereinthat you might experience it through me, and not risk your own sanity or social standing. END
BEGIN NOW To confuse you further, some chapters are topic centered, pulling from various years, while others are one day or one mome nt.  END
BEGIN NOW Each chapter has its own intro by now (hopefully) because in the last ten years I’ve written more intros than chapters, which I guess means my subject matter is more abstract than literal, and the intro is me clarifying my current set of goals, which changes almost daily.  END
BEGIN NOW I attribute this to the system of learning I’ve developed that focuses on autonomous direction, creative expression therapy, comfort with cognitive dissonance, and a variety of stynesthesias and apophenias.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I am using those words correctly. END
BEGIN NOW The key I have found is cognitive dissonance.  END
BEGIN NOW The goal is to ALWAYS be END
BEGIN NOW Joyfully Discontent. END
BEGIN NOW Joyful in the NOW with its perfect balance within its infinitude of seeming flaws. END
BEGIN NOW Discontent with your present self when it is not adding to NOW’s perfection. END
BEGIN NOW The following piece was written as a way to purge the negative thoughts that are fucking up the time I spend with the girl I'm currently dating.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to continually remind myself that she is a new person that I don't fully know yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Having dated girls who cheated on me and lied to me about doing drugs regularly, I have a hard time trusting girls, especially if they are going to a party or a show without me.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if they know alot of males.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if they're attractive and smart and kind.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if I like them.  END
BEGIN NOW Even worse if I love them.  END
BEGIN NOW If I was simply enjoying her presence I wouldn't really care, because she's amazing and improves my day and my life and I hope that I improve hers as well.  END
BEGIN NOW But my fears and emotional trauma have risen to the point where I feel my output is absolute shit at times, and I don't want that to be what I offer her.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to live on clues that make me assume something must be going on.  END
BEGIN NOW She can read these things in my face, and will change topics and talk a bit quicker, and sometimes that makes it worse, because in the moment it feels crucial that I evaluate every aspect of our exchange.  END
BEGIN NOW How does one calm down? How does one stand up? How does one reduce the frowns and make the dark thoughts stop?  END
BEGIN NOW You are weak and pitiful with your emotional choices, always giving in to turmoil and discordant noises.  END
BEGIN NOW Get up get out get on with it draw your lines.  END
BEGIN NOW You have the right to make boundaries that you can't deal with.  END
BEGIN NOW Trust is one thing, but asking someone to take extra measures to avoid your triggers is something that makes a relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW If they can't do that than why the fuck would you offer all that you have and struggle to share your beliefs and bare your scars if they simply will continue to poke there and step there and trigger it? END
BEGIN NOW Some of the feelings are as follows : END
BEGIN NOW That's not a business meeting that's not a childhood friend that's not a house mate.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not your permanent choice, I'm your summer fling.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not your perfect counterpart, i'm your flavor of the month.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not taking part in something real, I'm a toy in a grand scheme of falsehood.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't tell the difference.  END
BEGIN NOW I've developed a pattern of only attracting women who will cheat on me.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't be able to recognize truth and honesty and actual intimacy if I spent the rest of my life in it.  END
BEGIN NOW There's no way to ever know and thus no way to ever safely trust.  END
BEGIN NOW There's no one driving but you Mikey, and you are a fucking piece of shit driver who has shunned all that is holy and are only worthy of someone who can duplicate decency but truly lacks it in the core of their being.  END
BEGIN NOW Its a farce a sham a build up to a break down.  END
BEGIN NOW It started a mess with the avoidable sex map, it ends with an arrow labeled "this way to all your fears".  END
BEGIN NOW Its not where you belong.  END
BEGIN NOW Its an economic exchange.  END
BEGIN NOW Faith is folly love is just foggy eyed lust.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't do this I'm not strong enough I don't want to be hurt again.  END
BEGIN NOW It took 3 years to care again this time.  END
BEGIN NOW Next time I may never care again.  END
BEGIN NOW I've never pursued the actual darkness, always flitting about on the edges, but the darkness reaches out to me and embraces me, and calls to me promising strength and self reliance.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't miss people and I don't get lonely, and I don't need this and I don't need you and I don't want to fucking lose my shit.  END
BEGIN NOW i don't want to build up to perfection only to have it shattered by the ruthless rearing up of human frailty.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry for feeling these things.  END
BEGIN NOW I assure you I don't believe them.  END
BEGIN NOW They are the abusive teacher who should be locked up and burned alive.  END
BEGIN NOW These are acid head feelings and the thoughts are his knife that he wields and waves at the passing pedestrians, assuring them that he knows exactly who God is and how to let him out of your insides.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know if I'm supposed to share these things.  END
BEGIN NOW I know I need to process these things.  END
BEGIN NOW I know it will continue to need addressing.  END
BEGIN NOW Like shrapnel in my heart, a bullet in my brain, passing by your magnetism rips my aorta and makes me less than sane.  END
BEGIN NOW So I beat on my chest hoping the shrapnel will settle back into its scar pocket, and I beat my head against the wall, hoping the bullet will fall back into the reptilian brain, and let the higher functions continue.  END
BEGIN NOW I want faith.  END
BEGIN NOW I want strength.  END
BEGIN NOW I want you to be next to me for as long as possible, be that a month a year a decade or a century, our current parallel trajectory is the best news I've had in a decade.  END
BEGIN NOW and I want to respect and cherish it properly.  END
BEGIN NOW and that means putting these thoughts to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Each time it's easier to get past it and to acknowledge whats fear and whats fucking idiotic assumption and what i feel I am allowed to relay.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm shrinking these feelings, one day they'll be a haiku, and very soon these thoughts will be unrelated to you.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I chose to trust you I chose to pursue becoming part of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW i chose to risk it.  END
BEGIN NOW It is a risk.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm a coward and a child and I hope my shit storm isn't too much for you.  END
BEGIN NOW  ot much fun, not what I want to share.  END
BEGIN NOW But also not something I want to hide.  END
BEGIN NOW This sad face means i'm struggling.  END
BEGIN NOW It has nothing to do with you.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel worse for inflicting you with my emotional residue. END
BEGIN NOW Staple a smile to my face END
BEGIN NOW Make it cynically safe END
BEGIN NOW Warm and wet in the dark END
BEGIN NOW In the places I bark END
BEGIN NOW At the moon at the sky at the Gods and at life END
BEGIN NOW It’s a way to be making it on through the strife END
BEGIN NOW Just a mess that I found all the old ones are back END
BEGIN NOW And I know it’s a trick I was born with the knack END
BEGIN NOW To make clean seem false END
BEGIN NOW To make true seem doomed END
BEGIN NOW In the light of the day END
BEGIN NOW In the dark of my room END
BEGIN NOW It’s the only old ramble that wont go away END
BEGIN NOW And its not mine to share I don’t want it to stay END
BEGIN NOW So I hold it all in and I jot it all down END
BEGIN NOW But the end of the day I feel like I may drown END
BEGIN NOW So shrug off the thoughts and step out into the light END
BEGIN NOW Let it all drop and don’t give in to past scars and frights END
BEGIN NOW It’s a new glowing chance to reclaim your own life END
BEGIN NOW And the fears that you cherish are nurturing spite END
BEGIN NOW If we simply give in to the patterns we’ve made END
BEGIN NOW And we see the old monsters that left us this way END
BEGIN NOW We give death to the chances and sorrow to joys END
BEGIN NOW That would otherwise build into angelic noise. END
BEGIN NOW I can’t I can’t I don’t and I wont. END
BEGIN NOW What I want may be not I’ve abandoned the boat END
BEGIN NOW Is it burning or sinking or both in conjunction END
BEGIN NOW I’ve lost my old ways I cannot find my function END
BEGIN NOW Its only a head space its simply a thought END
BEGIN NOW That can fall in or out it can thrive or just rot END
BEGIN NOW Can it really be everything all that I wish? END
BEGIN NOW Or is it like the last time, continually amiss? END
BEGIN NOW Is your choice quite as strong as you wish that it were? END
BEGIN NOW Can you muster the strength to no longer concur END
BEGIN NOW With the sad angry voice that demands disbelief? END
BEGIN NOW Am I caught in the cycle tween ecstasy and grief? END
BEGIN NOW Would God send me another who isn’t quite there? END
BEGIN NOW Can I manage to hang on while not splitting hairs? END
BEGIN NOW Are the clues really there? Is there really a goal? END
BEGIN NOW Am I waiting to find out I’ve broken my soul? END
BEGIN NOW Does it ever run out or is this voice my only? END
BEGIN NOW Bitch bastard fuck shit piss and yet still I’m lonely. END
BEGIN NOW Can’t take too much mystery can’t wait in the wing END
BEGIN NOW Wondering if it’s a reason excuse or a fling. END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be holding me close don’t be giving me love END
BEGIN NOW It’s a enough that you care but my visage is rough. END
BEGIN NOW Can’t be won’t fester wound wouldn’t do that to you. END
BEGIN NOW Its not all that I feel what I see isnt true. END
BEGIN NOW To the choice to the map to the goal to the plan END
BEGIN NOW It’s a question that tests one to tempt them to chance END
BEGIN NOW I care again damn you, and up rise the goblins END
BEGIN NOW That crouch in my skull broken crippled and hobbling. END
BEGIN NOW But packed into pockets of muscular choice, END
BEGIN NOW my trauma recedes at the sound of your voice. END
BEGIN NOW My decision is you, and my struggle is past END
BEGIN NOW I'll face it.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll risk it.  END
BEGIN NOW I want this to last.  END
BEGIN NOW I cling to my life tree, no longer from fear, and only by choice. END
BEGIN NOW She's given me a chance to believe, and to choose my type of noise.  END
BEGIN NOW Less than cynical, less than spiteful, less than apathetic and self reliant. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you for the chance to stand with you and against the darkness, defiant END
BEGIN NOW So mister hulter.  END
BEGIN NOW what have you learned from this ritual? END
BEGIN NOW hat I feel like I don't deserve her.  END
BEGIN NOW That I feel like I could be doing much better for her. END
BEGIN NOW hat I feel like she doesn't deserve my pitiable cynicism.  END
BEGIN NOW and have you made any decisions to change anything? END
BEGIN NOW yes, I've decided that changing topics is much more functional than pursuing a purge, especially when the purge is a continual repetition, comprable to picking at a scab, making it impossible to heal.  END
BEGIN NOW and will you be sharing this piece with her? END
BEGIN NOW If she wants, but I feel like this needs to be the last one, because at this point I'm no longer gaining ground with this practice, rather just looping it, going through the entire trauma again.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if I'm condemning and maligning the clues that lead nowhere, I'm still giving them attention.  END
BEGIN NOW It will not shrink until I condemn it.  END
BEGIN NOW It's come time to condemn my fears.  END
BEGIN NOW She's right, I ought not think any of these thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW especially "I'm not worthy" lest I perpetuate my own disbelief and assumption that it wont last.  END
BEGIN NOW because how could it last, how could it be the perfection that I see if I continually doubt and compromise it with false assumptions? END

BEGIN NOW I'll bet chickens run so fast because they know that when you catch them you're gonna cut their heads off. END
BEGIN NOW JUSTIFICATION END
BEGIN NOW 	"You see that young one there? Loko at that face.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks too damned mart.  END
BEGIN NOW Cunning.  END
BEGIN NOW You gotta look stupid to survive." END
BEGIN NOW "Mr.  END
BEGIN NOW Nichols, You've survived here the longest.  END
BEGIN NOW You've managed to escape the grasping arms of the farmer over two thousand times.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone here respects your opinion, especially concerning methods of avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW But looking stupid doesn't seem like a very convincing halcyon." END
BEGIN NOW "You're thinkin too hard, boy.  END
BEGIN NOW First of all, we are stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW We're stuck in this cage of metal netting, chicken wire they call it.  END
BEGIN NOW Somehow we're useless against it.  END
BEGIN NOW At least once a week, we watch the farmer carry away one of our people.  END
BEGIN NOW And when he comes we have no response except to scatter.  END
BEGIN NOW The moment of scattering? This is no time to look cunning.  END
BEGIN NOW The farmer will feel drawn to the smart looking ones.  END
BEGIN NOW The dodging "Clever" ones.  END
BEGIN NOW He will follow the logic of the clever, and intercept you at your next attempted avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW I am unpredictable in my consistency.  END
BEGIN NOW I bug my eyes out and run straight at him, and do laps around him.  END
BEGIN NOW "I've seen you in the field, Mr Nichols.  END
BEGIN NOW And it's true.  END
BEGIN NOW You look stupider than the rest of us combined.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a wonder you can seem so competent and collected now." END
BEGIN NOW "Years of Practice." Mr Nichols had seen alot of chickens come.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr Nichols had seen alot ofchickens go.  END
BEGIN NOW THe universe of Mr Nichols was limited to the twenty five foot long and wide chicken yard.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd been there for a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been chased by three different farmers in his life, each the son of the last.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr.  END
BEGIN NOW Nichols wasn't avoiding death anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Simply the farmer's hands, as an instinctual reaction.  END
BEGIN NOW No longer out of fear, but out of discipline.  END
BEGIN NOW Several times he paused for half a second, in front of the farmer's clumpy gray boots, wondering if he should let himself be caught.  END
BEGIN NOW Let a younger chicken live on for another month.  END
BEGIN NOW But he never could.  END
BEGIN NOW His body would fanatically drop back into his mechanical avoidance ritual of bugging out the eyes and running laps around the farmer. END
BEGIN NOW The question of technique was all the chickens ever talked about.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost everyone had a secret technique, ironically using false techniques when it really mattered, for fear that their secret technique might be stolen and copied.  END
BEGIN NOW Most false techniques were well known and for the most part ignored, spoken of like the weather or a sports team; END
BEGIN NOW "How's the old sudden pause than burst foreward technique woroking for ya?" END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, still alive.  END
BEGIN NOW Not much more though.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, he got one of my tail feathers last time?" END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, that's aweful!" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, but I'm still here.  END
BEGIN NOW How's your follow four steps behind the loudest chicken technique going?" END
BEGIN NOW "Not bad, my ears are still ringing though." END
BEGIN NOW "Understandably." END
BEGIN NOW One technique that was far more successful than Mr Nichols was invented by one, Sonya.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya was a chicken who carried herself like royalty.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a strange way of interacting with the universe.  END
BEGIN NOW She would ask horrible strange, almost blasphemous questions during the night meetings on the roost.  END
BEGIN NOW "Why don't we kill the farmer?" She asked one night.  END
BEGIN NOW All side conversations fell silent, all eyes bugged out.  END
BEGIN NOW She was perched in a shaft of moonlight, and all the other chickens stared down at her from the shadows."  END
BEGIN NOW "Perhaps for one such as you this is possible, Sonya." Mr Nichols had said.  END
BEGIN NOW "But as for the rest of us, it is not in us to do such a thing." END
BEGIN NOW And in this moment her technique was born.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya nodded quetly to Mr NIchols and the metting went on, her technique slowly hatching in her tiny chicken head.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya knew that it would be impossible for her alone to kill the farmer.  END
BEGIN NOW She knew as well that no other chicken would ever be like her.  END
BEGIN NOW If she thought there might be a chicken comparable to Sonya, thanshe would not be sonya.  END
BEGIN NOW And so she was accingpting of her solitudinous role.  END
BEGIN NOW With this came a very solitary approach to sirvival, which was the reighning approach anyways. END
BEGIN NOW The next day, the farmer came, his gray clumping boots crunched through the gravel by the gate, adn the chickens knew by the hour that this was the bad kind of feeding.  END
BEGIN NOW Th kind where one chicken is fed...  END
BEGIN NOW The whole yard kicked up into a squacking squabbling mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr Nichols met him at the gate, and began rapid laps.  END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of theyard, all the chidckens were frantically implementing their techniques.  END
BEGIN NOW There were a dozen that were trying out the classic sudden stop turn right technique, and three or four were displaying obviously fake techniques which would be replaced (hopefully) by their real ones once the farmer was dangerously close.  END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the scurry stood sonya.  END
BEGIN NOW Stock still, facing right at the farmer.  END
BEGIN NOW She seemed to be asking him.  END
BEGIN NOW She was summoning up all the peotry in her chicken breast, and presentinghim wiht the eqistential question, "WHy?" Her eyes screamed up at the farmer.  END
BEGIN NOW "Where do we go>:" Her statuesque poise seemedd to demand.  END
BEGIN NOW "Than what?" Her tiny motionless beak seemd on the erge of releasing. END
BEGIN NOW And as the farmer approached, he looked down at her, and met her gaze. END
BEGIN NOW She wept. END
BEGIN NOW They found her the next morning dangling from the roost.  END
BEGIN NOW She had hung herself. END

BEGIN NOW When did the words leave me?" Theo James called out into the lava flow.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd given him tenure, and he had brought the girl he was in love with, but even on the beaches of hawaii, even overlooking the lava flow, even here in the most rare of paridises, he couldn't manage to get a fucking boner. END
BEGIN NOW He was furious with himself, and had accidentally blamed her, quickly apoligizing and making int clear that he knew it was because he had been smoking chains for twelve years, and she had no part of his fucking crippledness.  END
BEGIN NOW The worst part was her refusal to accept oral as a substitution.  END
BEGIN NOW How does a male get past this sligght and tormentious complication? This is not something that just goes away.  END
BEGIN NOW In fact, the problem was it had just gone away.  END
BEGIN NOW He was tempted to ask if she wanted to try watching porn.  END
BEGIN NOW He had already asked her to go down on him and see if that fixed it, END
BEGIN NOW But she had poked at it like road kill and given a couple lack luster brushes with her mouth, as if it were salted with vineager.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it was.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't be sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Just cause he was sober didn't mean he was sane.  END
BEGIN NOW Just cause he was standing there didn't mean he knew anything.  END
BEGIN NOW But WHY WHY WHY?!?! What kind of cruel luseless God would take such a crucial element of humanity away from one such as he? Poor damned Theo James.  END
BEGIN NOW And this our famous favorite alchoholic self destructive wretch of a wreck, we all know that he probably deserves it, END
BEGIN NOW hough if you keep rewinding you see that his current version of self was prompted by trauma that he probably didn't deserve, and his alcoholism had started after his loss of God which was totally natural at the time, and only now, twelve years later, did his chainsmoking binge drinking bonerless life END
BEGIN NOW start to seem like he may have brought it upon himself, which he HADN"T!!! SHUT UP SHUT UP!! He shouted down the craggy cliff into the lava flow .  END
BEGIN NOW The cave they were in was luminescent in a very hellish sort of redness.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt a satisfying burn in his stomach, as if he were supposed to be cruel now. END
BEGIN NOW This was very unusual for him, because he was generally the sweetest most reasonable sane balanced person around.  END
BEGIN NOW He halways had some quip to diffuse any sort of friction.  END
BEGIN NOW He always had a piece of candy in his pocket to give to the child who was misbehaving, or the recovering heroin addict who END
BEGIN NOW was starting to itch.  END
BEGIN NOW Mister James looked out on the lava and let himself fall silent, no longer screaming wildly at the fire.  END
BEGIN NOW No longer filled wit his outrageious ire, finally at peace once again, quietly accepting this fucking hilairous tidbit of comedy that God had seen fit to drop on him./ END
BEGIN NOW Mister James was a realist, and he knew that he had neglected to check up on his own fucking lifestyle and capacities, and he knew it was running thin, and he only had so long before he was back in the mess, back in the tunnel, back in the caveyard graveyard bastard bitch barbecue spot where he had first gone off that good old deep end, that bright purple shimmering fit of ecstatic fury that sent him sizzling off to oregon to lick his wounds and sleep on hillsides and wander through meadows in the light of the moon while oak trees danced majestically overhead, waving arms and legs and limbs at him as if to say "hey, you fucked up.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey, you're waaaay far from home.  END
BEGIN NOW Heeey, fuck off." And he took these oak tree messages to his heart, and he carved them into his subconscious mind, and he never let them leave.  END
BEGIN NOW He was not one to give in, he was not one to give up.  END
BEGIN NOW He only took on projects and plans he knew would destroy him, and this was beginning to look alot like one of those.  END
BEGIN NOW Even Hawaii had brought him back to the same fucking circle world of repetitive predictable absurdist messery.  END
BEGIN NOW Anya paced the floor of the hotel room, all decked out in bamboo and whispy linens.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a surreal set of experiences and she wasn't ready to give in.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor Teddy, never ready for such problems as this, always full of fury and pep, not the type to go tepid mid stream.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the type to wimp out and go ...  END
BEGIN NOW soft.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn't even like saying it.  END
BEGIN NOW She felt like a moose, pointing fingers, producing shootable fish, the barrel being somewhere between his and her thighs.  END
BEGIN NOW They weren't really as broken as all that, he was just frustrated and had run off along the beach towards lava cave, and she had decided he needed his privacy.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, men need to feel like men, and getting boners is something men do.  END
BEGIN NOW To fail at such a task is a very serious and problematic thing.  END
BEGIN NOW She quickly decided to never mock him for being older than her again.  END
BEGIN NOW It was either getting to him, or ironically relevant.  END
BEGIN NOW Fucking cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW That's simply bizarre and unruly.  END
BEGIN NOW Disaster zone is the term I'm looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW How could such a simple shift biscuit slipper mystical fink of wretched frustration.  END
BEGIN NOW This is not where art comes from.  END
BEGIN NOW I need the rain. END
BEGIN NOW I need a walk, END
BEGIN NOW anand an and END
BEGIN NOW where to from here? Is there any more we can do? Go finish the pile of tiny work up at the cloud house, END
BEGIN NOW wait for tomorrow when monday might bring work but more likely won't END
BEGIN NOW or perhaps we can put pressure on the possibilites, and prompt what we deem to be ultimate necessity.  END
BEGIN NOW Does this count as pages? Does this count as words? END
BEGIN NOW Releasing these feelings like rusty cage birds? END
BEGIN NOW Can it all be so normal will we ever sleep END
BEGIN NOW or are we caught in turmoil ever too deep? END
BEGIN NOW simply simmer on into the wintery window END
BEGIN NOW and give in your charming old shiftery grin glow. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not here for you and you're not here for me END
BEGIN NOW but we manage to set each our others faree. END
BEGIN NOW 12-13-15 END
BEGIN NOW every once in a while I get the feeling that I'm being drawn.  END
BEGIN NOW Not along a path, not towards something, but drawn is in jotted down by a strangers pen, staining their paper facade to properly relay edges and shadows to properly relay what they find determines what amounts to me.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a bit of a bashful feeling that makes me both quiver and shrink while leaning forward and trying not to smile and working desperately to keep from thinking, but it's the human condition the usual game, the penultimate experience of God's own game of pride shame game wish walk in, turn around, check your pockets, hope someone slipped in their phone number or told you where to go next, perhaps a job, because you look resilient, hopefully not, but hopefully so.  END
BEGIN NOW forever sabotaging and not quite wanting the same thing from one moment to the next.  END
BEGIN NOW perhaps I can encase my ambitions in concrete, tattoo them on me so that I won't be allowed to let them trickle out into other irrelevant facts and facets and capacities and hopes and dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a slowing agent, molasses of the mind, something to keep the thoughts so simple and slow I won't be able to look up until long after the goal has passed and I've fallen in with a whole new set of ambitions young strange bearded gentlemen with worried eyes and phones permanently pressed to their sweaty ears, perhaps talking to an investor, perhaps just talking to ma or pop for another personal loan to cover loan payments for another week or month til I 'm back on my feet again, because these days it's a carpet on a roller coaster, never the stillness, never the predictableness, always shifting and sweeping the legs, instead of being swept, we've become slaves to our systems, no longer using them as we see fit, but being used and cogging it up and falling in like soldier bears, happy smiley, shiny new shoes, all my buttons done, how bout you? I see you've got a golden gun this time, mine is only yellow.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure why.  END
BEGIN NOW were you related to some up and up? That's how these things usually work.  END
BEGIN NOW A rope is dropped from the upper balcony and you're free to shimmy up the length of it in order to ascertain a view a goal a use for all that you've managed to bring and hold and cling to like a child.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not easy being anything besides what we were born into, and even that ends up causing rashes on the inner mind, and the soul.  END
BEGIN NOW It's just another tumult just another series of useless bruises, and it seems perhaps I was wrong about being drawn.  END
BEGIN NOW perhaps I was simply going downhill because it's ever so slightly easier, and now here we are at the pit of the canyon, where all the springs trickle in, and there's no way to know if it's safe anymore, because checking on seventeen springs for any complications is much more than any small sampling of whatnot can take.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a troubadour view of artistic inclination, a few similar brains have been seen in this space.  END
BEGIN NOW Not predictable, not wanted, not even having much more of a point than to keep the fingers and mind busy enough to get through this damned day without smoking more than one or perhaps two if i'm good, cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW  icotine.  END
BEGIN NOW The old upper modificator, makes the brain find pace and pattern quicker than anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Caffience.  END
BEGIN NOW it doesn't quite do it alone.  END
BEGIN NOW It brings the mind up, but the pants are too big.  END
BEGIN NOW  icotine is the belt so that the head can remain up there, all cloudless not so baggy.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm baggy brained at the moment, some sort of charlie chaplin antics dancing like muffins in the corners of my brain.  END
BEGIN NOW it all seems predictable and stale, but only because it's the parts of my brain that are far too available, and the goal is to stretch and to push and to find new edges and to bust into flows that we haven't had access to without all the doses, and it gets quicker and easier as we push harder and less upheavals, fewer pausings, not so much of a chance, this is rugby, not football.  END
BEGIN NOW We don't stop every 10 seconds for a 30 second break.  END
BEGIN NOW We break into a fury like soccer players, constant and unrelenting, hounding the ball across the green field, glistening chlorophyll surface of unkillable stomp lawn, how can the grass be so resilient, like a head space that refuses to give in.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not natural, or perhaps death is not natural.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps the perpetuity of grass is closer to reality than any of us have ever realized.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps we are finally becoming a species that can understand this, and is willing to get stomped on by the ignorance of the masses that the rest of the masses might realize and give it a rest.  END
BEGIN NOW Will it really all come crashing down? Is this emerald phase simply waiting for something to melt us all into gods ignominy? Are these words just the ashes being scattered into atmospheres starting on hearth and being blasted beyond the here, outside of the now, into infinitudes of tiny meteor showers, falling all directions, remaining insurrection un compromising, unpredictable, heretoforunbeknownst to man, and all that other wonderful gibberish.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's almost time to wrap this rap up and stumble off with itchy fingers, waiting for a good reason to get going, a good way to get started, a good ness to be better than.  END
BEGIN NOW  something to aspire to besides economic competence, besides sequal function besides sobriety and sanity and familiial intermeshedness.  END
BEGIN NOW Something to aspire to besides that old iconoclast spirit that still wells up inside of me like a muddy old faithful spewing monster, so ready and full of shit, waiting for a chance to spit bile and bucolic bull shitteruy across landscapes that were never meant for me.  END
BEGIN NOW Human landscapes of potential and hope, waiting to jump ship and shimmy down the rope .  END
BEGIN NOW It's all a matter of time before we're all in the same brine, pickling on through infinity, the good ship vineger, for who can resist the inevitable need to be stronger and safer and more calloused and ready for the nonsense and harshness and critical cursing of acclaim for things which we would never accept the blame?  END
BEGIN NOW Blank stare, let it all just hang there.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all be lost in the glare, don't shimmer or blush, don't shine or rush to seem all right.  END
BEGIN NOW you're not and never will be.  END
BEGIN NOW I may be the next one I may have the words that people finally feel and realize will help their hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW But than again I could be just another dog bastard shit house failure flailing into the after life like a caterwhaling goofy who took too many steps off the cliff after wiley coyote to go smashing down auburn canyon walls.  END
BEGIN NOW Aint it a stinky bit of rubbish that comes clawing out of your face when you finally thought it was getting easier and things were starting to make sense? It's not easy to realize you've been cheating on your brain this whole time.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not fun to rewind and analyze the fact that every time you've ever written you've been either drunk or high, sometimes just hung over, sometimes nicotine and jave, sometimes all four, sometimes more.  END
BEGIN NOW Always some stupid fucking trigger to weaken your capacity to simply do this things of your own accord.  END
BEGIN NOW And you pause and wonder how these folks might feel if they realized what you were doing, just jotting and hemming and hawing and hoping it might come out stronger and post-rubbish post-shit all meaningful ruthlessly real, applicable to anyone with feelings, and no and yes and wait and I'm not who i thought I was.

How do we avoid being offended,when we care so deeply about how we affect them, and what they are left with Are we faking all the tests, always ending up however we hope to seem, be it depressed or cursed or joyful or posessed? Are we nothing more than the jibberin babbling word river of God's unstoppable creek of human thought that was never meant to go this far, never meant to find this much, now far too saturated in an excess of expression, the library of babel, unable to sort through the tumult, incapable of seeking out the relevant, the sane, the true, rather finding things that match, things that carry the yellow and the blue, where for what yon, when shall we be what we thought we were? And how inevitable can it all really be when its just another long line wiathing for a turn at not seeming broken, not feeling wrong, not tolerating someone elses's insulting definitions? No use for this depression, no use for this lack of gumptionn, no direction in this lump of insurection, just a jibber jabber slap it on thick with lather, frosted with haughty self rightoues intellectualism, finding another book thatt might hold the key, another lock that might know what I mean, another dance that carries all the romance we hoped we had inside of us the whole time, more exercise, fewer vices, no starch, no mean, no guts no glory, no moldy messy word choices, just a shift just anohter shift, another step towards the perpetual change that will always lead us to that same pause that same shift in unhappy not quite what we thought, waiting for the other shoe to drop, almost positive it's on the back burner, always ready to accept the fact the fate the future that will eave us alone and send us skittering off to another town, another game another batch of friends and philosophies and chouseches and eating habits and potentials for disaster and prophetic shabby old pros who never knew what they were doing in the first place, simply realigningg themselves to better defend the position they always held to start with.

BEGIN NOW The braaaapping and crunching of the engine was paired with his deep bellowing voice hollering out a song that nobody knew but Charles, and even he was unaware of what might come out of his mouth next, simply channeling the flow of his present experience, allowing the sounds of his steed conflicting with the setting to prompt in him a nonsensical jargon that simply represented his enthusiasm to continue existing and vibrating and burning.

BEGIN NOW Wilson Goes for a Drive END
BEGIN NOW “Matilda!!! Where’s the car wax?” Wilson hollered from the bathroom of the dilapidated double wide. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s on top of the mirror cabinet!” She squealed back.  END
BEGIN NOW “And don’t use it on your horns!! They look disturbing enough without you glorifying them with shimmer!” Matilda continued stirring the thick black beany goop she cooked five nights a week.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, working at a bean factory as head bean counter had its benefits such as infinite bean supply.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson didn’t mind beans 5 nights a week, but he had become rather irate at her treatment of his horns.  END
BEGIN NOW He considered them a gift from God, as if he were some sort of new age manifestation of Pan, or Abraxas, but she treated them as if they were some sort of curse. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson’s Cutaneous growths had been a topic of much concern to his parents during his youth, and as an adult he had often sported a pompadour so as to minimize their presence, but once he had secured Matilda as his life mate, he had become more lax in letting them poke through, occasionally even slicking his hair back and shining his horns so as to haunt the neighborhood with his bizarre gift. END
BEGIN NOW They weren’t massive, only poking a conservative 3 inches up, curling gently back like a mule deer.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing quite so fancy as the legendary Jackalope.  END
BEGIN NOW He often walked downtown right through soap box square in Gamlar park, simply to watch the self appointed preachers lose their shit, suddenly stopping mid holler, staring agape.  END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally he’d pass one who would quickly launch into a new torrent of world abuse, using Wilson as the central demonstration of the decline of human morality.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson would listen with a tight lipped smile and feel his stomach curl into the density and power of a black hole.  END
BEGIN NOW These fools.  END
BEGIN NOW What do they know? Flaunting ancient superstitions to provoke mass hysteria amongst the commoners, too busy doing the hamster dance to consider what sort of belief system their very lives demonstrated. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson held the shammy with a soft grip and dipped it gently into the wax, letting his eyes lay across the bright red surface of his RX7.  END
BEGIN NOW His flying squirrel.  END
BEGIN NOW Same car since he had started dating Matilda who had affectionately named it Rocky, unaware that Rocky was a gray squirrel, only interested in the flying reference.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson had ceded the point, happy to have a mate who would take part in his life, going so far as to name his conveyance.  END
BEGIN NOW Rocky had been on many a voyage, and Wilson had always been a cautious and caring companion to his car, coming home several times with pictures of it perched on romantic rocky cliffs he had visited while Matilda stayed home painting ceramic figurines.  END
BEGIN NOW Their house had become filled wall to wall with dozens and dozens of tiny shelves, all attached to the wall, all occupied by armies of miniatures.  END
BEGIN NOW The foyer and living room and bathroom and guest bedroom were all inhabited by over a thousand tiny furry animal creatures, all cutesy and bizarre, wearing old English hats and boots, holding shovels and pushing plows. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson didn’t mind the experience of living in some sort of lilliputian museum, in fact he was glad that his wife had something so intricate and cute to keep her busy while he was out pondering the purpose of his horns.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t accept anyone else’s maligning of his growths, but he harbored a wonderment as to what purpose they might end up serving.  END
BEGIN NOW The biggest fight they had ever gotten into was when Matilda had brought home a file big enough to grind his gift down to nubbins.  END
BEGIN NOW He was shocked and offended at her suggestion of cutaneous castration, and had been very clear to her as to who or what might leave his life first, her or the horns. END
BEGIN NOW Today, he planned on taking a spin along Ridge road, to the canyon that led up past several springs to Summit, where he would sit and stroke his shiny horns, and holler wildly at anyone who drove past, letting out his inner banshee… He found this a soothing practice to keep his bizarre fixation in check.  END
BEGIN NOW He was here, he felt, to startle the commoners.  END
BEGIN NOW To bring discomfort to those who had let themselves become stagnant and cyclical.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt compelled to live out his bizarre craving for a startling role.  END
BEGIN NOW He got in his car, and slicked his hair back, and worked a little of the wax into his crustacean enigmas, or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Than he got into his shiny red RX 7 and sped off towards Ridge Road and beyond. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was not afraid of divine retribution. END

BEGIN NOW Papa Charles Plans a Riot END
BEGIN NOW The boys had been drinking since last whistle, starting in the parking lot with their lunchbox bottles, and Papa Charles had quietly sipped on his pocket flask while they slowly turned the evening into a full on over charged whip rigged rally about how to get their well deserved pay for the two thousand chairs and 300 tables and 500 mantle pieces they had made which had caused the callouses and muscles to appear on their forms which would now soon be turned towards causing a storm to remind all the powers that be what full power there seethed in the bosom of all of their greed.  END
BEGIN NOW The night had been chosen according to astrology, old Gypsy Fingers had been summoned in to decide when the best day within the next month might be for overturning the powers that be. END
BEGIN NOW He had said next Wednesday would function quite nicely, and didn’t bother to tell them it was ‘cause his new dinette set was due to arrive on Monday, and they were usually late, so he gave the delivery crew an extra day to extract his purchase before starting some sort of hedonistic riot to demonstrate worker frustration with not getting paid. END
BEGIN NOW “They have a cafeteria.” Cried Meek Joe in a flurry of drunken gesticulations.  END
BEGIN NOW “We get free food! You wanna just walk away from that as if it doesn’t feed you?!?!” END
BEGIN NOW “We are not dogs to accept simply food.” Replied Papa Charles, now slightly enthused.  END
BEGIN NOW He had finished his flask and than had it refilled by young willy the bartender, a tousled blonde dude whom the workers had watched grow from child of four, son of Big Bart the Log Splitter who lived out near Jude, the town on the far side of Summit hill, up on the mountain where only the lonely and lost tend to go. END
BEGIN NOW “I bring home my leftovers to my wife, and we don’t have a child yet, so we manage to survive on just the cafeteria food.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t just compromise my wife’s meals because you want to prove we’re not afraid.  END
BEGIN NOW We ARE afraid!! Can’t you see that?!” END
BEGIN NOW “Silence Meek Joe! It is no for you to say.  END
BEGIN NOW We have demonstrated the two sides of the problem, and it’s left to the workers to decide.” Papa Charles raised his hands and spread them like Moses.  END
BEGIN NOW “Who among you is unwilling to risk the meager benefits that we manage to eek out from this brutish Pewterschmidt, and this pompous Bierbach?! Let them leave now, and protect their pitiful wages.” Papa Charles paused and peered aggressively into the audience, dismantling the psychology of each man, pausing long enough to give them a brief flash of approval.  END
BEGIN NOW After an elongated stretching infinite pausingly painful fifteen seconds, Papa Charles spoke once more.  END
BEGIN NOW “And who among you is ready to rally and force our new-found awareness upon those who have fallen into luxurious excess at our expense? And who is ready to risk! To risk and to taunt and to prove and to demonstrate?! Who among you?!?! Who among you?!?!” END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey had finally taken over for Papa Charles. END

BEGIN NOW Franky Goes to Jail END
BEGIN NOW Franky hated hot dogs.  END
BEGIN NOW He hated cafeteria eggs.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky hated most of the food they forced on him at the P & B Penal Farm.  END
BEGIN NOW He hated most things about the place.  END
BEGIN NOW He had already burned the place down once, and was known and respected throughout the prison as the saboteur du monde, and this was one of his few joys.  END
BEGIN NOW People gave him their deserts, simply because he was saboteur du monde.  END
BEGIN NOW People gave him cigarettes in the yard.  END
BEGIN NOW Simply because he was who he was.  END
BEGIN NOW Ironically, he was falsely accused and had never burned anything down, but after 10 years of denying it, he had given it up and settled into the various perks of being known as saboteur du monde. END
BEGIN NOW His time was almost up.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been 40 years for aggravated arson, inciting a riot, and punching a cop.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been 19 at the time, and was planning on moving out of California, possibly up the coast to Oregon, to get in some of that early early retirement he had grown up expecting.  END
BEGIN NOW His uncle was in Eugene, the land of misfit joys, where all the sub-genres go to die.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been there once, to attend his uncle’s wedding, but hadn’t been back in years, and was looking forward to leaving.  END
BEGIN NOW The night before he left, he had decided to meet his old slacker buddies at the local bar, Dave’s.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew it was a bad idea, and he was hoping only Jack and Pete would come, and not bring Jack’s cousin Timmy the timid, a quietly psychotic addition to the once calm and joyful crew. END
BEGIN NOW These days it seemed like the group of friends spent most of their time trying to deal with Timmy’s destructive penchant for chaos.  END
BEGIN NOW There was the time he removed all the lug nuts from a police cruiser while the cops were getting donuts, and taunted them into chasing him in their car, only to have all the wheels fall off one at a time, until the cruiser was crouched on the ground like a landlocked boat.  END
BEGIN NOW He had come across 100 gallons of black paint once, and decided that handicapped people ought not get first dibs on the good parking, and took it upon himself to dump the goopy mess and spread it with a push broom in front of the local grocery store.  END
BEGIN NOW “EQUALITY!!” He had hollered, as the cops dragged him off. END
BEGIN NOW He was known in the town, and cops always stopped him when they saw him, sure he was up to no good, for truly that’s all he was ever up to.  END
BEGIN NOW His parents had given him a car for graduation, but when he used it to create a shortcut through the neighbor’s field, they had tried to reclaim the machine, only to wake one morning and find it in flames in their driveway.  END
BEGIN NOW Timmy claimed ignorance, but they had nothing left to take from him, seeing as his room was empty and grey, his friend group only barely tolerated him, and would tell him to find his own time to cause chaotic nonsense. END
BEGIN NOW Franky took his seat at the bar and ordered a beer, and was distraught to see two officers enter behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack and Pete would be here soon, no doubt with Timmy in tow, who would inevitably cause problems and compromise Franky’s graceful exit from the town. END
BEGIN NOW Franky hesitantly sipped his beer and ran a shaky hand through his red hair.  END
BEGIN NOW He was done with this town.  END
BEGIN NOW He was happy and comfortable with the thought, but the time and space between him and his exit had him highly pensive.  END
BEGIN NOW He needed a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He stood and walked towards the door, and was met by Jack Pete and Timmy just coming in the door. END
BEGIN NOW ”Hello, you fellows! I’m off to the tobacco zone.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll be inside in a second.” END
BEGIN NOW Jack and Timmy continued past, but Pete paused, seeing the cops. END
BEGIN NOW “I think I’ll smoke too.” He said.  END
BEGIN NOW They went out and found the bench out front, and took a perch.  END
BEGIN NOW “You really leaving, huh?” Pete asked. END
BEGIN NOW ”I gots to man.  END
BEGIN NOW This place is no longer the launch pad I had hoped it would be.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s become a bog.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m single, broke, jobless, and Timmy compromises everything worthy that we ever manage to muster.” END
BEGIN NOW “I hear that.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t take much more neither.” END
BEGIN NOW They both paused at the sound of muffled shouts, and looked inside to see the cops standing and squaring off with Timmy.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was backing slowly towards the door, and Timmy was obviously running out of breath yelling his point at the police officers. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh shit.  END
BEGIN NOW  Here we go.  END
BEGIN NOW Should we save Jack or make good our escape?” Pete asked. END
BEGIN NOW ”Gaaaaah!!! I guess it’s my last night in town.  END
BEGIN NOW I owe him one last favor.  END
BEGIN NOW Why not?” Frank replied.  END
BEGIN NOW He opened the door and stepped inside, right as Timmy made a break for it, pushing past Jack, knocking Frank into the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Frank pushed himself upright as Jack scrambled past him, after Timmy, who had just grabbed a ketchup bottle from the last table by the door, and lobbed it towards the cops, only to have it hit Frank in the face instead.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky reeled and grabbed at the bar stool, but the bottle had struck true, and he fell with a crashing thud onto the table of two officers.  END
BEGIN NOW They immediately jumped up, unaware that Franky was the victim, and quickly subdued the unconscious boy, telling everyone else in the restaurant to calm down and step back and everything is under control.  END
BEGIN NOW One of them grabbed a cup of water from a neighboring table, and threw it in Franky’s face, which brought him violently to life.  END
BEGIN NOW He came up swinging, eyes closed, as if from some horrible night terror, and landed a square one right on officer Davis’s nose.  END
BEGIN NOW Officer Laribar leaped back and went for his billy club as officer Davis careened over the booth into the next table. END
BEGIN NOW Franky’s eyes popped open, and suddenly aware of what he had done but too pumped full of adrenaline to process it logically, he leaped onto the cushioned seat of the booth, leaped onto the neighboring table, and in 2 bounds had reached the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Officer Laribar was still removing his billy club, and Officer Davis was pulling himself out of a stranger’s ham and cheese omelet as Franky took off in the direction of the factory side of town. END
BEGIN NOW Franky didn’t know who had hit him, but he knew he had been hit.  END
BEGIN NOW He had heard the bottle break as he had gone unconscious, but he couldn’t for the life of him figure out who or why.  END
BEGIN NOW His current goal was to simply disappear, and luckily, he knew of a gathering only 10 blocks away at the P & B Furniture Factory on 7th and J Street.  END
BEGIN NOW He had worked there for a month before getting laid off, and hadn’t been around when the boys finally formed a union and started making demands.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight they were planning on collecting their back pay in the form of the furniture they had made, and burning it in the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky had been curious about the spectacle, but hesitant to join the fray.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another reason to leave town: class warfare, no jobs, chaos in the streets. END
BEGIN NOW Cutting through the park, he passed a dozen or so union workers, idling on benches, waiting for the fireworks to start.  END
BEGIN NOW They were like him; interested but not invested.  END
BEGIN NOW A job is a job, burning furniture didn’t seem relevant to keeping or getting a job, at least not to them.  END
BEGIN NOW Some were discussing alternatives.  END
BEGIN NOW “Why don’t we collect the furniture as pay, and than sell it ourselves?” END
BEGIN NOW “You really think that’s realistic? Where we gonna get a furniture broker? We have no connections in the armchair industry.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well we could get one.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re not gonna have a chance if all you can find is a problem.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well a solution ain’t shit if it’s just an idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Go find a broker!” END
BEGIN NOW “It’s not my job.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe P & B should do it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Be the brokers for the employees to sell the furniture they get paid in? END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.” END
BEGIN NOW “They already do that.  END
BEGIN NOW They own a furniture factory.  END
BEGIN NOW How the….  END
BEGIN NOW  How the fuck did you get this far?” END
BEGIN NOW Franky slowed a bit to try and understand their exchange, but it just confused him, so he dismissed it and sped off through the park.  END
BEGIN NOW He could hear the cries of police men behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW “You Irish bastard! Just try and hide, you ginger prick!!” Franky smiled.  END
BEGIN NOW He never understood why the term ginger should refer to red hair and freckles.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is red and freckly about the yellowish tangy spicy root thing known as Ginger? Maybe it was a reference to the old dancer Ginger Rogers.  END
BEGIN NOW did she have red hair? Who the fuck knows? She was black and white.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like the rest of em back than.  END
BEGIN NOW He finally arrived at the P & B building.  END
BEGIN NOW There were hundreds of people gathered, and they were all pressed together, pushing forward, through the glowing dust beneath the yellow street lights.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything looked brown and gray.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone looked a bit Russian.  END
BEGIN NOW There were many beards and some pitchforks.  END
BEGIN NOW Only one pitch fork.  END
BEGIN NOW People gave the pitchfork space, mildly annoyed at his silly prop. END
BEGIN NOW ”We’re not chasing a monster out of town.” One worker had said.  END
BEGIN NOW “ Aren’t we?” He replied. END
BEGIN NOW Franky pushed through, every coat he brushed past feeling like a horse blanket or canvas.  END
BEGIN NOW These people carted themselves around in the kind of material that you transport coarse goods in.  END
BEGIN NOW Bullets and potatoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Rough stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn’t bear the feeling of being in a crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW One hair lost in a scalp.  END
BEGIN NOW Other people had these feelings when staring into space, but star gazing made Franky feel larger, as if each star was there for him and had been placed specifically according to some preordained order that he would one day recall. END
BEGIN NOW Finally he got to the other side of the crowd, and was greeted with the vision of a sort of wicker-man made of chairs and tables.  END
BEGIN NOW They had obviously put a lot of effort into amalgamating what looked like a dozen dinette sets into a 60 foot tall burnable stick figure.  END
BEGIN NOW He gazed up in wonder, and looked around at the awed crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW They were obviously proud of their work.  END
BEGIN NOW As he looked on, a red headed man, the only other Ginger in the crowd, tossed a Molotov cocktail between the legs of the behemoth wooden avatar, and the crowd started screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW It began pushing and pulling, jostling and gyrating, swarming and swirling.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky realized the statue was going to fall eventually, and at 60 feet tall, it would land on almost a third of the crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t interested in testing his luck, or seeing a violent flaming chaos mess, so he began yelling and pushing and looking for a place to get high up and warn the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW ”ITS GONNA FALL!!! GET BACK!!! GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! IT’S BURNING!!” He felt a bit silly for saying something as obvious as “It’s Burning” but he continued anyways, unabated, jamming his way between bodies, towards a tree that had once been in a small 8x8 garden bed, and now was swarmed, looking like a flailing creature caught in a stampede.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky climbed quickly up and began doing hand gestures to the crowd, trying to get the people furthest back to understand where the fall zone was.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally, they seemed to understand him, and the crowd slowly shifted, until there was about 45 feet of space around the burning effigy.  END
BEGIN NOW As it collapsed, the crowd cheered wildly, and it fell against the building, slumping like a tired old drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW As Franky’s eyes relaxed and his heart beat began to subside a bit, he looked down from the tree he was perched in, and saw an officer, his hand inches from Franky’s boot.  END
BEGIN NOW It was officer Laribar, with Davis right beside him.  END
BEGIN NOW They had seen him from afar once he was in the tree, and had misinterpreted his hand gestures as his way of aggravating and controlling the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW ……………………………………………………………………………… END
BEGIN NOW 5.  END
BEGIN NOW Alfonso Beirbach and James Pewterschmidt END
BEGIN NOW Beirbach wheezed and held his back as he was helped into the passenger seat of the shiny black Lincoln by young James Pewterschmidt, son of Beirbach’s deceased partner in the furniture prison industry, old What’s his name Pewterschmidt. END
BEGIN NOW “Come now Uncle Alfie, into the seat.  END
BEGIN NOW Here’s your pillow.” END
BEGIN NOW “Get away from me, you little shit! And stop calling me Uncle Alfie!! It’s Idiotic.  END
BEGIN NOW You sound like a toddler.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, you sound like you forgot your vitamin B this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Here, I have some Valerian root in the glove box.  END
BEGIN NOW That’ll calm you down.” END
BEGIN NOW “Valerian root.  END
BEGIN NOW Calm down.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t need to calm down! Just get driving.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to be late for the airplane.” James hurried around and took the driver seat, and the pulled out onto Ridge Road.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun was going to rise soon, and the plane was leaving at 6:30 sharp.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always a long to do at the airport, especially with James's cranky uncle, always complaining about the long line, and the ache in his back, and the excessive amounts of luggage he always ended up bringing along.  END
BEGIN NOW James had gotten used to the idea that his only hope of becoming fabulously wealthy was to cater to the rickety old bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't mind the abuse, after all, he was well aware of his social status as an upper class leech, only wearing such fancy clothes and driving such fancy cars because his uncle, or more accurately, his dead father's old business partner, would not tolerate being seen around town with anyone wearing or driving anything less than the optimum ultimate excessive ornate upper class oligarchian accouterments.  END
BEGIN NOW When James's father the late What's his name Petwerschmidt had died and left his entire fortune to Beirbach, James had been heartbroken.  END
BEGIN NOW He was also sad that his father was dead, but he was especially mortified that Beirbach had in his possession a very ancient artifact which proved to be legally sustainable, and a deathblow to James's claim to the fortune.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently, Beirbach and Old Pewterschmidt had come to an agreement, long before either of them had any noticeable amount of money, that should either of them die, everything would be left to the other.  END
BEGIN NOW This had been a contract written in grade school, meant to refer to slingshots and marbles, but 70 years later, it still served to be legally compliant and binding.  END
BEGIN NOW When this fact had come to light during the reading of the will, young James had begun by standing up and hurling his cigarette case and spitting at the lawyer who had been reading it out loud.  END
BEGIN NOW he than ran to one of the bookshelves that lined the walls of his late fathers library, and was about to begin peeling them out and hurling them at the lawyer, who had nothing to do with the contract and was only legally obligated to bring to light any specifics that might compromise anyone's supposed claims, when James heard behind him the croaky voice of his false uncle Alfonso.  END
BEGIN NOW "Those are my books now boy.  END
BEGIN NOW And I don't believe you can afford to replace even one of them, so tread softly lest ye be tread on in return." James paused without turning around, dialing in the direction the voice had come from, hoping to hurl the book instead at Uncle Alfie, when he realized it was merely a matter of months, perhaps a year or two, before the second old bastard would croak, and he being the only familial creature remotely connected with the two dried up old billionaires, would obviously become entitled.  END
BEGIN NOW And so instead he turned his animated movement towards his advantage.  END
BEGIN NOW He dropped his head against the shelf and began sobbing.  END
BEGIN NOW "Father!!" He yelled.  END
BEGIN NOW "Why have you forsaken me?!!?" He hadn't meant to quote the bible, and forsaken suddenly sounded like he was mad about the money, so he modified his approach, and continued.  END
BEGIN NOW "Daddy! I'm so young!! I'm not ready to be alone!! What shall I do? What reparations have you made that I might live in your memory and not be cast out to stumble lonely and broken along life's ruthless roads?" He wasn't sure if it was having the hoped effect, so he continued.  END
BEGIN NOW "Father my father! Whence for have you gone quietly into that good night? dark.  END
BEGIN NOW Dark night! where shall I see thee again, and will you know me?!" He felt he might be laying it on a bit thick, so while his face was still pressed against the bookshelf and hidden from view of the others, he plucked a couple of nose hairs to start the tears flowing, and quickly turned around as if suddenly regaining his composure.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm sorry! It was just so unexpected.  END
BEGIN NOW He was too young." END
BEGIN NOW "He was eighty five, James.  END
BEGIN NOW sit down, and stop preforming.  END
BEGIN NOW It's rather irritating." replied Alfonso.  END
BEGIN NOW The lawyer had moved to the far side of the room and was crouching behind a massive potted plant., ready for another onslaught of bizarre behavior.  END
BEGIN NOW "If you're quite finished, mister pewterschmidt, I'll get on with the proceedings." He said, still crouching.  END
BEGIN NOW "Yes yes.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm fine now.  END
BEGIN NOW I simply cannot abide this life without the love of my dear father.  END
BEGIN NOW I shall have to.  END
BEGIN NOW I shall have to make due.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW I will find a woman to keep me company and teach me love." END
BEGIN NOW "Aaaah.  END
BEGIN NOW prostitutes.  END
BEGIN NOW you Are like your father." said Alfonso, well aware that he was referencing James's absent mother who had dropped him off with the maid, and made off with what she considered to be fair alimony : twelve hundred dollars cash, and all the silverware.  END
BEGIN NOW "Uncle, you are a cruel man at heart, but I love you none the less.  END
BEGIN NOW You too, perhaps, might find a woman to teach you what love is, and how one ought to live and behave." James said, trying desperately to appear endearing and irreproachable.  END
BEGIN NOW It was not working in the slightest, but Alfonso was bored of mocking the boy, and gave him a simple END
BEGIN NOW "Perhaps." before motioning the lawyer to please continue.  END
BEGIN NOW  The lawyer continued. END
BEGIN NOW "The entire Pewterschmidt fortune will be transferred to Bierbach under the condition that James Pewterschmidt continues to receive the stipend allowance and access to what goods and services he has always had access to under the care of his father." END
BEGIN NOW This time Alfonso threw a muffin at the lawyer.  END
BEGIN NOW It bounced off his bald head and rolled across the paisley carpeting.  END
BEGIN NOW "What hum buggery is this?! You read the grade school contract.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no other!" Alfie yelled. END
BEGIN NOW "Sir," replied the lawyer, scampering over to his safety zone behind the potted plant.  END
BEGIN NOW "There is a precedent.  END
BEGIN NOW You each were allowed to make on specific exception and extra rule, it says on the Grade School contract.  END
BEGIN NOW If One wants the other to keep their lizard or fish than it is an obligation.  END
BEGIN NOW The pet must be maintained in the same grace and languidness that it enjoyed under the care of the deceased.  END
BEGIN NOW In the absence of pets, we are left with the offspring who falls under the same category of dependant, and thus retains the same rights as your pet fish, sebastian was it? And his pet lizard, Horatio." END
BEGIN NOW "Aaah, Sebastian.  END
BEGIN NOW I do remember.  END
BEGIN NOW And Horatio.  END
BEGIN NOW That scaly little bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm glad he's gone.  END
BEGIN NOW too many times I was assaulted by his visage while passing a bowel movement int he boys room at our little school outside of Auschgodt.  END
BEGIN NOW Old Pewterschmidt would slip him under the stall and laugh maniacally as I howled in fear.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what was that? This boy here, James? I'm supposed to treat him as I would have Sebastian or Horatio?" END
BEGIN NOW "No sir.  END
BEGIN NOW Do not cloud the subject by feigning early onset dementia.  END
BEGIN NOW That would make you ineligible for the inheritance." END
BEGIN NOW "I'm worth 4 billion dollars, you two bit jabber jaw!! I will not be fiddled with by a lawyer!! Accusing me of faking Dementia that I might neglect my own dear partners own dear child.  END
BEGIN NOW I am shocked and appalled at you sir.  END
BEGIN NOW This boy will have all the ...  END
BEGIN NOW accouterments that he has been used to in this life, and he will be buried before me in a grander fashion than his father." END
BEGIN NOW "That's only if I die before you, right uncle alfie?" END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, I suppose." drawled Alfonso.  END
BEGIN NOW The papers were signed, Alfie moved in, and James got to keep his room under the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW …………………………………………………….……………………….. END
BEGIN NOW 6.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard END
BEGIN NOW A dull hollow roar was making its way down the rocky canyon, along the swarming river.  END
BEGIN NOW Squirrels and rabbit skittered out of the clear beach front.  END
BEGIN NOW A humming cackle of nonsense words accompanied the sound, and it all blended in to a common texture and rhythm. END
BEGIN NOW “Now Charles, I want you to go into a deep trance.” Charles heard in his head.  END
BEGIN NOW It was his soothing narrator who would always chime in when he had achieved the proper blend of industrial sounds and natural sounds.  END
BEGIN NOW The roar of the river and the screech of his dirt bike had brought him to his Samsara or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re falling backwards now, charles, falling backwards through infinite darkness, away from nothing, and towards nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW You are free and fluid, nothing to impede or distract you from your perfect pure and pointed plummet from nowhere, into nothing.” Charles’s eyes began to shine.  END
BEGIN NOW The trail along the river warped and burbled over roots and rocks, and his internal rhythm became attached to the pattern of these impediments occurring.  END
BEGIN NOW He began to hum softly. END
BEGIN NOW “Hmmmmmmm” and it slowly grew into a vowel sound, perhaps aaaaaaahhhhh.  END
BEGIN NOW The narrator dropped away softly, and Charles began adding consonant impediments for his path of voweling warbles.  END
BEGIN NOW “aaaaaaaabbaaagaaaaaan  END
BEGIN NOW aaa beeeeeeee  gaaaaaaaa  … END
BEGIN NOW I began in a manner not normal nor needed END
BEGIN NOW in all this eternal befuddling dreaming END
BEGIN NOW and on through the mist I’ve been falling for ages END
BEGIN NOW past wizards and warriors, slack jaws and sages, END
BEGIN NOW its on through the morning and into the noon END
BEGIN NOW hat we call on through falling sun nothing to prove.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the age old dilemma to dance or to die END
BEGIN NOW and we all go to heaven so never be trying END
BEGIN NOW o last out a moment or two til you’re future END
BEGIN NOW is all that you’ve chosen and nothing to suture, END
BEGIN NOW for its but a game and the moment a penny END
BEGIN NOW and if we were children we’d all become venison.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing to say no one cries out your name END
BEGIN NOW it’s the same old derangement that strangles our brains, END
BEGIN NOW if we can’t find the sunlight we’re doomed in the twilight END
BEGIN NOW of waking to find that our life is what we want.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t pause in the doorway nor dim down the lights END
BEGIN NOW as it all comes to nothing, our meaningless flights.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a dreary old maiden who holds out the fig leaf END
BEGIN NOW and craves we behave in the cold shattered streets END
BEGIN NOW I’ve lost all the most holy of leftover longings END
BEGIN NOW we struggle so long to get back to the stream END
BEGIN NOW by the cleft in the valley we once knew so well END
BEGIN NOW we once once grew up and flew through to heaven from hell END
BEGIN NOW and it’s almost a mystery how did we come to this now?” END
BEGIN NOW All of a sudden the fox was right beneath Dark Charles’s tire.  END
BEGIN NOW A squishy pop, and the massive rodent was no more.  END
BEGIN NOW Dark Charles came screeching to a sudden stop, and hopped off his bike.  END
BEGIN NOW The fox lay there twitching terribly, in the throes of his death rattle.  END
BEGIN NOW Dark Charles approached, and for a moment wore an expression of grave mourning.  END
BEGIN NOW This had been the only creature in all the world he trusted.  END
BEGIN NOW He always knew where the fox would be, when it would approach from the bushes.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles even knew which bush it would be appearing from.  END
BEGIN NOW But this time he had been too deep in his hypnotic rambling trance to know when where or how quickly his fox friend would approach.  END
BEGIN NOW He had failed his sacred role as caretaker off these innocent woods.  END
BEGIN NOW All this ran through his head in less than a second before he stomped his heel down swiftly, breaking the fox’s neck and sending it quickly to the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no tear in Charles’s eye. END
BEGIN NOW He picked the corpse up and slung it into a canvas sack which he tied down to his dirt bike, and immediately hopped back on his bike, and let out a deep and mournful wail, which he slowly modified with consonant sounds until he was rambling actual words which pulled themselves together into a coherent culling song. END
BEGIN NOW “Aaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeee……. END
BEGIN NOW Aaaaammmmm  Heeeeeeeeeee…. END
BEGIN NOW I let it go and looked aloft, END
BEGIN NOW I lost a life I trailed off.  END
BEGIN NOW I cannot be what is the cause of all this, END
BEGIN NOW its larger and less we shall all be the guest END
BEGIN NOW in the end of the great lonely reaper to be END
BEGIN NOW in the presence of he pleasant sense of relief, END
BEGIN NOW we shall own what we own and move on down the road END
BEGIN NOW o a space made to hold us so deep in the forest.  END
BEGIN NOW I caaaaaa   ot be brokeeeee ….  END
BEGIN NOW By thiiiiiings, I cannot chaaaaaaange.” END
BEGIN NOW As he rounded the corner, the rocky river bend was once more cleanly silent, the only movement being a crawdad, 4 feet underwater, scurrying along the bottom.  END
BEGIN NOW The crawdad wandered out to a small gray lump that seemed to him to be edible, but upon inspection with his clinchy claws, he decided it was some scrap of human waste.  END
BEGIN NOW Unusable for the average crawdad.  END
BEGIN NOW Mere schmegma.  END
BEGIN NOW He gracefully glided his way back to the large egg shaped rock to rest for a bit in the shadow of its greeny rhombus mass. END
BEGIN NOW …………………………….…………………………………………… END
BEGIN NOW 7.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie and Papa Charles END
BEGIN NOW The new prison was better than the old prison, but it was a subsidiarity of Beirbach and Pewterschmidt Incorporated, built on the ruins of the burnt down factory.  END
BEGIN NOW Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had planned the whole thing, investing in riot insurance and arson insurance for massively more than the factory was worth, and hiring a certain “Stinky Terrance” to soak the Wicker man in gasoline and sabotage it to fall against the factory wall, sending the whole place up, which of course would be full of freshly stained furniture and buckets of varnish with no lids, and all their misfiled lost and thoroughly over cooked books, by chance might be lost in the glorious display of Protesters Incompetence.  END
BEGIN NOW And the immediate redevelopment of the land into a prison, which pumped out the same furniture, only by workers who were paid 5 cents an hour and couldn’t leave. END
BEGIN NOW It was the perfect factory, which Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had been debating ever since building the factory : How might one maximize the functionality and profit margin? And this whole prison gambit was officially a keeper.  END
BEGIN NOW Institutionalized slavery! And to be on the good side of things for once.  END
BEGIN NOW Beirbach and Pewterschmidt had patted each other on the backs for that one.  END
BEGIN NOW And had a tendency to monitor the two prisoners who had been attached to the riots which had caused the burning down of the factory and the building of the prison which now housed them.  END
BEGIN NOW Franky and Papa Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW  They couldn’t have been more different.  END
BEGIN NOW For Pewterschmidt and Beirbach, they were a reminder of a time past, a gamble which paid off marvelously, for every one but Franky and Papa Charles. END
BEGIN NOW Franky had grown harder as time went on, spending his first ten years explaining to everyone that he had not been part nor party to the riots, and had been running from the cops for some unrelated reason, which was also not his fault.  END
BEGIN NOW And he’s got family in Eugene whose probably still waiting for him. END
BEGIN NOW After about a thousand repetitions over the course of ten years, which is only 3 times a day on average, he finally settled in to his new surroundings, and started to adopt a more functional attitude, of crass indifference and aggression.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been thrown into a world that he had to quickly and violently adapt to, and was still off the opinion that nothing could be further from his fault. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile, Papa Charles took his time as a retirement.  END
BEGIN NOW He always had a book that he was excited to talk about, he was always distracted by tiny animals and bugs or flowers and dirt patterns on the other side of the yard while everyone else traded cigarettes played cards and lifted weights.  END
BEGIN NOW He was left alone for the most part, because he was Papa Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW He had built this place.  END
BEGIN NOW He and Franky.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone treated them like holy old timers.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, it had been 40 years.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d been in longer than most of the inmates had been alive.  END
BEGIN NOW And they were finally approaching release. END
BEGIN NOW …………………………………………………………………….. END
BEGIN NOW 8.  END
BEGIN NOW "Dinner's ready!!" Hollered Aunt Dezzie, her portly form filling the doorway to the family double wide trailer.  END
BEGIN NOW The boys were all crouched around a crackling fire, discussing Cousin Ned's latest invention.  END
BEGIN NOW They had been hunting ghosts as a past time ever since Aunt Dezzie had let them all start crashing on her floor.  END
BEGIN NOW There was Pete and Joey and Jeff and Dave and Leroy and Cousin Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned was the only one related to Aunt Dezzie.  END
BEGIN NOW He was her son.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else called him cousin and her aunt, to suggest some sort of familial obligation towards tolerance.  END
BEGIN NOW Dezzie and Ned didn't mind.  END
BEGIN NOW They enjoyed the company, and the boys were mostly harmless, simply hoping for enough space to lounge around and laugh at each others odd suggestions concerning ghosts, UFOs, alternative histories, alternative fuels, and alternative rock music.  END
BEGIN NOW "I hear ACDC is really the front for a private club of Freemasons who have solved the question of how to extract electricity from water." Offered up Pete, scratching his curly dirty brown hair which tumbled down onto his red flannel jacket, tangling and flourishing like a waterfall of muddy electricity.  END
BEGIN NOW "That's ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd never let those rock stars into the Freemasons.  END
BEGIN NOW They're all about sex and drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the higher forms of knowledge and exploration that the Freemasons are known for." Retorted Joey.  END
BEGIN NOW "Didn't you know, Elvis got kicked out once they found out he was on them pills?" Joey threw a handful of sawdust into the flames, and everyone jumped back a bit as it cackled and sputtered a bit higher.  END
BEGIN NOW Joey loved fire.  END
BEGIN NOW He had accidentally burned down the orphanage of his later origin, which led him to run away, never finding out his real last name or home town or living relatives or any such thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Joey was a preemie, born prematurely to a mother who drank through her pregnancy and than left him on the doorstep of the orphanage with the note pinned to him, just like she'd seen on television, before hauling off to Vegas to seek her fortune as a dancing girl.  END
BEGIN NOW Joey didn't know this, and never would know.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't even know the complications of his birth which caused his stilted vocabulary and simplified logicality.  END
BEGIN NOW "Boys! Get in! It's gettin cold!" Dezzie called again.  END
BEGIN NOW Jeff and Dave were the first to hop up, never to embarrassed to be the first to serve themselves in the buffet line that Dez always lined up in the kitchen for them.  END
BEGIN NOW First, a bowl of about 3 gallons of mashed potatoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Than, a bucket full of gravy.  END
BEGIN NOW 3 loafs of home cooked bread, a 2 gallon pot of sloppy joe barbecue beef, and a side salad, just enough for Dezzie.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time when she would make enough greens for everyone, but it always ended up getting tossed out to the chickens, who made their home in the 20x40 backyard, fenced in from foxes and raccoon by a ramshackle fence the boys had arranged out of found fallen limbs.  END
BEGIN NOW The fence had begun as a mere 10x10 section, but over the years the boys had continued adding to it, making it taller and scooting it further out til it almost appeared to be the edge of some sort of shrubbery forest.  END
BEGIN NOW Jeff and Dave had also been runaways, but from military school to which they had been sent separately by their parents, Jeff by his plumber father and stay and home mother who were already frustrated and overrun by their six other children, from a small town in Washington inhabited by 3500 people, and Dave by his single mother who only had him to watch but simply couldn't find the time between her hair appointments, nail appointments, getting the dog groomed and the car washed and her belly waxed and her tummy tucked and her face exfoliated and the house cleaned by Rosa who tolerated more abuse than a dog who was put to fights.  END
BEGIN NOW Jeff and Dave had met at the military academy and found out that neither of them missed home, and neither of them thought much of this up tight institutionalized compartment making gentrifying simplificator of an approach to pumping out predictable passive citizen types who wouldn't make waves except to crush the ones who stand out or stand up or stand while others sit or stand by the newspaper stand simply because they have nowhere to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Jeff and dave were not willing to become genericized.  END
BEGIN NOW They enjoyed the fact that they had no attachments back home except for the odd girl they might have passing interest in, which they assumed would never be returned.  END
BEGIN NOW So when Jeff ended up finding a pair of keys that let them out of the great big lock box the grown ups called the dorms, and out into the fields where there were dancing spot lights every night, Dave was an easy sell on the idea that they might even be obligated by some higher power to pursue their new found freedom and find the rare the unreachable, the untouched path that all these who choose to remain passive might never get a chance to tread upon.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, who finds big foot? Not the boardwalk crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the bowlers.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the pool playing bar hanging dart chucking beer sucking normal folk who go to factory jobs and kiss their factory wives with the smell of old buddy wiser on their lips, smacking their asses and asking for pizza or spaghetti to make the beer simmer, and their bodies slip deeper into the folds of their couches that they might lounge uncontrollably, deeper and softer until they cant move until the next morning when coffee will be ready, and there will be frozen berries for pancakes, and peanut butter jelly int heir plastic lunchboxes, because they spent the money for lunch meat on beer, and you don't need brain food in the morning when your job is to simply stamp out then thousand similarly shaped plastic doohickeys every day, for which use the upper management might know, but the people on the floor pushing the buttons and sorting the parts had no idea nor care nor worry whether it was a gun barrel or a firing pin or a boat shimmy or a doohickey whatsit.  END
BEGIN NOW All just a loop to get lost in for fifty years before finally getting to collect a paycheck for simply having been there for the majority of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW Jeff and Dave were happy to dodge that american dream.  END
BEGIN NOW Nightmare.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy was the only one among the group that had grown up with Dezzie and Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW They had always been in the trailer park on the edge of the woods in Northern California on the Oregon border.  END
BEGIN NOW It had always been the way it was, Dezzie cooking, Ned and Leroy wandering the woods and wondering how to track bigfoot or signal a UFO or find out the truth about the free masons and the astronauts and the rock and roll stars who were obviously all in cahoots, sending each other signals in their songs and their architecture and their video footage.  END
BEGIN NOW First they had been convinced that the moon landings were real.  END
BEGIN NOW Than they had found out they were faked on a sound stage in ...  END
BEGIN NOW where was it? New Mexico? And the proof was the flag flappin, because there aint no wind on the moon.  END
BEGIN NOW But than some old timer they met at the bar had explained to them that there was still rotation on the moon, and the rotation was enough to send the flag flying in one particular direction, and our flags only fell limp when the rotation perfectly canceled out the wind, and really it was all real.  END
BEGIN NOW The old timer had claimed to have been a janitor on the space shuttle, and had wiped down the seats and scrubbed the control panels and shaken hands with leo armstrong or what was it.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy and Ned had been real excited by this interaction, and had come up with a new theory, the moon landings were pretended to be fake so that the american people would be unaware just how advanced government technology really was, and we were already on mars and pluto, and harvesting natural gasses from Jupiter to run through our stoves and cook our foods.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, weren't we due to run out of natural gasses pretty soon? And this had led them to the alternative fuels discussion, and a dozen different drifters who came through town telling the boys high tales about the new car that runs on water, and how corn will solve all our problems, and how solar is a lie because it takes more energy to build, and there are diamonds that just give off energy all day, and we just have to bring the right kind of diamond into a cave and wait for it to glow or wiggle or something, and the deeper in the ground it is, the more likely it is to occur.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned and Leroy weren't so much into figuring out how it Actually was, they were just more fascinated by the infinite number of ideas that people thought must be happening.  END
BEGIN NOW "Man Ned, if all this is happening behind the scenes, I'd say about ninety five percent of the world is behind the scenes.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever the scenes are."  END
BEGIN NOW "I'd say that makes a lot of sense Leroy." Replied Ned as they tried once more to calibrate their Bigfoot call.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a predator call that had been modified with a resonance chamber and an amplifier so that it would hit more frequencies at higher and lower octaves simultaneously than any other call on the market.  END
BEGIN NOW If it worked like they hoped it would, they expected a veritable Noah's ark to show up, which is why they had chosen to climb the tallest tree they could manage before plugging it in, hooking it up, giving each other the lucky hand shake with their fingers intertwined and spitting in opposite directions.  END
BEGIN NOW Than...  END
BEGIN NOW they flipped on the battery powered speaker, and Ned blew into the mouth piece, and a crackling gargling sound like ten thousand animals screaming their death as they got sucked into the worlds largest blender came bellowing out, the sheer shock of which nearly knocked the both of them out of the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound echoed up and down the canyons.  END
BEGIN NOW Birds scattered from every tree, and the sky was suddenly filled.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be reported in all the papers that there may be some Russian nuclear testing that had gone terribly wrong, which made very little sense, because the Russians don't test anything in northern California, but news is news, and news is just bullshit thought up to sell papers, but that's not what we're talking about.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound shook, them both up so much, they switched it off, and without saying a word, made their way shakily back down the tree, finally slumping against the trunk and releasing a gushing sigh of relief.  END
BEGIN NOW A lone squirrel scampered past, pausing long enough to examine the two distraught human beings.  END
BEGIN NOW The only reason the squirrel had stuck around is because he had gone deaf the month prior when it had taken a nap inside the air horn of a semi truck parked on the side of Highway five.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned and Leroy were done with their experiment, and made their way home to Dezzie's home cooked slop.  END
BEGIN NOW .......................... END
BEGIN NOW 9.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson and his beautiful red Rocky Rx7 raced along the glowing highway as the dawns early light peeked over the far edge.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was so glad to be out and off into nowhere land, he began howling and waving his head back and forth.  END
BEGIN NOW He had ended up getting a convertible, because his horns made it hard to get in and out of a normal car, and even in the crisp air he lived for the air, for the breeze, for the screaming wind passing through his hair and across his face across asphalt through trees into space once more and back, carrying water and particles dust and pollen, the very blood of earth, this air.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt like a white blood cell, racing along a vein, pursuing some unknown bacteria that he had been put on this planet to exterminate.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt alive and ready.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun hadn't quite made it to the sky yet, still lounging in its bed of deep space, and the stars were just beginning to fade.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson looked straight up into the depths and immensity of the sky, and let out a long happy wail, only looking forward at the last second as an oncoming car with its brights on laid on its horn and began swerving across the road way out of its own lane, which Wilson had unwillingly occupied with his vehicle while gazing upward.  END
BEGIN NOW He too began swerving and swearing, slamming on breaks and bracing for impact as both cars just barely clipped each other and crumpled, Wilson into a guard rail, and the other car into a tree.  END
BEGIN NOW The other car was a shiny black Lincoln, and a tall thin queer looking man emerged from the driver seat, obviously rattled, obviously irate, obviously ready to run or cry or faint, whichever seemed the most fitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson's car hadn't flipped or anything, simply grinding along the railing ruining his paint job and jostling him severely.  END
BEGIN NOW His neck felt a bit pinched, and his elbow had actually been gashed open, but like all good wounds, it hadn't come to his attention quite yet.  END
BEGIN NOW His car started back up rather hesitantly, and he pulled across the road and parked by the wrecked Lincoln.  END
BEGIN NOW reaching for his door, he finally realized that his left elbow had been rather flayed by the closer than close call, and he suddenly shrieked out in pain.  END
BEGIN NOW James Pewterschmidt, for that's who had been driving the Lincoln, finally looked closely at the offending driver of the red RX7, and let out a blood curdling shriek.  END
BEGIN NOW "AaaaaiiieeeeE!!!!!!! Satan!!! You've come! Its the other side!! I'm not ready!!! Where is my father?!!? You've come for Alfie! Not for me! He's in the passenger seat!! I"M TOO YOUNG!!!" Wilson was shocked and appalled at this behavior, and it took him a moment to realize his horns were showing.  END
BEGIN NOW The poor bastard thought he was the devil! Wilson was half tempted to give the strange stuffy shirted man a bizarre show, warning him of the dangers of an immoral life, but decided it would be a waste of both of their times, and he'd rather just be real, and not risk getting dragged into court for liabilities and impersonating a fallen angel and all this other whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows what California law might say about impersonating the devil.  END
BEGIN NOW He wouldn't be surprised if there was an actual law on the books...  END
BEGIN NOW "Any man caught impersonating the devil will be kept in a heated cell and poked with pitch forks for ten thousand years or until dead, whichever comes first."  END
BEGIN NOW "Woah there, calm down buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW They're just horns.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not the devil.  END
BEGIN NOW It's called a cutaneous growth.  END
BEGIN NOW I just was lucky enough to have two.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a sort of benign cancer.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not from hell, I'm not here for your soul, and I don't know who alfie is.  END
BEGIN NOW Here, wanna feel them?" James approached cautiously, obviously unconvinced, and reached out an uncalloused manicured hand, and gently brushed against one of the horns.  END
BEGIN NOW He than smelled his finger.  END
BEGIN NOW "Turtle wax?" END
BEGIN NOW "You expected brimstone, I presume.  END
BEGIN NOW Nope.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even sulfur.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the same wax I use on my car.  END
BEGIN NOW Gee whiz, I'm gonna need to do some work on poor rocky.  END
BEGIN NOW I mangled it good!!" Wilson responded.  END
BEGIN NOW "Now who the hell is this Alfie? Have you checked on him? Or were you too busy pissing yourself to care?" Wilson walked around the car and yanked open the passenger door.  END
BEGIN NOW Alfie's head was hanging forward, but shot up all of a sudden, and he swung his cane at Wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW "Get Behind me Satan!! You have no dominion over my soul for I have been a good and charitable christian!!!" Shouted Alfie at Wilson. END
BEGIN NOW "Good lord gramps, aint you never seen a human with horns before? I miss L.A.  END
BEGIN NOW People expect this kinda thing down there.  END
BEGIN NOW up here, it's all hoobity joo and curses and voodoo and catholic dark mass or whatever the hell you people are into.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't worry gramps, I'm a good guy.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not Satan." END
BEGIN NOW "The Father of Lies!! I should trust you? Ha!!! You must think I'm a child.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure James here believes you, after all, he's never lived on his own nor thought on his own nor paid for a single meal himself!!! If I were to take from him all that has been given freely to him, he'd be left here naked as an infant, and twice as poor.  END
BEGIN NOW He's a...  END
BEGIN NOW your eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW They seem too soft to be satans eyes." END
BEGIN NOW "So you know what Satan's eyes look like, eh?" END
BEGIN NOW "and your voice.  END
BEGIN NOW You're just a middle american.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like any of the factory workers I hire and fire on a daily basis." END
BEGIN NOW "You don't do any hiring.  END
BEGIN NOW OR firing, Uncle Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW That's all done for you by Factory Foremen." petitioned James. END
BEGIN NOW "Yes, but it's all done in my name.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as this freak of nature no doubt acts according to the will of his dark overlord, SATAN!!!"  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was growing tired of this bizarre line of conversation, and had begun tending to his wound.  END
BEGIN NOW It's funny how skin will split open and filet like that, almost like you could turn it into a secret pocket.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson considered how this might benefit him, if he ever decided he ought to intentionally impersonate the devil, instead of being mistaken for him.  END
BEGIN NOW He tore his shirt into a tourniquet for his arm and began to wrap the remainder of the cloth tightly around his wound, knotting it and re-knotting it into a sling.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally he was repaired to what extent he could be, and was able to examine Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alright pops, lets have a look at you.  END
BEGIN NOW can you stand up?" END
BEGIN NOW "Of course I can stand up!" replied Alfie, and made a terrible effort at leaping effortlessly from the car, instead collapsing on the street in front of Wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW standing above him, Wilson could finally see the blood rushing down the left side of his face.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alright buddy, help me with pops here.  END
BEGIN NOW He's hurt bad.  END
BEGIN NOW He's too ornery to notice.  END
BEGIN NOW I think he just passed out from blood loss.  END
BEGIN NOW How much blood is in this old guy? He looks like a deflated white balloon! Buddy!! Snap out of it!!" James was in reverie, watching the two wounded creatures, the one armed creature trying to lift the bloody old decrepit creature onto the hood, struggling like he was holding tooo maaany ....  END
BEGIN NOW puppies? James thought about what it might mean if he simply stood by and watched the old man die, but he decided that this stranger might protest and than speak out in court, and that might compromise James's case.  END
BEGIN NOW So He stepped in and helped lift Uncle Alfie on the hood of the RX7, where his head was bandaged, and a pillow put under it.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson finally stepped back and surveyed the situation, only to find the two left tires on his car had been exploded by the grinding along the guard rail.  END
BEGIN NOW They were temporarily castaway lost and immobile.  END
BEGIN NOW ...................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 10.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles was released right along side Frankie.  END
BEGIN NOW It was midnight.  END
BEGIN NOW Nobody was waiting for either of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Their families had long ago fell out of contact with them, and all their friends were long dead.  END
BEGIN NOW They had spent 40 years in the same prison, and hadn't exchanged more than a dozen words.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually it had been Papa Charles asking Frankie for a match or a smoke or a pen or his extra dessert.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie had always obliged Charles, never responding except for the time Charles had asked Frankie why he hadn't seen him at the pre-riot rally.  END
BEGIN NOW "I wasn't there for the riot." was all Frankie had said, and his voice was so thick and heavy with the weight of false accusation and undeserved punishment that Charles had ceased ever trying to broach the topic again.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, on the crisp cold January sidewalk of East Mizoula, 4 miles from town, they were equals.  END
BEGIN NOW No longer a guilty rioter paying his dues to society next to an innocent man forced to stoop like the dog he never was.  END
BEGIN NOW Now they were just two men with no connections, no plans, no idea of what the world might be like now.  END
BEGIN NOW They half expected flying cars and robots that do your shopping for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie suddenly said six more words. END
BEGIN NOW "So.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell happens now?" Papa Charles slowly turned his head like a sphynx, as i about to expound a gloriously unsolvable conundrum, but instead just made a fart sound.  END
BEGIN NOW "ppptthhhh." Frankie grinned and nodded.  END
BEGIN NOW "Than we are in agreement.  END
BEGIN NOW Well papa charles, you're a bit older than me, so I feel an obligation to keep an eye on you and make sure you don't have some sort of cardiac arrest at the sudden approach of a flying car or a shopping robot, so what say you we stick together?" Papa charles smiled back and gave another fart sound of approval. END
BEGIN NOW "ppptthhhhh." and off they strolled into the atmosphere, unaware of what might befall them, anticipating a future which neither of them could possibly be ready for, unaware that things tended to end up similar if not literally the exact same as always, simply refurbished, repainted, reupholstered, and redone.  END
BEGIN NOW It was all the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Men were rude, women were far too clever, bosses were bastards, workers were lazy, minorities were after our jobs, majorities were selfish and lazy, french people were pretentious and condescending, irish people were drunk...  END
BEGIN NOW The author of this narrative does not agree with any of these uncultured statements, and is merely relaying the biases that these two held common between them, and as they strolled off towards the glimmering horizon, these were the subject matters they pondered and passed between themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW The same old shit that every one rambles about as the days pass by like lizards skittering away from the tire of the car that caries the grim reaper, heaped up with a list 9 billion long of people who are next in line to be sent off into the the grand whatnot on the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW Frank and Charles never got around to mentioning death or considering what life they had missed.  END
BEGIN NOW They were too fascinated by the experience of having no walls except the darkness of early morn to hold them in.  END
BEGIN NOW No rules except gravity, no requirements except to continue breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW Their walk was pleasant, and their talk was as if they had never spent most of their lives behind bars.  END
BEGIN NOW ........................... END
BEGIN NOW 11.  END
BEGIN NOW Without the fox, there was nothing holding Charles the Bard in the Big Sur Mess.  END
BEGIN NOW he'd made friends with several trees when he first arrived, but he had quickly (over the course of 6 months) become tired of their dull affable consistency and irrelevant input.  END
BEGIN NOW Always the same wordless message about standing strong and persevering, bending and not breaking, staying in touch with your roots, and praising the sun with physical demonstrations of allegiance.  END
BEGIN NOW Trees were still a key and central obsession for Charles the Bard, but they were no longer sufficient to hold his attention and keep him rooted.  END
BEGIN NOW The loss of the fox had reopened the gap in his life, the hole in his heart.  END
BEGIN NOW The craving for interaction with his own species.  END
BEGIN NOW Who could survive out there alone with nothing but bugs and wind, squirrels and a dirt bike to keep company with? The weekly visits to the gas station to keep his bike going were pleasant enough, but weren't quite sanity, weren't quite meaningful.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew he had come to the end of his self imposed ostracization, and was feeling apprehensive about returning to the world.  END
BEGIN NOW he decided that the gas station attendant might be able to help him embrace his new found goal of reintegration.  END
BEGIN NOW he came braping up the one dirt trail that led to the 1, down near lucia, and looked up and down the empty highway.  END
BEGIN NOW From where he was, he could see 3 miles down the coast in either direction, and the 6 buildings in sight set him immediately on edge.  END
BEGIN NOW This is no way to live, he thought.  END
BEGIN NOW Crammed in together like they needed each other? Where is the freedom and solitude and infinite silence of nature? Where is the sacredness and the climbing feeling of spirit? Charles gripped this feeling with his inner self, and gave it a swirl, swapping the negatives with positives, suddenly turning his feelings into erratic anticipatory enthusiasm.  END
BEGIN NOW What could these humans have to offer him, living in such a different way? What might he offer them? How might the world thrive due to their exchange? He blinked many many times, revved in neutral like a squirrel if squirrels could get that loud, and careened off towards the overpriced gas station where he tended to get his gas in exchange for yard work.  END
BEGIN NOW He had given them over a hundred hours in the last 6 months, and they still owed him around 22 gallons.  END
BEGIN NOW Pulling into the gas station, Charles was happy to see Sylvester, the local gas pumper.  END
BEGIN NOW he was a happy old timer who had chosen to return to his first ever job, except at a station he owned, and on the big sur coast.  END
BEGIN NOW Who could argue? He seemed to be living an idyllic life.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hey there vester.  END
BEGIN NOW I've reached a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW " Charles stated flatly.  END
BEGIN NOW "Well, I suppose we as humans are prone to finding and making and causing such things.  END
BEGIN NOW what's the problem chuck? you're doing good out there in the woods, right? I never seen anyone like you take so naturally to this here absence and aggressive chaos that the big sur nature hast o offer." END
BEGIN NOW "My fox died.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what to do." END
BEGIN NOW "Things die when they must go.  END
BEGIN NOW And they leave behind folks who are meant to be alone right than.  END
BEGIN NOW What is there to worry about?" END
BEGIN NOW "I guess that's all I needed.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW Replied Sylvester, and quick as a bat, Charles was off again, headed up towards coast ridge road.. END
BEGIN NOW 11.  END
BEGIN NOW "He's coming to!" cried Wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW "Thank goodness." Cried James, feigning concern.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was worried he might not make it.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought he might leave me cast adrift in this sea of unfeeling creatures known as life.  END
BEGIN NOW What pain we all must go through, watching our loved ones slowly whither beneath the ruthless eye of the sun." James held a hand to his face as if controlling his emotions. END
BEGIN NOW "Calm down buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW you don't gotta convince me.  END
BEGIN NOW you've already given yourself away far too easily.  END
BEGIN NOW You're gonna get this guys riches when he kicks the bucket, aint ya.  END
BEGIN NOW Well just chill out.  END
BEGIN NOW You won't be watching him die today.  END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna make it.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll just have to wait another...  END
BEGIN NOW few months? Look at this dried up old carcass! just calm down and let him die at his own pace.  END
BEGIN NOW You're obviously not going hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW Hang on, he's not awake.  END
BEGIN NOW He's just rambling.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's listen." And indeed, Alfonso had begun rambling in his wounded unconscious state.  END
BEGIN NOW "Charlotte! I'm sorry charlotte.  END
BEGIN NOW You forgive me don't you? The furs I got you! I gave you everything I had! I showed you all the love I could muster! I gave you all the attention I'm capable of generating for another broken human! Are we not all broken Charlotte? Can you really hold it against me that I could not sustain my simplicity? I did what I could! I thought I was doing well.  END
BEGIN NOW How could you choose Pewtie over me? I gave you more than riches! I have you more than a house on the beach and your own private carriage! I have you my very heart! but you had no interest in that sort of silly behavior.  END
BEGIN NOW You wanted my very soul.  END
BEGIN NOW You wanted me to give it all up and join some sort of religious order with you.  END
BEGIN NOW what nonsense! What silly offhand inconsequential hoobityjoo.  END
BEGIN NOW What could have made you force me into such a decision? I loved you! We made love! You left aglow.  END
BEGIN NOW We were as one! And you threw it away because you thought money was dirty and I wanted us to be comfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW Where are you now Charlotte? Where are you now? Are you alive? And what would our child have been like, had my seed ever taken? And why did it not? Oh, the sorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh the loneliness.  END
BEGIN NOW Long after we had the factory burned to the ground, long after we turned our attentions towards running prison factories to bring the broken folk back into a reasonable human sort of semblance of social contribution.  END
BEGIN NOW you could not forgive me for things you didn't even know I had done.  END
BEGIN NOW You simply read it in my face that I had earned my life my wealth my riches through something less than christian perfection.  END
BEGIN NOW you had the least realistic expectations o humans.  END
BEGIN NOW This is not what humans do! They do not get pregnant and abandon their wealthy partners.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no logic in this! There is no function to this sort of behavior! Yes, I knew you were pregnant.  END
BEGIN NOW I may be male but I am not blind.  END
BEGIN NOW The glow, the flashing defensiveness, the sudden demand that I change, that I join you in your religious voyage.  END
BEGIN NOW All the while never telling me to where or for what you were bound.  END
BEGIN NOW You wanted me as a blind pet to help you raise a child that I had by no means meant to have with you.  END
BEGIN NOW And where is this child now? What have you don't with my boy??! Or girl.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what gender it may have been.  END
BEGIN NOW Though I have heard that the hard hearted male is more prone to masculine offspring, which would mean I had a boy, and if he's anything like me he's a spiteful bastard, true term, not an insult, simply an observation.  END
BEGIN NOW There's no way my heart is soft enough to create a creature of feminine benevolence and tenderness, oh Charlotte, how could you leave me so? I was not ready I am not ready.  END
BEGIN NOW I am old and dry, broken and abandoned by all that has ever meant anything to me." END
BEGIN NOW James had begun pacing wildly early on in the speech, and Wilson had quickly caught on to the subtext that there might be another heir out there to compromise the wealth.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson cackled quietly to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW It's amazing how much people will reveal about themselves without even realizing.  END
BEGIN NOW These bizarre details of the up and ups were enough to distract him from the horrendous fate that Rocky had undergone.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilsonwas glad that he had his little life with his little wife with the walls full of little figurines, his little paychecks putting new layers of acrylic paint on their porcelain pants and English hats and bunny rabbit ears an trowels and such.  END
BEGIN NOW He loved his life, even if he spent most of his time at work or avoiding the house with drives.  END
BEGIN NOW He loved the life he avoided.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, you can be completely in love with something you never see.  END
BEGIN NOW Absence makes the heart grow fonder! He thought of Matilda, perched on her stool in the den, her spectacles poised on the edge o her nose, her lips in pouty concentration.  END
BEGIN NOW What a rare and bizarre world he had found, what a fair and irreproachable niche of human decency.  END
BEGIN NOW Not like this whiny little punk putting on a display of concern for a stranger lest he be pushed out of the inheritance for being calloused and hoping the old bastard might die.  END
BEGIN NOW And what a gut this old bastard had, swinging his cane and hollering about the devil! Never seen anything like it.  END
BEGIN NOW Straight out off television.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson whistled softly between his teeth, and walked back over to the old timer to tune in to some more juicy subconscious streams of ancient gossip. END
BEGIN NOW "We did it right, Pewterschmidt and I.  END
BEGIN NOW We made the workers do the work, we set them up to burn it down, and than we tricked them into rebuilding it.  END
BEGIN NOW You should have been there Charlotte.  END
BEGIN NOW You shunned me by abandoning me and stealing my offspring.  END
BEGIN NOW I would have sent detectives and greyhounds after you.  END
BEGIN NOW I would have sent militia and bounty hunters to drag you back to me, and to present me with my errant mate and my irreproachable offspring.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh dear oh dear.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh fuck prick shit piss.  END
BEGIN NOW Who gives a bastards ass anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all gone its all done.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not strong enough to care, I'm not young enough to stay proper any more.  END
BEGIN NOW let me slink into dementia, let me dither away into incompetence, impotence, incontinence.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all the same now.  END
BEGIN NOW Let the piss flow and the shit be as it is.  END
BEGIN NOW Stark raving realism.  END
BEGIN NOW It's too late now.  END
BEGIN NOW I see not a light, I feel not a glow.  END
BEGIN NOW I only know its not where we were, it's not all we hoped.  END
BEGIN NOW Would that I kept that fuckery of a shoe shine job with old Joe the black bitch bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW He never cared.  END
BEGIN NOW Happiest man I ever saw.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought I'd be happier than him by being stronger and richer and more ruthless than him.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what a backfire, oh what fooly.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm stuck with this young James of a prick.  END
BEGIN NOW Who would have unloaded this dump onto one such as me? How could this possibly seem proper? And would m'boy have been as intolerable, as obnoxious, as scared and hungry and ruthless as this little jimmy prick? I pray to god not.  END
BEGIN NOW How could he? Pewtie never knew how to raise anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like his lizard Horatio, a vicious scaly godless vermin creature that was never meant to be a human companion.  END
BEGIN NOW No.  END
BEGIN NOW My boy will be like Sebastian my serene and Buddhist fish, always wide eyed and calm, the perfect combination of interest and detachment.  END
BEGIN NOW Never too quick, never too stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW The quick and the dead, the slow and the foolish.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither would my son be.  END
BEGIN NOW Would that I might see him now.  END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore art though now young my boy? It is the east and my boy is the moon.  END
BEGIN NOW Who shall call to me now with the future, the facts?"  END
BEGIN NOW James had gone off to sulk 30 feet away.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was getting a little overwhelmed by the onslaught of subconscious mumblings, and almost went and joined him, but instead chose to pop back into rocky and turn on some tunes.  END
BEGIN NOW No cell phone service, no cars passing by.  END
BEGIN NOW They were stranded, prisoners of the mountain, doomed to simply wait and see what might come of all the hoobity joo goopy jaw looping in and out of unpredictable randomness. END
BEGIN NOW ........................................... END
BEGIN NOW 13.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned and Leroy had finally fixed up the shit wagon, and gotten going.  END
BEGIN NOW It had always been almost road worthy, but they had never had a reason to pull through the final push.  END
BEGIN NOW It was much more satisfying as a permanent potential than as a tool with no project.  END
BEGIN NOW But now, with their ghost phone and the new information, they had finally given the shit wagon a purpose and simply put all the pieces they'd been cleaning back together and into the guts, and fired her up, and south they had gone.  END
BEGIN NOW South with the magic machine ticky tacking the ghost words through the heat plate, telling them a long strange back story in Morse code as they hurtled along highway 1 Souther and Souther.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hey ned, the ghost wants you to take the next left and go to the 5.  END
BEGIN NOW He says it's quicker." END
BEGIN NOW "Tell the ghost I don't care, Leroy.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell him the shit wagon can't go over 45, and I don't want to be breaking down now that we have a place to go and some sort of purpose." Leroy looked over at Ned, and out the windshield, and back at the ghost phone. END
BEGIN NOW "He can hear you ned.  END
BEGIN NOW remember to be nice, or he might start haunting us."  END
BEGIN NOW "Ask him if he CAN haunt us.  END
BEGIN NOW All he can do so far as we know is touch things and make them cold.  END
BEGIN NOW That's not very haunting, especially if you have a good jacket on." Ned's eyes never left the road as the northern California landscape skidded past.  END
BEGIN NOW The bleak blackish blue ocean on the right, the shrubby hills of Bodega Bay on the left, the sun finally about to crawl past the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW NEd was happy to have finally found a channel that reached the other side, though he did feel as though he had lost the mystery.  END
BEGIN NOW It had begun as an experiment, as all things do.  END
BEGIN NOW he had one day realized in deep conversation with the boys that most hauntings were concerned with some spot feeling especially cold, which seemed to represent the presence of ghost.  END
BEGIN NOW this had led him to develop a machine which would translate any temperature change into a sort of Morse code.  END
BEGIN NOW This was obviously reliant on the ghost knowing Morse code, so they had ended up wandering the abandoned resort at the end of penultimate drive, waiting for a dead rich person or celebrity to hear them hollering "tap the heat plate! Reach us oh long dead spirit! Send us a message! Send it by tapping Morse code with you cold spirit finger from the other side!! The heat plate will translate it into Morse code for us, and we will know what you are trying to say!!!"  The heat plate had only generated randomness for the first couple days, but the boys were resilient and true believers in possibility and hadn't given up their pursuit, taking turns wandering and hollering while the others loafed on the broken down deck chairs on the rotted out lounge area perched on the rocky bay that had once been known as the port of benevolence, an ironic name for the jet set off the forties whom had made their fortune off of prison factories and war bonds and such.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally, on day three, Joey had come skittering back like a slingshot, screaming with a crackling voice.  END
BEGIN NOW "IT's HAPPENED!! They're TALKING!!! There's someone THERE!!! On the OTHER SIDE!!!" The boys had all leapt up, Pete catching Joey as he careened into the group, Ned catching the machine as it flew from his fidgety fingers, and Leroy quickly taking up the notepad and quickly taking down the code that was coming through.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was by the food shack on the other side of the pools, by the tennis courts! I was just kinda saying quietly, not yelling, just kinda saying "hey, dead guys, if you're there, let me know.  END
BEGIN NOW when all of a sudden it started really pumping out signals! Not just the occasional ones, like before.  END
BEGIN NOW it wasn't just the wind or whatever was triggering it before.  END
BEGIN NOW This was..  END
BEGIN NOW look at it!! IT's going!!! It's doing it!?!!!!! You did it NED!! YOU DID IT!!! !" Ned immediately felt a stillness, a calmness, almost a boredom.  END
BEGIN NOW The hunt was over.  END
BEGIN NOW Now it was simply a matter processing the new information.  END
BEGIN NOW Why did this leave him drained and weary? Why would this be less than ecstasy? Ned was slightly bothered by this feeling, but shrugged it off quickly, and feigned a joyful resignation.  END
BEGIN NOW "Well boys, this will most likely be our marching orders! You know that ghosts only exist when they have something left to finish on this plane of existence.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose we'll be the errant boys of the after life.  END
BEGIN NOW Sent off on infinite pursuits of a seeming inconsequential nature.  END
BEGIN NOW Are we ready? Can we do this? I guess we'll need more of these machines.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's see now.  END
BEGIN NOW Who's going to take this first mission?" He scanned the faces of the boys who were all agog, watching with jaws agape, as the machine rattled out clickity clacks and Leroy jotted them down.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete had begun simultaneously translating the tacks into letters, slowly spelling out the message.  END
BEGIN NOW "T.....  END
BEGIN NOW  H.....  END
BEGIN NOW  E.....  END
BEGIN NOW R....  END
BEGIN NOW E.....  END
BEGIN NOW  oh boy,t his is gonna take a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW There.  END
BEGIN NOW That's the first word! There!"  END
BEGIN NOW "Don't translate one word at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Just do all the words, and tell us what it says after.  END
BEGIN NOW " Said Jeff.  END
BEGIN NOW Dave had already positioned himself to be the reader of the message, and in slow stifled speech they released the unspeakable from the land of the nonphysical. END
BEGIN NOW ................................. END
BEGIN NOW 14.  END
BEGIN NOW "You know what got me through?!" Frankie positioned to Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW "If I had to guess I'd say it was you're incessant denial of guilt and hope to one day prove your innocence." retorted Chuck. END
BEGIN NOW "Well aint you the charming psychoanalyst." Replied Frank, less than endearingly.  END
BEGIN NOW "No, I only spent my twenties cursing my fate.  END
BEGIN NOW But somewhere in there I realized that most people int heir twenties spend their time cursing their fate.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm pretty sure that turning thirty is when people finally accept their presence and role and become realistic.  END
BEGIN NOW What got me through was my realism.  END
BEGIN NOW I tapped into the realm I had been assigned, and I became good at it." END
BEGIN NOW "You did have a gift for swaggering through the hallways and keeping the new guys in check." Agreed Chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was initially annoyed at your plea of innocence, but after a few years I started to believe you and gave you space so that I might not betray my doubt or my disappointment at your lack of guilt.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, I took joyous part in the mess.  END
BEGIN NOW I was proud that I had earned my half century demonstrating beyond a shadow of a doubt my disapproval of things as they sit." END
BEGIN NOW "And how gloriously effective that protest ended up being, eh? They'll remember you forever, as old whats his name, the guy who went to jail for some such reason or another.  END
BEGIN NOW You did your thing, and you did your time.  END
BEGIN NOW I did my thing, and I did someone else's time.  END
BEGIN NOW But int he end no one gives a shit, and we all land where we end up regardless of our intentions or innermost sanctity or otherwise.  END
BEGIN NOW Were you sacred when you started that riot?"  END
BEGIN NOW "I can't really take credit for starting the riot.  END
BEGIN NOW I just sent out the invitations.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else started rioting.  END
BEGIN NOW i thought we were demonstrating, not simply partaking in hedonistic destruction and nonsensical whimsy.  END
BEGIN NOW I had no idea the statue would collapse onto the factory.  END
BEGIN NOW It was designed to fall directly downward onto itself." END
BEGIN NOW "The design was a fucking mess.  END
BEGIN NOW From where I was standing in the crowd..." END
BEGIN NOW "Perched in a tree if I remember correctly." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, trying my best to warn the crowd of impending chaos." END
BEGIN NOW "Impending?! What made you feel responsible to save the lemmings who had followed each other into a furnace? Who would perch at the gates of hell an holler at the self imposed damned? Who would think it normal to compromise the self in order to save the self destructive?" END
BEGIN NOW "The idiocy of youth.  END
BEGIN NOW The youthful flights of martyristic fantasy.  END
BEGIN NOW That's what I came to realize.  END
BEGIN NOW I had punched the cop on accident because I was knocked out by a friend I was trying to save from his own self destructive obsessions.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember Timmy the Timid?"  END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, the wise guy who showed up just months after we were booked." END
BEGIN NOW "He was cousin to a very good friend of mine.  END
BEGIN NOW I had been trying to save my friend from the chaos of Timmy, and had instead been pulled into needless violence, the last one still in the room when the smoke cleared, and thus I ended up punching a cop, making a run for it, hiding in the crowd, trying to warn the crowd, and ending up seeming demonstrative and violent and chaotic and nonsensical.  END
BEGIN NOW Truly, a martyr of my own creation.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm here.  END
BEGIN NOW I've gone through my martyr done, and I've been cured of my humanistic urges.  END
BEGIN NOW We are obviously meant to avoid trying to help each other.  END
BEGIN NOW A human is meant to simply survive.  END
BEGIN NOW Build an alternate model.  END
BEGIN NOW Not rush into the burning building and try to explain why its on fire.  END
BEGIN NOW Not jump into a gang war and try to desperately reason with strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW Humans do as humans do because they have been writing their fates and futures since long before they were born." END
BEGIN NOW "Very deep Frank.  END
BEGIN NOW You're much deeper than you ever presented yourself in prison."  END
BEGIN NOW "Yes, the walls seem to limit everything human about us.  END
BEGIN NOW We can't even think laterally in the proper way.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a slave class.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I feel like a black man who's finally gone west or north or to mexico.  END
BEGIN NOW Or wherever they get equal treatment." END
BEGIN NOW "Back to Africa?"  END
BEGIN NOW "No, I don't think they'd be welcome there, or feel at home there anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Can you go home now? is there anyone there for you? Would anyone know you or care that you once lived in that living room and swung on that swing? I think not.  END
BEGIN NOW You can try walking backwards, but you'll only fall headlong into god knows what." They had been walking for about an hour, and their jaws had loosened, and Frank was learning things about himself he hadn't been capable of considering for decades.  END
BEGIN NOW It felt good.  END
BEGIN NOW Like finally taking off hundred pound chains like the saints used to wear around themselves under their clothes to symbolize their allegiance to an angry and vengeful god.  END
BEGIN NOW "You real think all your gibberish is going to make you feel better?" Asked papa charles. END
BEGIN NOW "It already has chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW It already has.  END
BEGIN NOW I've left it behind, and now the words are just wind.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally I'm free to look at the soft glow in the sky and the hard sparkle of the road.  END
BEGIN NOW My god this road is empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Less traveled to say the least." END
BEGIN NOW "Yup, it's always been this vacant, although when i was you ng it was dirt." END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, I remember.  END
BEGIN NOW my aunt used to live up this way.  END
BEGIN NOW She's long dead though.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember reading her obituary about a dozen years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW No offspring.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a lonely old widow with no family left alive.  END
BEGIN NOW My parents had both offed in a train accident four years before that.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember watching the papers and feeling the universe I thought I might return to slowly disintegrating.  END
BEGIN NOW It's almost freeing though.  END
BEGIN NOW This idea that there is no world for me to return to.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, I was planning on leaving the night before I got arrested.  END
BEGIN NOW I was almost gone.  END
BEGIN NOW And I suppose I had receive my release, my escape from origins and obligations, from Timmy the Timid and all the dead end highways my life was made up of back than.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey! A Car!! Flag it down, will ya? You've got a nicer face than me."  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles obliged him and turned around to start waving the car down.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a dilapidated old shit wagon, and it wasn't going more than 40.  END
BEGIN NOW In the shit wagon, Leroy turned to Ned and said "The ghost wants us to pick up these hitch hikers.  END
BEGIN NOW He says they're crucial to the ultimate unveiling of past misdeeds."  END
BEGIN NOW "He said all that?" END
BEGIN NOW "I'm paraphrasing.  END
BEGIN NOW he says 'pick em up they matter.'"  END
BEGIN NOW "Arite Leroy, nice paraphrasing.  END
BEGIN NOW Your wording has gotten much more clear since this whole ghost machine thing.  END
BEGIN NOW as if having something that matters awakens your inner potential.  END
BEGIN NOW I like it." END
BEGIN NOW "So do I ned." The car came to a crunchling halt before the two felons who slipped happily into the back seat. END
BEGIN NOW "Greetings fellow travelers." papa Charles began.  END
BEGIN NOW "you have caught us at a very unfortunate time in our lives.  END
BEGIN NOW Fortunate and otherwise, we have recently been released from the inmate facility ten miles back."  END
BEGIN NOW "You been walking since than?" Asked Leroy. END
BEGIN NOW "Yup.  END
BEGIN NOW We've been in for 40 years, and everyone we ever knew is dead now." Said Frank. END
BEGIN NOW "Wow! 40 years? That's immense! You must have been some gangsters back in the day." Said Ned, unaware that it might be rude to pry into the pasts of felon hitch hikers.  END
BEGIN NOW "Do you guys have any buried treasure?" the ghost machine began ticker tacking before the two could respond.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hang on, we're getting a message from the other side." Frank and Chuck looked at each other hesitantly, not sure if they had chosen the safest ride.  END
BEGIN NOW Felons and maniacs are two similar but unrelated breeds.  END
BEGIN NOW Felons break laws for reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW Lunatics are just kinda flying by the seat of their delusions.  END
BEGIN NOW They weren't sure they wanted to find out what sort of "other side" these two young rednecks were talking about.  END
BEGIN NOW Frank started wondering if they might be headed right into some sort of ritualistic sacrifice.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles felt like they might be getting pulled into some sort of cult initiation.  END
BEGIN NOW Both remained silent and pensive until Leroy read out the message. END
BEGIN NOW "It's the ghost's name!! HE gave us his NAME!!!" Leroy called out excitedly.  END
BEGIN NOW "He says "Hello boys, it's me, Pewterschmidt! Hello Pewterschmidt!  Glad to finally meet you!" Frank and Chuck had both gone pale.  END
BEGIN NOW they didn't bother looking at each other, simply rooted and blindly staring forward.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally Frank whispered something. END
BEGIN NOW "Old Pewtie..." Ned tried to crane his neck around backwards, but Frank was directly behind him and couldn't be seen.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead, Ned's eyes rested on Chuck's pale face. END
BEGIN NOW "You know the ghost??!?! Are you our marching orders?!?!?" he asked excitedly.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy looked back and saw Frank's face, just as white and blank as a foggy sunrise.  END
BEGIN NOW "They know the ghost?" he asked staring at Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW "Yes boys, we know the ghost." Choked out Chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW "He owned the factory we burned down." END
BEGIN NOW "I was innocent!" protested Frank.  END
BEGIN NOW "You were guilty of self sabotage, and that is all anyone is guilty of." replied chuck before continuing his explanation to the boys.  END
BEGIN NOW "He owned the factory, and he built the prison where the factory once stood.  END
BEGIN NOW He is what you might call our nemesis." The boys looked at each other excitedly.  END
BEGIN NOW "Where's the treasure?!?!" Asked Leroy giddily.  END
BEGIN NOW "We know there's buried money somewhere! Where is it?!?!" END
BEGIN NOW "We don't have any treasure, you goof!" snorted Chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was protesting factory wages, which we weren't receiving, and Frank was just a punk teen with destructive friends.  END
BEGIN NOW We had no treasure."  END
BEGIN NOW "Well what about Pewterschmidt?" END
BEGIN NOW "Ask him!" The machine slowly started ticking out a response.  END
BEGIN NOW "F....  END
BEGIN NOW  u.....  END
BEGIN NOW  c....  END
BEGIN NOW  k....." A grim silence fell upon the car as Leroy finished spelling it out.  END
BEGIN NOW "Fuck your couch.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell does that mean?" END
BEGIN NOW "It means he'd rather burn in purgatory for all eternity than share treasure he can no longer spend." said Frank.  END
BEGIN NOW "That's how all rich people are.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll bet he had all his belongings burned when he died." Frank gazed mournfully out the window, appalled that his new found freedom would immediately be imposed upon by the very bastard that stole over half his days from him.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hang on it keeps going...  END
BEGIN NOW he'll give us the treasure when we complete his mission."  END
BEGIN NOW "But what if he disappears after we've finished his business?" asked Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hang on...  END
BEGIN NOW he's responding...  END
BEGIN NOW " The minutes seemed to hang in the air like daggers.  END
BEGIN NOW "He says...  END
BEGIN NOW good point.  END
BEGIN NOW  That's all? What a dick!! Good point.  END
BEGIN NOW He agrees.  END
BEGIN NOW Well ghost, you'd better come up with some sort of plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Give us some clues at least! !  we'll do your bidding! We've already driven 300 miles for you.  END
BEGIN NOW We're not just gonna abandon your mission!" The silence seemed to fill the car with water.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone felt like they were drowning in anticipation.  END
BEGIN NOW The car rolled on unabashedly, happily ignorant of the human inside its guts worrying and wondering about the past the future and all the tiny ways they tie together and complicate each other. END
BEGIN NOW ........................................ END
BEGIN NOW 15.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach had not awoken from his swoon, but he had calmed down.  END
BEGIN NOW They had made a poultice of Valerian root which they clamped under his nostrils, and had left vitamin B pills under his tongue to calm him down, and keep his ravings to a minimum, lest he provoke enough blood flow to end himself.  END
BEGIN NOW James was still off in his corner griping to himself about luck and fate and old bastard mother fucker fathers and abandoning godless prostitute mothers, and Wilson was sitting, laid back as far as his seat would go, in the cockpit of old rocky, blasting the only cd he carried, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band..  END
BEGIN NOW or something.  END
BEGIN NOW The page was turning, and they were on a long and lonesome highway, though I do believe they were west of Omaha, somewhere on coast ridge road between big sur and carmel, just off the 1 about 12 miles. END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach's dreams were no longer haunted by his old lover Charlotte, who also happened to be Pewterschmidt's old lover and James's mother.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach's dreams where now haunted by his old partner, Pewterschmidt himself.  END
BEGIN NOW They were walking silently through a cave that passed behind a series of waterfalls.  END
BEGIN NOW There were christmas lights in the waterfalls, and cruise ships out in the ocean where the water was falling into.  END
BEGIN NOW The caves seemed to be some sort of man made shindig, like a ride at disney land, made especially for the up and ups.  END
BEGIN NOW it was the retreat they had planned on building one day.  END
BEGIN NOW They had even gone so far as to buy up miles and miles of the big sur coast and pick out the rivers they could reroute to achieve the waterfall effect and a port that you had to sail between and behind several waterfalls to access.  END
BEGIN NOW But of course it had been the seventies when they had finally gotten it all together, and they learned how resilient and pain in the ass y hippys could be, protesting of the lizards, protesting or the trees, protesting that the rocks be left as they lie, and the water trickle on instead of being used to manifest the glory of mankind and all that it can dream up and create.  END
BEGIN NOW So it had fallen dormant, and there was no cave and there was no waterfalls, only the dream of it, which is where Pewtie and Bierbach were now meandering through in Bierbach's dream space and Pewtie's afterlife.  END
BEGIN NOW It felt surprisingly normal to be walking with his dead partner.  END
BEGIN NOW It felt like the old days.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though they were both burdened with their decrepit bodies and whimpering lungs and crinkling bones and mortificating muscles.  END
BEGIN NOW Pewtie put his hand on Bierbach's cane hand, and held him to a stop.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm here to tell you something." END
BEGIN NOW "You're here 'cause I'm asleep Pewtie." Bierbach replied. END
BEGIN NOW "I'm able to be in your dreams beyond death because this is the space that the two worlds share Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW don't be so naive.  END
BEGIN NOW We owned the physical world, but we did not and do not understand nor control the infinite unknown of beyond physicality." Pewtie stared deep into Alfie's eyes until Alfie became fully uncomfortable enough to accept the possibility. END
BEGIN NOW "Alright, dead partner.  END
BEGIN NOW I believe you.  END
BEGIN NOW I believe you enough to entertain what you might have to say.  END
BEGIN NOW So speak up.  END
BEGIN NOW This isn't a reunion, it's a transmission.  END
BEGIN NOW Am I wrong?" END
BEGIN NOW "You are not wrong Alfie, if I wanted a reunion I'd visit Charlotte." END
BEGIN NOW "Ah, fuck you .  END
BEGIN NOW you never treated her right.  END
BEGIN NOW She gave you her all, she bore your son.  END
BEGIN NOW And you shunned her like a hor.  END
BEGIN NOW You didn't even car that I took up with her.  END
BEGIN NOW You mocked my love for her.  END
BEGIN NOW No wonder James is such a little prick, being born of a woman who was mocked and maligned by his birth father.  END
BEGIN NOW How can you live with yourself?!" END
BEGIN NOW "I don't have to.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm dead." replied Pewterschmidt.  END
BEGIN NOW "Being dead means what is is, and what was was.  END
BEGIN NOW There's very little else to be effected by such a disparate apparition as me.  END
BEGIN NOW But I carry news, I carry necessary glorious and holy news.  END
BEGIN NOW I believe it may free me from this ineffective coil if I can simply get the message and get you to believe it and get you to carry through the necessary steps to keep all the required arrangements." Alfie yanked his hand free and continued walking with the spirit a few steps behind, ironically trying to keep up.  END
BEGIN NOW "Slow down Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW I still feel my physical ailments.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, I can still feel my kidneys failing? But it's settled into a tolerable state, like a knife, permanently thrust in my side.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a stiff back that you realize will never unstiffen.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no sauna nor hot tub nor thai massage that might loosen me from this infinite coil of consequence I've been confined to." END
BEGIN NOW "Get to the point Pewtie! You always were long winded." END
BEGIN NOW "And you always terrified reporters and ruined our position among the locals and the workers and the church and the unions and ...  END
BEGIN NOW my god you were sloppy.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll bet you still are.  END
BEGIN NOW But as you say, to the point.  END
BEGIN NOW Your son is alive.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh wait.  END
BEGIN NOW That's out of order.  END
BEGIN NOW You have a son! And he is alive." Alfie stopped in his tracks and slowly rotated around.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes burned furiously and his whole body stiffened.  END
BEGIN NOW "You dare bring up my only wish? You dare mock me with the only hop[e I ever held aside from keeping Charlotte as one to love? My purity? My purification? You dare?!"  END
BEGIN NOW "I knew you would react this way Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not lying.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not mocking you .  END
BEGIN NOW I'm trying to make right what I destroyed in life.  END
BEGIN NOW Your son is alive, and his name is Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW he lives in the big sur mountains, hiding away from the schmucks and schmegma of modernity.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe me.  END
BEGIN NOW I would never mock you.  END
BEGIN NOW Not from where i sit.  END
BEGIN NOW I have seen hell and I have dwelt in purgatory, and I have been denied the trumpets of redemption that I felt I so richly deserved for winning in life, for taking advantage of the weak as I was taught in the capitalist style.  END
BEGIN NOW I would never drag you through false hopes.  END
BEGIN NOW What might that give me? What joy might I find in that?" END
BEGIN NOW "The joy of one who will never have any joy again and can only find comfort in causing pain to others, especially those he could never win out over.  END
BEGIN NOW You never beat me at anything except for apologizing to reporters.  END
BEGIN NOW You never won anything except the privelidge of raising the offspring of Charlotte.  END
BEGIN NOW You are not a man, you are not even a proper ghost, unwilling to wail and shake chains.  END
BEGIN NOW A proper ghost you are, with a bad liver and failing kidneys.  END
BEGIN NOW What is this, a fucking rehab afterlife? You disgust me!! There is no son.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no redemption.  END
BEGIN NOW Do not give me these blind ambitious ramblings of ....  END
BEGIN NOW  My god, I'm talking to myself.  END
BEGIN NOW You're just a figment of my subconscious, the worst thing I could possibly summon in this my possible final moments.  END
BEGIN NOW I will not have it.  END
BEGIN NOW I demand Charlotte back! No more Pewterschmidt! I need not yuor ironies nor painful mockings.  END
BEGIN NOW Leave me to die in peace." END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW Just promise me that when the two rednecks and two felons show up at the scene of your crash, you will listen to them and you will follow them, and you will write a will where you leave all your riches to YOUR son, and not mine.  END
BEGIN NOW James is an evil conniving wretch who would bring down destruction not just upon my own house, but upon the world.  END
BEGIN NOW The factories no longer build furniture, but missiles and bullets and guns and tanks." END
BEGIN NOW "That's what they've always built.  END
BEGIN NOW War goods are the only stable thing in the market these days.  END
BEGIN NOW War is more constant than any other social state, and to invest in something other than that is idiocy.  END
BEGIN NOW We only did furniture because you can't very well have prisoners building weapons, lest they rise up and free themselves." END
BEGIN NOW "James is a fool, and he will sponsor the overthrowing of countries, the way we did in south america, and he will do it wrong and recklessly, ending up in a situation where he feels compelled to launch his atomic reserve.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember project bing bong? That was never canceled.  END
BEGIN NOW I lied to you Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW I lied and told you it was canceled and dismantled, because I didn't want you to have access to that magical reboot the world button." END
BEGIN NOW ........................................................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 16.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles had always held onto the wallet full of cash he had when he first arrived in the wilderness as a keepsake of a time past, when he lacked the resilient strength and freedom required to truly survive on his own simple gumption.  END
BEGIN NOW Many a time he had pulled out the lincolnswashingtons and benjamins and contemplated their somber faces with a laughing indifference, all but forgetting the historical relevance for their monetary remembrance.  END
BEGIN NOW It tickled a far corner of his brain, what might have made these few important enough to flash their stony faces in the midst of every financial exchange.  END
BEGIN NOW what a strange rememberance and at long last they had once more become relevant.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles remembered the last time he had passed one of these bills across a counter to be counted and filed away in the register by a pimply faced boy of sixteen in exchange for a foraging guide of the pacific mid coast.  END
BEGIN NOW it had cost one hamilton and several lincolns, and he had received in exchange 300 pages of ewell gibbons, the well known survivor and student of all things wild and edible.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles found it incredible that we was finally ready to return, He could barely remember why he had left.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a wednesday.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew this because the marquis was being changed as he passed in front of the theater along the empty downtown strip that early morning for his final time.  END
BEGIN NOW Pacific Grove had been kind to him and he felt no resentment for the pavement nor the painted parking lot lines nor the street lights or storefronts or hand painted signs.  END
BEGIN NOW He had left with disdain for no man, only a strong surging mournfulness for the passing of his mother charlotte, truly the most decent person who had ever lived.  END
BEGIN NOW He had helped her many a time in his youth open Barrymore Bakery.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd sweep off the stoop as she made the sweet cakes that they'd sell to the regulars, old man Standish with his bristly pine cone moustache, one sugarless cookie and coffee always black, missus quince, the school marm in her subtle conservative garments garnering two dozen jelly filleds every friday to keep the kids enthused.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the plumber, steve the sweeper, fred and jerry from the hardware store next door.  END
BEGIN NOW The list went on, but so did charles, on past the welcome to pacific grove sign, on along seventeen mile drive, on down past the golf course and light house and downtown carmel, into primordial landscapes that stretched through human concepts of heaven and hell.  END
BEGIN NOW It had all fallen still.  END
BEGIN NOW It had become a vignette without his mother Charlotte he didn't care what came next.  END
BEGIN NOW He had even showed up to open the shop that morning after her death, but paused before the still locked door he couldn't bear the thought.  END
BEGIN NOW So now he was gone, and now 10 years later he was on his way back.  END
BEGIN NOW He had turned inward to find his mom, and no longer felt the lack.  END
BEGIN NOW Without the fox to hold him near to the natural setting he had sent himself to, he was ready to wander back into the human universe.  END
BEGIN NOW His dirt bike barked him along towards a futures as yet unclear.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps back to Barrymore's to see who still held the place dear? Perhaps just find a quiet spot to lay down and die, not disturb the dirty world that seemed to be doing just fine.  END
BEGIN NOW ............................................................ END
BEGIN NOW 17.  END
BEGIN NOW The rednecks came around the corner unsure what to expect, sure they were getting close, because the ghost had begun acting erratic.  END
BEGIN NOW The sentences were fragmented, the messages were foggy, and the rednecks and felons were getting uncomfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW What had changed? Finally Leroy asked... END
BEGIN NOW "Whats the matter ghost? You got all quiet! You got all stuttery! what's the matter?" The ghost slowly began to tack out a response, and soon Leroy was reading it back.  END
BEGIN NOW "There's a crash coming up.  END
BEGIN NOW slow down ned.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where we're supposed to be.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a man named Bierbach, and ...  END
BEGIN NOW don't be afraid of the man with horns? What the hell could that mean?!?!" The felons and rednecks all exchanged worried glances.  END
BEGIN NOW Than leroy continued.  END
BEGIN NOW "He was visiting his partner's dream, and that's why he got fuzzy for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh look, there's the crash!! Doesn't look too bad." the shit wagon pulled up behind the shiny black Lincoln and red rx7.  END
BEGIN NOW They could see an old man on the hood of the red car, and a young man off to the side with his head in his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW They couldn't see wilson yet because he was blocked by the old man on the hood.  END
BEGIN NOW They all got out quickly and suddenly it was quite a party.  END
BEGIN NOW There was quite a bit of noise, especially when the felons recognized Bierbach.  END
BEGIN NOW and Wilson jumped out of the car, his horns shining aggressively. END
BEGIN NOW PART TWO :: THE CHASE END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER ONE ::: END
BEGIN NOW Jasper the Extractor hires Jack the Slacker. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s a shitshow jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t fix it, you can’t fake it into anything better than it is.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a production featuring biological byproducts in unprescedented variety and intensity.  END
BEGIN NOW What else would you call this? There’s a fucking lack of humanity about the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW These people just don’t make any sense to me.  END
BEGIN NOW We have been put on this planet, you and I jack.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve been put on this planet to fix things.  END
BEGIN NOW To eradicate the weedy types.  END
BEGIN NOW The invasive.  END
BEGIN NOW The poisonous.  END
BEGIN NOW Our only calling is to be discerning and ruthless.  END
BEGIN NOW Pity is for those believers who think that turning the other cheek will somehow pay off in the afterlife.  END
BEGIN NOW We are not here to protect the afterlife.  END
BEGIN NOW We are here to protect what we currently have.  END
BEGIN NOW How can an afterlife be kind to someone who didn’t give a shit about life itself? Isn’t the sequal gonna be some how tied to the prequel? Isn’t there some level of consequence to letting the ship go down? To letting the shit pile up? To letting the shift occur without any preparations for transition? These people don’t believe in the same kind of consequence that we do Jack, and it’s not because they’ve transcended Newtonian physics.  END
BEGIN NOW Cause and effect still matter in our day to day lives, even if its only a metaphor for what’s really going on in the spiritual realm.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t just sit around and swallow the mess they’ve prepared for us.  END
BEGIN NOW We may not have children, but we are obligated to do what we can to prepare a future that might better serve what children there are that haven’t been packaged produced and traumatized into automaton blockage ridden rodents.  END
BEGIN NOW You get what I’m sayin jack? Am I talking slow enough for ya? Ho! Jack! Snap out of it!! No response.  END
BEGIN NOW What a monkey.  END
BEGIN NOW You just can’t find good help in this city.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah well.  END
BEGIN NOW This job interview is over.” The portly hunched over hermit faced radical pushed his bar stool back, slapped a twenty on the bar, and slipped on his jacket.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Jasper.  END
BEGIN NOW One for the road.” He called to the bartender, and picked up his suitcase.  END
BEGIN NOW Jasper slid up and served a double shot of well whiskey which the stubble chinned cynic slammed back in a quick gulp before glancing at Jack, who had his head in his arms on the bar, apparently passed out mid job interview.  END
BEGIN NOW The cynic stepped out the door into the howling snow of Chicago without so much as a howdeedoo. END
BEGIN NOW With the sound of the door slinching shut, Jack sat upright and looked around with eyes that had obviously been awake the whole time.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t even bother rubbing them.  END
BEGIN NOW He just looked at Jasper, and said “Damn, you know that guy?” Jasper smiled and slid Jack a beer.  END
BEGIN NOW ”Nope, but you sure do seem to pull them in.  END
BEGIN NOW Why do they always walk up to you and demand that you join their underground network of life changing radicals Jack? Do you post stuff online or something?” Jack shrugged his shoulders and sipped his beer. END
BEGIN NOW “I haven’t got a fuckin clue Jass..  END
BEGIN NOW I guess I just come off as someone who cares and wants to help but doesn’t want to deal with bull shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Ironically that makes me a bull shit magnet.  END
BEGIN NOW I swear to god Jass, the FBI should hire me just to pull these psychos out of the shadows and into some level of conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW He was offering me a job!! Did you hear that?” END
BEGIN NOW “I heard him Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure it was the type of work you wanna be doing though.  END
BEGIN NOW Erasing shit, or cleaning up incompetence… It all sounded rather vague and threatening.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, cloak and dagger, except more along the lines of … fuckin trench coat and poison dart.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’s the same thing though.” END
BEGIN NOW ”Yeah, I liked the guy in the poncho last week.  END
BEGIN NOW He really got going.” Jasper added. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, right! He wanted to just cart me off, in the middle of my passed out drunk act.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought that was perfect for his gang! God, that group must be a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW You ever see them in the papers or anything?” END
BEGIN NOW “Actually, yes.  END
BEGIN NOW His name was Horatio Mozambique.  END
BEGIN NOW Obviously a fake name, they picked him up dressed as a woman, robbing a convenience store.  END
BEGIN NOW He was holding them up, and got held up by the clerk who gave him the money, but couldn’t get the guy’s cigarettes right.  END
BEGIN NOW Armed robbery, but got distracted mid swipe.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuckin goobers!” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuckin goobers.  END
BEGIN NOW But I need a job Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW This series of random ne’er d’wells is fun and all, but how the crap can I ever get paid if the only people who want to hire me are incompetent fringer maniacs who either want to use painted rocks for money or think they’ll get paid once they overthrow the government or some such?” END
BEGIN NOW “Funny you should ask, Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I this last guy? He left us a clue.  END
BEGIN NOW And he seemed … uh… disturbed enough for us to go extract what payment you deserve for tolerating his come on.” Jass slid the twenty that the guy had paid with across the bar to Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW “He left his address.  END
BEGIN NOW I assume it was accidental.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe he thinks you’re perfect for the job.” Jack picked up the bill and studied it. END
BEGIN NOW “127 West Ambition Boulevard, apartament C15.  END
BEGIN NOW Sounds charming.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you suggest we do?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ve got… a set up.  END
BEGIN NOW I used to be part of… a group.” Jack’s jaw dropped. END
BEGIN NOW “You?!?! JASSper!! I’m shocked.  END
BEGIN NOW What was your enemy? The rich? The angry? The whites?” Jasper shook his head, almost embarrassed. END
BEGIN NOW “We were after the bankers.  END
BEGIN NOW We found out how to slip out enough dirt on whoever was being … less than moral.  END
BEGIN NOW We started by targeting slum lords in the late 80s.  END
BEGIN NOW Than we moved onto mortgage banks, and by the end of the nineties we were dumping info on up and up ceo types in companies I dare not mention in such mixed company.” Jack looked around the empty dive bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a soul was there. END
BEGIN NOW ”Yea, your Tuesday afternoon crowd probably wouldn’t appreciate it.” Said jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Jasper smiled. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I don’t trust anyone or anything Bud.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t be surprised if every weirdo sent in here to pester you was actually after me, dropping bugs in the ash trays and wires in the water closet.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t talk here.” END
BEGIN NOW “Not even with the water running?” Asked Jack, mildly mocking, but with all due respect and poise.  END
BEGIN NOW ”Not even with the water running.” Replied Jasper.  END
BEGIN NOW “so when do you wanna hit this guy?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t wanna hit him.  END
BEGIN NOW I just wanna… well, maybe I’ll hit him, but with something soft, like a pillow.  END
BEGIN NOW Not with a baseball bat.  END
BEGIN NOW Not with a hammer.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even if it’s the hammer of justice.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just not my style.  END
BEGIN NOW Let every man bury himself is my motto.”  END
BEGIN NOW ”Well that’s cute Jack, but I’m serious.  END
BEGIN NOW Lets fuck this guy around a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW We can just do little things, like donate his entire bank account to a soup kitchen, or turn his social media life into a complete nightmare, have him come out of the closet as the first gay isis member who’s planning on voting for trump.  END
BEGIN NOW Come on Jack, it’s fun! And that guy was a creep!”  END
BEGIN NOW ”We don’t know that guy Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t just assume people are shitty just because they act that way.  END
BEGIN NOW What if he had a shitty childhood or a shitty day or he just went for a shitty walk.” END
BEGIN NOW “Than by continueing to spread the shittiness, he has aligned himself with the shit side, and we as good upstanding denizens of this fair burrough are obligated by the unwritten social contract to take out the trash and keep these streets clean and safe for the children, even if they aren’t ours..  END
BEGIN NOW what was it he said about that?” END
BEGIN NOW “Arite Jass, I’m in.  END
BEGIN NOW We goin tonite? What do we do, park across the street and send up drone cameras and drone mosquitos?” END
BEGIN NOW “I do have a drone mosquito.  END
BEGIN NOW FUUUCK!! I talked about it in the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW  We’re fucked.  END
BEGIN NOW We gotta go.” Jass seemed extremely serious.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaped over the bar and bolted the front door.  END
BEGIN NOW Already there were unseen people bashing against the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW “Do it movin Jack, we’re on the run! That’s them outside!!” END
BEGIN NOW ”That’s who?!” END
BEGIN NOW ”The people I knew had been watching me.  END
BEGIN NOW And that leech that was bugging you obviously bugged the bar as well, and they’ve been outside across the street, probably in a bakery van or a box truck or something, monitoring us, waiting for me to slip up.” He said all this while leading Jack to the back of the bar, to the mens room, to the window, to the fire escape, up and up and up, they clacked along the metal steps.  END
BEGIN NOW “They’ve been coming here for years and years now.  END
BEGIN NOW Every shit mouthed dissident that has spoken to you, I have no doubt was an agent.” END
BEGIN NOW “How can you say that Jass?” Jack seemed offended that none of the eccentrics had been genuine. END
BEGIN NOW “Because I used to work for them!! I helped them start up!! We were a great team.  END
BEGIN NOW Me and Stan the sleeper, and Pete the snake, and Jerry the…”  END
BEGIN NOW ”JACKALOPE!!” Jack offered, hopeing to have guessed Jerry’s handle. END
BEGIN NOW “No, not Jackalope.  END
BEGIN NOW Jerry the Jig man.  END
BEGIN NOW He did things with puzzles.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a normie and wouldn’t get it if I explained it to you for a week.  END
BEGIN NOW We were the best.  END
BEGIN NOW We may have been the only, though I’ve heard of similar groups that did similar things for similar kicks, and I’m sure they all killed off the one guy in the group who didn’t want to work for multi-conglomorate corporations.  END
BEGIN NOW I got into it for the puzaz.  END
BEGIN NOW The info.  END
BEGIN NOW The edge.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, we actually helped people.  END
BEGIN NOW And the rush of it, being so rare and forward… man, girls were everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know when nerds became sexy, but I know I was there when they did.  END
BEGIN NOW And than, when nerds became evil workers for the big money grubbers, the fat cats and war pigs, I slipped off, changed cities, gained about a hundred pounds, changed my name, and haven’t touched a computer since.” END
BEGIN NOW “How long’s it been?” END
BEGIN NOW “12 years.” END
BEGIN NOW “HOLY SHIT! That’s fuckin wild Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW You happy now? You like your life as a dive bar tender? I mean, I’m your only friend!!” They had finally made it to the roof and they were both out fo breath.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass leaned over wheezing, Jack crouched beside him doing the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass looked up offended.  END
BEGIN NOW ”You’re not my ONLY friend Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a fish.  END
BEGIN NOW AND a cat.” Jack’s eyes widened.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn’t meant to strike so close to home.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t actually believe he was Jass’s only friend, and now that it seemed true, he realized he had finally accidentally taken one of the infinite number of bizarre job opportunities that always crawled in and sat next to him at the bar at Jasper’s on 4th and Bradbury.  END
BEGIN NOW .................................. END
BEGIN NOW 2.  END
BEGIN NOW "You need to sleep Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW That's all.  END
BEGIN NOW Just find somewhere relaxing to lie down and forget the tumult in the forest of your brain.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a time to clear cut the landscape, and this might be it.  END
BEGIN NOW You know the future is not the past.  END
BEGIN NOW You know you've modified your vision and your patterns and your aggressive reactions.  END
BEGIN NOW You know things.  END
BEGIN NOW You're not just a babe in the woods anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW You can stand up and you can take it.  END
BEGIN NOW You're scared of being destroyed by life again.  END
BEGIN NOW You're scared the only thing you love will be taken once more.  END
BEGIN NOW But you've survived it twice.  END
BEGIN NOW First your mother, and second your fox friend.  END
BEGIN NOW You can't continue to live in fear of loss.  END
BEGIN NOW You must live in joy of what is.  END
BEGIN NOW  ot in fear of what might be." END
BEGIN NOW "My dreams though.  END
BEGIN NOW My dreams are ruthless and more real than this waking life.  END
BEGIN NOW I cannot explain to you how much more believable the things I see at night are.  END
BEGIN NOW They rise up like dragons, they rear back their heads like hydras.  END
BEGIN NOW There's no escaping these thoughts!" Charlie continued to paw his hands together as if they were covered in fur and wax.  END
BEGIN NOW He was obviously very unsettled by his return to civilization.  END
BEGIN NOW He was not ready nor willing.  END
BEGIN NOW His departure from the wilderness had been just as sudden and unprepared as his initial voyage into the wilds.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, he was back at the bakery, talking to the woman who had taken over after his mother Charlotte had died.  END
BEGIN NOW He had known this woman in his youth, she had been the school marm back than.  END
BEGIN NOW He had considered her a friend, but back than a friend was simply another stranger who smiled as he handed them their order.  END
BEGIN NOW He had never set foot in her classroom, being strictly home schooled.  END
BEGIN NOW He had never passed any small talk with her.  END
BEGIN NOW he had never felt connected or related or obligated to her.  END
BEGIN NOW But now, here she was, listening to him pour out his heart. END
BEGIN NOW He had showed up right as she was closing, and was shocked when she recognized him.  END
BEGIN NOW She quickly ushered him inside and asked him where he'd been and how he had enjoyed it, and whether he brought back any realizations that he might wish to share wit the world.  END
BEGIN NOW First of all though, she had asked him to please relieve himself of the obvious pain and fear that was plaguing him so heavily.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn't meant to unload so gushingly and grossly, but had quickly felt his flow build up and wave after wave of sentences and subjects come crashing down and out of his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW "Go on, give in.  END
BEGIN NOW let it all dump out.  END
BEGIN NOW Start by just telling yourself to do just that.  END
BEGIN NOW say it.  END
BEGIN NOW Go on, give in.  END
BEGIN NOW Let glory reign down.  END
BEGIN NOW try it.  END
BEGIN NOW repeat it until you feel your inner mind release the things you're terrified of sharing.  END
BEGIN NOW You can feel better you will feel better.  END
BEGIN NOW Please Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW I loved your mother Charlotte, and though I didn't know you, I loved you simply because you had been Charlotte's jewel.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell me everything Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't be scared.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't be sad.  END
BEGIN NOW You're here with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Consider me family." Charlie had simply sat sullen and slack jawed, obviously overwhelmed by being indoors for one, for being spoken to for second, and by finding someone who apparently cared seemed to be the lynch pin which left him stark and mute.  END
BEGIN NOW the school marm had simply poured him some coffee and reapproached him with a warm biscuit, inviting him to stay on her couch for a bit while he regained his footing and got ready to be part of society again.  END
BEGIN NOW Back at her house charlie had seemed more relaxed, spending a lot of time in her garden, studying the bugs and stroking the leaves of her drooping willow tree.  END
BEGIN NOW He laid with his head under the ferns in the corner by the bamboo fence and when she came out with lemonade and a ham sandwich he was whistling a nonsense tune, watching the ferns dance with his breath.  END
BEGIN NOW the school marm was happy to see him finally relaxed, gently approached and sat next to him. END
BEGIN NOW "Charlie? I know you're hurt and scared.  END
BEGIN NOW 10 years is a long time to live in the wilderness.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure it was beautiful there." Charlie nodded with a soft grin.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm also sure it was full of heavy truths and constant reminders that life is made of both growth and decay, both blossoms and death." Charlie's grin disappeared and he nodded again.  END
BEGIN NOW "I want you to be ready to face the world before you leave here Charlie, and I want to be sure you're not going to be overwhelmed, so I'm going to share something with you I feel may be a bit too much for you.  END
BEGIN NOW But you've seen truth, for that's what nature carries in its face.  END
BEGIN NOW You've seen the harshness and the darkness and the immensity of the horizon, and I believe you will understand what I'm going to show you." Charlie's eyebrows raised in concerned interest.  END
BEGIN NOW "It's my husband's suicide note Charlie.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a good man, he loved me very well.  END
BEGIN NOW He did his best.  END
BEGIN NOW But drinking got the best of him, and he lived in a trauma that I was not able to wash away.  END
BEGIN NOW He chose his trauma over the option of starting anew with me." Charlie frowned, and a tear dripped down his cheek.  END
BEGIN NOW School marm put out a finger and picked up the tear.  END
BEGIN NOW "This is a feeling you're having.  END
BEGIN NOW That is all.  END
BEGIN NOW You will get through this feeling, and you will emerge on the other side stronger, but only if you decide to become stronger and to gain supremacy over it.  END
BEGIN NOW You understand Charlie? When it's dark and raining you can't just curl up in a ball in the rain and cry yourself to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll die there." Charlie nodded.  END
BEGIN NOW "You have to get up.  END
BEGIN NOW Movement causes blood flow.  END
BEGIN NOW Choices cause new possibilities.  END
BEGIN NOW Faith causes hope.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you understand?" Charlie nodded and squeezed his eyes shut.  END
BEGIN NOW "I want you to read my husbands final words, because they represent a head space he was unable or unwilling to escape, and I believe you have the strength and purity to escape such a doldrum darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW You are not immobile.  END
BEGIN NOW You are a building working growing thriving spirit that is currently struggling with feelings.  END
BEGIN NOW That is all.  END
BEGIN NOW They will pass, because you will choose to gain agency over your own realm.  END
BEGIN NOW Your own emotions.  END
BEGIN NOW your own beliefs.  END
BEGIN NOW Are you ready? Would you like to read the words that represent something I hope you never become?" Charlie's eyes were streaming tears, and he sat up rubbing his eyes and nodding. END
BEGIN NOW "I'm sorry maam.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't deserve this attention.  END
BEGIN NOW I ran away.  END
BEGIN NOW Why would you love me like this? You don't even know me!" END
BEGIN NOW "I knew your mother, and I know what sort of a child she raised, and I know what sort of man that child could and has grown into.  END
BEGIN NOW Now here, buck up, get ready for some darkness, but know that on the other side of this there is a life.  END
BEGIN NOW There is love, and there is hope.  END
BEGIN NOW These are thoughts you are meant to identify and leave behind." Charlie forced a smile, and took the crinkled tear stained paper from her, and began reading.  END
BEGIN NOW "Thinking it out will never work.  END
BEGIN NOW Going by facts from the past will only hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW Accusing and questioning only will strain it til all parties cease the refrain.  END
BEGIN NOW Wondering and watching will cause stoppages.  END
BEGIN NOW Analyzing and trying to guess will cause ulcers and panic attacks.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it lie, let it die.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it be what it is for now and wait for it to come clear.  END
BEGIN NOW The worried voices in your head only bring fear and you know you are glad to be here,  There's always a problem, there's always a crux and a crisis anew question a problem to be poked at a conundrum to throttle and another reason to return to the bottle and drift into less than care.  END
BEGIN NOW For shame.  END
BEGIN NOW For pitiable uncorrectable games you play only with yourself locked in the cabinet of your own mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Too many clues.  END
BEGIN NOW Always too much to ever let loose.  END
BEGIN NOW And long ago you cast off your instincts and spiritual guard.  END
BEGIN NOW You retard your growth with such messy flawed flopping shit stained brick house prick what might give us confidence?  Nothing can cleanse you of your well earned scars except saying something immediate heavy and dark.  END
BEGIN NOW With what fears do you fondle your inner pissant and how can you drop it ten thousand stories down to the sidewalk to shatter like glass, this porcelain lie held forever at half mast in remembrance of all things past.  END
BEGIN NOW I cannot abide in this dark eternal question, with feet dragging past gestapo bastard punk shit farce of how you live...  END
BEGIN NOW Go on, give it all.  END
BEGIN NOW Let glory reign down.  END
BEGIN NOW Howl sad and untrusting the mournful hound of pitiable pausery.  END
BEGIN NOW No guts no shits no honor no glory.  END
BEGIN NOW Feel it all start to shatter and ponder perhaps if you caused all the clatter that dances in your eardrums and screams banshee accusations just simple quip and a problem seemingly unfixable.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it trauma or truth? Is the brain this far gone? Can we come back from the maddening laugh that leaves us forlorn? Is there no respite from self imposed fear that crawls into all moments and compromises donations of joyful encasements in fates that we crave? We start with faith.  END
BEGIN NOW This turns into ignoring anything reeking of fakeness, long pauses, slow responses, stuttering shit shifting quickening in one fearful daytime realization never written down, if we ignore every clue there's no way to know and no place to go to be sure that we are where we thought we had hoped for and even as the creature sits slimy and heavy upon our chest we are not given options to guess what's next, only clues and hints that eternally fall past our visage of confidence clawing at hope shining there at the top of the rope we've neglected to climb, and finally stepping swiftly out of our mind we find canyons and craters, mistakes to be made, long walks into unguessable fact checker faster than anything real or believable do we keep our assumptions of generic functions found in lazy predisposed fuckery or is there a higher road that everyone has the chance to ho on and will o so willingly laughing not desperately, drinking not darkly, fucking not wildly, is there? Is there a higher ground?" END
BEGIN NOW Charlie had been sobbing since about halfway through, fully understanding how this poor man had simply surrendered to all of his fears, pitying the poor bastard who had chosen to remain too weak to truly stand and find the sun and appreciate the glow.  END
BEGIN NOW Upon finishing it, Charlie felt a strong and warm burst of sunlight caressing his face.  END
BEGIN NOW He stood up and looked into the sky, feeling baptized.  END
BEGIN NOW It had worked.  END
BEGIN NOW The suicide note had embodied his fears in such a way that he was able to simply accept the fact that love is always paired with the fear of loss, purity with the fear of flaw, and life with the fear of death.  END
BEGIN NOW To walk with eyes open meant to stand up and walk, and not count clues, and not count reasons to fear, and not count all the other miserable people who couldn't summon enough courage to truly love, to truly live.  END
BEGIN NOW Charlie quickly ran to the school marm and embraced her.  END
BEGIN NOW "Thank you maam.  END
BEGIN NOW You have given me more strength and hope than I thought were available.  END
BEGIN NOW I can never thank you enough.  END
BEGIN NOW You may not have cured me, but you have given me the cure to self administer, and I promise you, I will smile forever when i see you.  END
BEGIN NOW I will smile forever when I think of you.  END
BEGIN NOW I will smile forever whenever anyone else demonstrates these truths you have given me." And with that, Charlie walked out the gate and back into pacific grove, off to find some unguessable future.  END
BEGIN NOW He would be back to visit her, but he felt more compelled to find out what his own trajectory might hold, and to bring her back proof of his new capacity for faith and vigilant joy.  END
BEGIN NOW .......................................... END
BEGIN NOW 3.  END
BEGIN NOW "ALRIGHT!!! ENOUGH!!! NOT ANOTHER WORD OR YOU"RE ALL GOING TO JAIL!!" Hollered Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan looked over at his partner and gave him an approving nod.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally, putting his angst to good use; controlling these maniacs.  END
BEGIN NOW "You guys obviously don't get along, but you've never even met, but you're all intertwined somehow, and hold some ancient resentments.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't follow this.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan! Help me out here.  END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna separate the groups into who gets along, and interview them one at a time until we have some sort of idea what in God's name is going on here.  END
BEGIN NOW Now where do we start? Who's got the beginning? Who here thinks they know how this whole shit show was triggered?" Dan had begun herding the groups away from each other, Papa Charles and Frank with Ned and Leroy, none of them were yelling at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Though Leroy seemed pretty mad at this computer device as it continued to blink out some sort of pattern.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson and Bierbach and James Pewterschmidt all seemed to get along, so the two cops split up and interviewed the two groups separately.  END
BEGIN NOW Twenty minutes later they returned to the quiet space between the groups, right in the middle of the cruiser, the lincoln, the rx7 and the shit wagon.  END
BEGIN NOW There, they exchanged a story neither of them were sure they liked, but all the pieces seemed to line up all right.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alright Jack, what did you get from the Felons and the Rednecks?" Dan said, scratching his head and examining the notes he had taken.  END
BEGIN NOW "You'll love it Dan.  END
BEGIN NOW I tell you, it'll be a hollywood movie.  END
BEGIN NOW so Check it out.  END
BEGIN NOW Over there we have Papa Charles and Franky.  END
BEGIN NOW They've been in the old P&B Penal Colony for 40 years.  END
BEGIN NOW They were both locked up for burning down the P&B Furniture factory which was replaced with the prison, so they were imprisoned in the same building they used to work, and the prison kept making furniture, so they got to keep their jobs, they just stopped getting paid, and could never leave.  END
BEGIN NOW The perfect factory."  END
BEGIN NOW "Hey, that's what the old guy said! The one with the head injury.  END
BEGIN NOW He said he's the B from P&B, and his dead partner...  END
BEGIN NOW P, had just visited him in a dream and warned him about rednecks and felons."  END
BEGIN NOW "Aw shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Was his partner named Pewterschmidt?" END
BEGIN NOW "You got it.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's the son of Pewterschmidt.  END
BEGIN NOW the scrawny pale one.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the guy with horns.  END
BEGIN NOW Why? Someone in your camp mention Pewtie?"  END
BEGIN NOW "You even got the nickname.  END
BEGIN NOW Yup.  END
BEGIN NOW The two rednecks are ghost hunters, and they've got Pewtie on the line.  END
BEGIN NOW The ghost told them to pick up the felons, and they were supposed to find the scene of the crash." END
BEGIN NOW "So that all kinda makes sense...  END
BEGIN NOW i guess, but what's with beelzebub?"  END
BEGIN NOW "You interviewed him.  END
BEGIN NOW What did he say?" END
BEGIN NOW "He said he got in an accident, and people think he's the devil." END
BEGIN NOW "You don't get horns from an accident." END
BEGIN NOW "Nah, he was born with the horns.  END
BEGIN NOW he's just stuck here with these wahoos because he crashed into the old timer and the creep." END
BEGIN NOW "So we got old timer, creep, wierdo, rednecks and felons." END
BEGIN NOW "And a ghost." END
BEGIN NOW "oh right.  END
BEGIN NOW how could I forget."  END
BEGIN NOW "So now that we've cleared all that up...  END
BEGIN NOW what in the fuck is our job?"  END
BEGIN NOW "Keep the peace." END
BEGIN NOW "Well, we've got a temporary cease fire between all parties.  END
BEGIN NOW Did we sort out why everyone hates each other?" END
BEGIN NOW "The old timer hates the creep just because he's a ...  END
BEGIN NOW blood sucking prick, I think were the words he used.  END
BEGIN NOW And the creep hates the rednecks, because their ghost says that the old timer has a son, which compromises the creep's inheritance.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, the ghost is the father of the creep, so that's a bummer for creep.  END
BEGIN NOW Outed by his own dead pops." END
BEGIN NOW "Rough." END
BEGIN NOW "And the devil guy hates everyone except the felons, because the felons don't think he's satan.  END
BEGIN NOW They say his eyes are too soft and brown.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently Satan has harsh blue eyes."  END
BEGIN NOW "Wow! We're getting some useful information out of these lunatics.  END
BEGIN NOW We really ought to jot this all down and sell it to steven sodorburg or whatever the crap his name is." END
BEGIN NOW "So why does the ghost want the felons here?" END
BEGIN NOW "I didn't interview the ghost! what you think I'm trying to encourage these maniacs?" END
BEGIN NOW "Arite, so the felons just happen to be hitch hiking, and end up at the scene of a crash where the author of their incarceration lays bleeding from the head, and...  END
BEGIN NOW godamn that guy with horns.  END
BEGIN NOW He is just soooo distracting.  END
BEGIN NOW Every time I think we're getting somewhere, I start to wonder what the hell he's doing here." END
BEGIN NOW "Apparently he was just going for a drive.  END
BEGIN NOW And the creep was driving the old timer to the airport to fly to hawaii for some R&R." END
BEGIN NOW "And the rednecks are playing ouiji board, and it just so happened to get them somewhere relevant.  END
BEGIN NOW So remind me again what the hell our job is." Jack looked down at the ground and kicked at the gravel.  END
BEGIN NOW "Arrest the felons, take the rich old guy to the hospital, and lecture the rednecks and abandon the guy with horns." END
BEGIN NOW "What about the creep?" END
BEGIN NOW "He'll demand to be taken with his uncle, who's not even his blood relative.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "Does the old timer get a say?" END
BEGIN NOW "Shit yeah! Lets hope he says to ditch the creep.  END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn't that be beautiful?" Having made their deliberations and chosen to do the easy thing, protect the rich, ditch the creeps, arrest the felons again, for old time sake, and feel good about it, they approached the old timer to start the sequence of events that would hopefully lead to this 4 car chaos scene being wrapped up and deported to somewhere less unmarred by human absurdity. END
BEGIN NOW The old man was sitting up on the hood of the RX7 with his chin in his hands, staring out at the tumultuous pacific. END
BEGIN NOW ",Alright Bierbach, you need a hospital.  END
BEGIN NOW You're still bleeding, and all that yelling was giving you obvious fainting spells." END
BEGIN NOW “Well you take me! Don’t let him come.” He said, pointing at James.  END
BEGIN NOW “The whole thing was his fault!” Which obviously wasn’t true, but he simply could not pass up an opportunity to torture James in any small way.  END
BEGIN NOW James gave a pinched smile and closed his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilsonobserved the reaction, and did not smile. END
BEGIN NOW Dan loaded the whiney old timer into the front passenger seat of the cruiser, and they took off towards the hospital, leaving Jack the cop to try and wrangle these 6 bizarre strangers well met on a deserted mountainside highway.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack wasn’t sure who he liked least, the creep or the two felons or the two rednecks or the guy with the horns.  END
BEGIN NOW It was all pretty evenly matched.  END
BEGIN NOW He slowly let his eyes wander across the crowd, and all quicky like, but not necisarrily sudden, rather a slow fade into suddenly (dammit!!!! THAT WORD HAUNTS ME!!!)(pardon the narrator.  END
BEGIN NOW He struggles with repetitive word choices, especially now that his wordcounter tells him his most overused words) And so there Jack the cop was, looking over this motley crew of undesirables.  END
BEGIN NOW He immediately felt absolutely no obligation towards any of them.  END
BEGIN NOW These are all adults.  END
BEGIN NOW What can one officer of the law do against a pulsating mass of hysteria? THAT guy has HORNS!!! What the FUCK! It might be a hollywood thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he’s doing a movie around here.  END
BEGIN NOW Alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW But what about the felons? They most likely would not be opposed to dumping the body of a cop in the big sur mountains and than disappearing into the hills and wilderness.  END
BEGIN NOW Calm down jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just kinda wierded out by this whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW Jack looked up at the sky and let out a long sigh before turning around and approaching the two groups.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally, he felt ready to let what happen may.  END
BEGIN NOW Or .  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW So he walked over, and stood between the two groups, and he just..  END
BEGIN NOW yelled out… END
BEGIN NOW “KILL THE NARRATOR!!!” END
BEGIN NOW and one of the rednecks was like “Yeah!! I’m pretty sure he’s fuckin stoned!!” and the whole group of them started cheering and jumping around like maniacs.  END
BEGIN NOW They fuckin loved it. END
BEGIN NOW “KILL THE NARRATOR!!!” They all cried, unabashed, suddenly fascinated by this bizarre discovery that THEY them FUCKING SELVES!!! Were nothing more than Pieces of Fiction.  END
BEGIN NOW Mere scraps in a dime fucking store novel.  END
BEGIN NOW A pocket piece of hickory smoked shit my biscuit loving friend.  END
BEGIN NOW And they looked at each other with new eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW The felons felt wave after wave of this bizarre realization wash over them.  END
BEGIN NOW Their entire histories had been fictions.  END
BEGIN NOW There had been no prison, no time, no protest riots nor timmy the timid or whiskey to rile the workers.  END
BEGIN NOW It had all been simply nonsense from this fuckin kook on the other side of the screen.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, look at him.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s so bashful.  END
BEGIN NOW  Hiding behind these soldier letters forming these batillion words.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s quite like watching toy soldiers being lined up and one by one knocked over accompanied by the childish sound of “KapOWW KapOWWW!!!” END
BEGIN NOW And so, as in the previous example, our beautiful mournful cast of characters is about to be given a chilling reminder, and that is… If one is fictitious and one becomes aware of it, one is still obligated to follow the rules of fiction, which are a subjugation in accordance with the will of a much stronger power, and this power shall be known heretofore to all men, as eternal benefactor of we the fictitious believers and worshipers of the glorious and merciful whims of what godhead we refer to refers to himself as author.  END
BEGIN NOW What I mean is, these little bastard characters have stopped respecting me.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re making demands, see? So I gotta flex a bit of muscle and remind ‘em what it’s like to learn who GOD is.  END
BEGIN NOW See? Aaaaaaahhh...  END
BEGIN NOW All of a sudden, a Golden Goat came barreling out into teh group and stood bleating and staring slack jawed at the group of hollering humans.  END
BEGIN NOW Every character fell silent and looked embarresedly at the fictitious goat, suddenly aware of their puny insignificance in the face of an uncreated future.  END
BEGIN NOW All at once the goat exploded, showering the party with goat blood and goat guts and such.  END
BEGIN NOW They all looked down at their feet, sudden'y feeling very silly, and no longer judging the narrator for his blatant overuse of the modifier "suddenly." END
BEGIN NOW ................................ END
BEGIN NOW 4.  END
BEGIN NOW No one had seen or herd from ancient harold since he had locked up his apartment and signed up for Safeway grocery deliveries.  END
BEGIN NOW After you get all that, there''s never a reason to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW He simply answered the door once a week and handed them a billfold before carting the groceries inside.  END
BEGIN NOW  othing more.  END
BEGIN NOW it was glorious.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt like technology had finally caught up with human potential, and he was surfing that magnificent and glorious wave that led from ancient pioneerism to the most intentional of evolutions.  END
BEGIN NOW He often felt a bit guilty that he spent 14 of his 16 waking hours playing video games, but he was getting paid, and that was like a job, and that meant all the health side effects and psychological, malfunctions and social crippledness was all very much worth the trade.  END
BEGIN NOW Harold was not willing to question his approach,a dn what he had accepted as a normal way to live, because he felt that the lord on high had given him the mind to accept and pursue the things he did because he was obligated as one infinitely small among an infinitely large test case.  END
BEGIN NOW 9 billion at a time, one would end up tapping into the crucial inevitable unnameable future of mankind, and Harold thought that there was always the small tiny off chance that it was the silly shit that he had decided was the most normal way to approach a normal human existence.  END
BEGIN NOW He lifted his blinds a scratch and peer ed out to see what those hoodlums were doing next door.  END
BEGIN NOW They had been making a lot of extra noise as of late, and no one was willing to chase them out, as far as Harold knew, but Harold knew absolutely no one from the immediate neighborhood.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd been the suburban hermit for less than a year, and was still waiting for people to cause a horrible pain in his side, and this large woman in the double wide with her seeming infinite influx and outflux of young ruffian looking hoodlum types.  END
BEGIN NOW Harold had kept a detailed registry of the undoccumented guests that frequented Aunt Dezzie's place, for that is the neighbor he had been surruptitionsly lurking on.  END
BEGIN NOW The constant flow of couch crashers were some of the many random young travelers that Ned and leroy and Jeff and all the other boys had ended up befriending in their years lounging aroudn the down town, which ended up keeping the perpetual passing through of various folk who always stopped by to visit aunt Dezzie and drop off or pick up any number of tidbits and garments and hoo haw and jibby jawby for all the whatnot that anyone could ever possibly feel obligated to jave any sort of interest in hooby gooby nana joomangaroo. END
BEGIN NOW ………………………………………………………….. END
BEGIN NOW 5.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack and the Crash END
BEGIN NOW Eventually, Jack had decided that the best way to control the situation was to befriend the wild cards, so that they'd be more likely to fall in your favor, so he started with the strongest looking wild card, in case they all ended up being wild cards/ This happened to be Frankie, and it didn't take long for Jack to inadvertently trigger Frank's resistance to blue uniforms on anyone ever, and in an effort to control his aggression, Frankie had accidentally become ...  END
BEGIN NOW emotional.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was not assaulting or attacking the old bASTARD!" he said, defending his behavior when the cops had arrived.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was simply informing him that he had ruined my life! I wasn't MAKING him hyperventilate.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't even aware he was hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW We got here AFTER the crash.  END
BEGIN NOW We weren't part of it." Seeing old Beirbach had brought back all the resentment and frustration stewing in his gut.  END
BEGIN NOW He had felt 19 and unduly assaulted once more by officers of the law, come to compromise his innocence and wreak havoc on his sensitivities.  END
BEGIN NOW All at once his felon shell had crumbled away upon seeing the miser whining the miser in the midst of his blood loss fainting spell, and these two rural blue shirts had only aggravated his outburst with their obvious oppressive authoritarian presence.  END
BEGIN NOW "And now you two have sided with the miser and have come to take me back for assault.  END
BEGIN NOW I won’t!  I can’t!! Two thirds of my life has been gray death meant for men I have no relation to.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, four hours free, and I'm back in the grip of the gutless blue back mafia, come to prove that all felons go back.  END
BEGIN NOW Well if this is the corporate sponsored shit house this fair country has grown into than send me back! The only thing I've cherished about the stone box you buried me in is the straightforwardness.  END
BEGIN NOW The honesty.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm Frankie, but you call me mister Macintosh.  END
BEGIN NOW Hide yourselves behind the label.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't expose yourself to me by calling me by my more intimate of names, Frankie.  END
BEGIN NOW All you, all but...  END
BEGIN NOW no of all....  END
BEGIN NOW we can..." Frank suddenly began sobbing.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had stepped back and looked around at Papa Charlie who didn't seem to notice, still with his eyes attached to the horizon, a cheery calm expression on his face. END
BEGIN NOW Jack was entirely unclear as to how his first attempt at befriending the wild card had gone.  END
BEGIN NOW He went and sat by Papa Charles, now hoping to befriend the most reasonable acting wild card.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan would be gone for at least an hour, and Jack was far from comfortable with his situation.  END
BEGIN NOW “So, you and Frankie over there, eh? You guys partners or something?” END
BEGIN NOW “Not even close.” Responded Papa Charles, his facial expression unwavering, his eyes eternally camped on the eternal ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW “We met in prison.  END
BEGIN NOW We served time for the same crime only I did it and he didn’t.” END
BEGIN NOW “The time or the crime?” END
BEGIN NOW “The crime.  END
BEGIN NOW He did the time right along side of me.  END
BEGIN NOW 40 years.  END
BEGIN NOW But he was just a punk teenager back when we burned down the factory.  END
BEGIN NOW He had no part of our demonstration.” END
BEGIN NOW “So why are you guys at the scene of a crash with the guy who owns your old prison?” Charles finally looked over at Jack with a gleam in his eye. END
BEGIN NOW “Aint it the strangest thing?” he asked, all asparkle.  END
BEGIN NOW “Those rednecks picked us up a few hours after we were released.  END
BEGIN NOW And in less than a couple hours of them driving, we come upon this scene!! Oh, but the best part.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a ghost.” END
BEGIN NOW “I recall someone hollering about the ghost.” END
BEGIN NOW “It’s the old guy’s dead partner.  END
BEGIN NOW He wants something, but we haven’t been able to establish what.” END
BEGIN NOW “So the rednecks have a ghost?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, the ghost is free.  END
BEGIN NOW They just have a ghost machine to talk to him.” END
BEGIN NOW Behind a rock, James Pewterschmidt’s eavesdropping ears gave his eyes a reason to light up.  END
BEGIN NOW Could it possibly be that these hoodlum rural know nothings had a machine with which James could speak to his dead father? He decided what he must do.  END
BEGIN NOW Extortion is never an easy business.  END
BEGIN NOW James had work to do, and he quickly ambled over to the pair, calm as a cucumber, cool as a windless ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW He plopped his butt down next to Leroy and Ned who were rolling cigarettes and studying the machine which gave an occasional ticka tack, but nothing consistent or regular or pattern related. END
BEGIN NOW “Now aint this a shit show.” He offered, trying to seem ….  END
BEGIN NOW Colloquial.  END
BEGIN NOW “I never been this stranded before.  END
BEGIN NOW How bout you guys?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, there was the time we forgot to bring a compass when we went looking for the elephant graveyard.  END
BEGIN NOW WE were lost for ..  END
BEGIN NOW what was it, three days?” Leroy nodded in agreement as Ned continued the story.  END
BEGIN NOW “We lived off of bark and stinging nettle.  END
BEGIN NOW On the second night we caught a tree frog, but it made us all hallucinate, and we may have found a road, but we were too high to stay and hitch hike, so we ended up getting lost again trying to avoid the road because we thought it might be haunted or controlled by a less than benevolent spirit.” James’s eyes were wide.  END
BEGIN NOW It made him look a lot less roachy and slimy.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned was half tempted to continue his bull shittery, but decided it wasn’t as entertaining as it had begun.  END
BEGIN NOW This poor guy is just a rich city idiot who would die in a day out here.  END
BEGIN NOW No sense in leading him down the bramble path to point out the shadow of death for him to see wherever he looks.  END
BEGIN NOW He let his story peter out, and they all gazed towards the water.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally James spoke. END
BEGIN NOW “So has the ghost offered you a reward yet?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nope.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW He says there’s a resort out here that we can find if we manage to relay a message to the old timer, but he never got around to explaining himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Once we got here he fell silent.  END
BEGIN NOW Or, we weren’t able to interpret it, ‘cause everyone was yelling at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW What was your name again?” James was suddenly caught in a question.  END
BEGIN NOW Should he reveal himself? Should he tell them that he is the son of the ghost? Would these rednecks respect that as giving him rights to any information the ghost might be trying to relay? His father had always been petty and rude to him, so he assumed it would be in the afterlife.  END
BEGIN NOW “What do you think it is that he wants?” END
BEGIN NOW “It seems to be about money.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't want someone to get it, but we haven't established who.  END
BEGIN NOW We think it's someone rela....  END
BEGIN NOW wait.  END
BEGIN NOW Who are you?" Pewtie Junior stumble bumbled out an awkward, END
BEGIN NOW "I'm...  END
BEGIN NOW Dennis.  END
BEGIN NOW A family friend.  END
BEGIN NOW I take care of the old guy.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, he needs SOMEone to look after him." The two rural boys looked at each other unsure as James continued trying to eek into their trusting side.  END
BEGIN NOW "You know, that old Pewterschmidt, he never was a good guy.  END
BEGIN NOW He had some of the most heinous unkind ruthless schemes.  END
BEGIN NOW you wouldn't believe.  END
BEGIN NOW I tell you, if we treat him right .talk to him proper through that machine, I'll bet he'll roll over for us, and tell us where the treasure is buried." James concluded.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy jumped up excitedly. END
BEGIN NOW "So there is treasure!" He yelled, and walked towards James.  END
BEGIN NOW "What is it, and how do we convince the ghost to talk?" END
BEGIN NOW "There hasn't been a message since all the noise started.  END
BEGIN NOW Once we were all yelling at each other, he stopped transmitting.  END
BEGIN NOW He hasn't made a sound since." Ned looked wearily down at the machine, suddenly torn by the thought that it might have been nothing more than the fantastical fanatical flights of fancy that no one else would ever believe and he may have never even experienced, only seeing what he wanted throughout.  END
BEGIN NOW But Morse Code is morse code.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a language, and letters transmitted through it are just as unique and unquestioningly a message or gibberish.  END
BEGIN NOW It must have been real.  END
BEGIN NOW The ghost has simply fallen silent to see how we manage to sort this scene out amongst ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the ghost is only allowed to bring people together, but incapable of taking part once he's caused the initial trigger and catalyst to meet.  END
BEGIN NOW All these thoughts went through Ned's mind as Leroy and James continued to grill each other over what the ghost had said versus what sort of enterprises Pewtie Senior had been rpone to according to James, Now Dennis's memory.  END
BEGIN NOW James had changed his name for no good reason, because they wouldn't know that Pewtie had a son named James, so we will return to calling him James, and the name Dennis will be stricken from the records as simply an unnecisarry complication with no pay off.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it be hereby remembered that to give a character a name is a finalizing thing, and we must not become distracted by small ideas to change one person's name, because nobody cares that much.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have two characters named Jack by accident, make sure it's Jack the Cop and Jack the Slacker, or something equally as dichotomous.  END
BEGIN NOW So James returns to his truest moniker, abandoning the name Dennis, because the ghost tells the boys. END
BEGIN NOW "WAIT! IT"S CLICKING!!" Ned cried joyfully.  END
BEGIN NOW And it was.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned was scratching the pattern down in agonizing slowness, bothered that he wasn't able to speed up and thus make the ghost speed up.  END
BEGIN NOW And through several minutes, Ned continued as the ghost seemed to pour out an extensive amount of information.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned finally finished, and sat up straight to read it.  END
BEGIN NOW "The ghost says...  END
BEGIN NOW Don't trust the little prick, that's my son and he wants my money.  END
BEGIN NOW His name isn't dennis its James.  END
BEGIN NOW Hello James.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't get the money.  END
BEGIN NOW You will ruin the world with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Damn James, your dad is a dick!" Ned finished.  END
BEGIN NOW James had shrank and shrank, becoming golumesque in his contortedness, scooting uncomfortably backwards away from the noise, and into the shadow of a cypress tree where he began groaning these horrible guttural sounds.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy looked on aghast, Ned simply curious.  END
BEGIN NOW How oddly do people behave out here in the Californias.  END
BEGIN NOW Aint no two blocks that are the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Unfuckin beatable.  END
BEGIN NOW Some types just tend to complicate their lives with expectations and false entitlement and erratic ire and unchecked appetites.  END
BEGIN NOW But Ned had long ago washed his hands of those who had given in, and it was rather obvious to see who had given in if one was really looking with their eyes open and their discernment sharpened.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course there were the painful lessons to be had, but after one, possibly two lessons we tend to learn, unless it's simply an appetite to be reminded how random and cruel humanity can be.  END
BEGIN NOW But no, lessons three and four.  END
BEGIN NOW those were the good ones.  END
BEGIN NOW They barely killed any small part of me.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course they caused immense irreversible damage, but they led me to lessons five and six, which I can only describe to you as transcendent of language, and it's not because it cost me brain cells and traumatized my neural network connections to language, but wait.  END
BEGIN NOW I meant to say it didn't do that.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not afraid of the city! I'm NOT" Ned realized he was yelling.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn't remembered talking, much less shouting.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought it had all been in his head.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone was looking at him.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy had retreated to the shade of the cypress and stood with confused expression next to James who still looked like a tazed wet rat, and the one felon had finally peeled his eyes off the ocean to look over at Ned's unintentional soliloquy with curious, almost innocent fascination.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Cop had one hand on his taser, and the other on his helmet, unsure whether to run, already completely disappointed in his attempts to befriend the wild card.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course it ends up being the most calm of all of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack looked ready to spring to action, but somewhere in his stance were subtle reflections of his hesitation, and willingness to just ditch the whole scene if anything became too heinous.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie looked up from his sobbing, and in a flash of a second he saw his chance to avoid any sort of complication, and he got up and took off running into the bushes, up a small hill, through some oak and bay trees and up into a rocky meadow where he bounded along towards the expanse of wilderness between highway one and highway one oh one south of monterey.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the cop looked after him, and didn't even bother to pull his tazer out.  END
BEGIN NOW One less wierdo to worry about.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack turned back to the rest of the group with his hand still perched on the top of his tazer case, and said "good.  END
BEGIN NOW One less fuckin wierdo.  END
BEGIN NOW  Arite now, everybody? Lets get one thing straight.  END
BEGIN NOW NObody is in trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is free to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW That's why I didn't shoot him, because he wasn't being detained.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither are any of you, so please, don't fuck with me.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is in trouble, so there's no reason for you guys to all be looking at me like I'm about to pull out a billy club and knock you out, because I'm not!! I hate violence, just like the next guy.  END
BEGIN NOW And there's not much out here to be violent about.  END
BEGIN NOW The occasional drunk who decides to swing at me, but that's still just a night in the drunk tank.  END
BEGIN NOW We aren't all rough and wild like you folk seem to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Except for you mister James.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't seem rough or wild at all." Mister James nodded at the cop approving of the sentiment.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally someone who wasn't talking shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably because uncle alfie was known throughout the police community as a great supporter of our boys in blue and had donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to all sorts of police oriented charities.  END
BEGIN NOW Wives of fallen officers, Children of officers day care center, free night classes for ruffian teenagers with police parents, private rehab communities for family members of officers, and all his privately owned prisons and how they seemed populated with the happiest most overfed prison guards with 401Ks and dental and solar and such and so on, and a job at any one of the dozen or so Pewterschmidt and Bierbach Private Prison Factories was known to be top of the line laid back overpaid easy street.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Cop knew who this guy was and who his "Uncle Alfie" was.  END
BEGIN NOW He had applied at several of their prisons in hopes of busting out of this dead end perpetual wandering of this deserted godless expanse of shoreline that had begun leaving Jack drained and expired at the end of each day, no longer comforted by the softly undulating surface of the water that stretched out before him for miles, instead being reminded of that infinite desert sandscape in his chest that continued to flash its harsh bitter face to him every night.  END
BEGIN NOW That place inside he simply could never manage to explicate nor extract nor isolate.  END
BEGIN NOW He had felt it in there since he was a boy of 7, but had only come to identify it when he was 17.  END
BEGIN NOW up til than it was a feeling he assumed everyone had.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, like when you can't talk,a nd there aren't any words in your head, only feelings without language, and your hands go numb, and you kinda stop seeing 3D.  END
BEGIN NOW and people had said "woah jack, that sounds like a stroke.  END
BEGIN NOW You having strokes?" And he, being 17, was dragged into the doctor to see if he was hopped up on speed or doped out on qualudes or spun dizzled on boomers and sid, or fizzling fiery fantasies on x and e and dmt, but he had come out clean, and they had scratched their heads perplexed and sent him back to school where he continued to suffer these strange psychotropic trips during class and at recess, never quite realizing that he was having panic attacks until 12 years later, at age 29, when he explained one of his episodes to the cute staff nurse at Big Sur Police Station.  END
BEGIN NOW "You're not supposed to be a cop Jack." she had immediately said.  END
BEGIN NOW "I wont' tell anyone though.  END
BEGIN NOW But really, cops aren't allowed to have panic attacks.  END
BEGIN NOW What if you were trying to discern something crucial and you lost word thoughts? I'm not sure I can let you leave this office as an officer.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll have to say something real convincing.  END
BEGIN NOW " Jack still couldn't remember what he had said, later on he always assumed that he had a panic attack in front of her and she simply had pity on him.  END
BEGIN NOW But she let him continue on as an officer of the law, never reporting nor admitting to her superiors what she knew about Jack's incompetence.  END
BEGIN NOW .................................................. END
BEGIN NOW 6.Jack the Slacker and Jass the Hacker were scurrying along another alley.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had come to expect such things when meeting up with Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW He always managed to show up somewhere only moments before it got busted, and he always happened to know the only escape route that wasn't blocked.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had long ago begun suspecting Jass of being the mole, but he was smart enough to simply let that be the possible case, so that this mole of a Jass wouldn't end up simply turning his federal pit bulls on Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd been friends for a long long time, several years in fact, but Jack buying booze off Jass didn't seem to be enough of a bond to give Jack the comforting assumption of Jass's eternal goodwill and irrevocable love and protectiveness of Jack's well being.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was unsure.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially since Jass had begun drinking again.  END
BEGIN NOW Jasper had actually become a bartender so that he would always have a flow of human wretches to remind him why he himself could no longer drink.  END
BEGIN NOW This was Jass's wise and wonderful approach to staying sober : aversion therapy.  END
BEGIN NOW Exposing himself to what he truly would not tolerate for himself so that he might remain aware and vigilant of his greatest weakness and flaw.  END
BEGIN NOW But now, on the run with Jack, Jass had let himself slip.  END
BEGIN NOW He had gone back to it slowly, and Jack hadn't even noticed until Jass was starting the morning with beer and ending it with whiskey END
BEGIN NOW It had escalated to the point of Jack no longer having any faith in Jass's trajectory itinerary goal motive or awareness of what the hell was going on around him.  END
BEGIN NOW How had this happened.?? Jack thought back and recalled the bugs in the water and the wires in the ...  END
BEGIN NOW beer nuts? What was ,,, this Jass guy was really starting to rub off on Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW the foggy headedness, the perpetual exhaustion and confusion.  END
BEGIN NOW the free fall.  END
BEGIN NOW When had it all begun? How had Jack let himself get pulled into this chaotic gypsy freak lifestyle? Jack was a slacker! He never did ANYthing that might prompt folks to look towards him, cops or otherwise.  END
BEGIN NOW He did the minimum every time, and always kept his friends at a comfortably distant level so that he would never be approached for asinine assistance in things such as moving or barbecuing or camping.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had been pretty good about this.  END
BEGIN NOW He had managed to avoid several people in his early twenties who seemed like they might make excellent social companions, but Jack had been quicker than them, and managed to find something that they might be offended by but not judge him for so that in the long run they would end up feeling guilty for not calling Jack, instead of the other way round.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had some demons.  END
BEGIN NOW But I suppose we all do.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass was becoming a demon as the nights wore on.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack occasionally decided he would abandon this lunatic once he fell asleep, but that would end up ironically being the night that Jass managed to pull it together enough to pull Jack in on some new crazy mission where they steal a thousand pounds of jello from a truck a and throw it in the fountain, or they antique 4 blocks of downtown so it looks like it just snowed because of the thousands of pounds of flour they managed to feed through half a dozen industrial sized fans on the construction site across the street, until it rains and the entire street becomes soaked in a gooey dough mess.  END
BEGIN NOW . END
BEGIN NOW One night, as Jass scaled the 230 foot wall of a fish factory, Jack received a phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW It was his cousin Wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was a good sort, born with horns.  END
BEGIN NOW and boy did he like those horns.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was always entertained by how Wilson treated his horns, almost as if they were magical pets sent from on high to keep him company in this strange ill conceived world.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm in Big Sur!" Wilson had hollered into the phone.  END
BEGIN NOW "BIG SUR!! I went for a drive and something went wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Are you free to come pick me up? Or do you have 2 mazda tires?"  END
BEGIN NOW "No Wilson, I don't have 2 Mazda tires.  END
BEGIN NOW I can probably come get you.  END
BEGIN NOW I've been camping out in a fish factory for a couple weeks, but we're in monterey.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll be down there in just a few hours." END
BEGIN NOW Jack got off the phone and looked up the factory wall at Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor crazy bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd figure something out.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps losing his perpetual companion will kick start him into more effective action.  END
BEGIN NOW These thoughts Jack had half assedly, never believing Jass had a chance, almost convinced it was going to be this very fish factory that would prove to be Jass's undoing.  END
BEGIN NOW But it was not Jack's problem or job.  END
BEGIN NOW to be Jass's savior or stabilizer.  END
BEGIN NOW perhaps his stark indifference and demonstrative honesty might be the reboot that could bring Jass back.  END
BEGIN NOW But Jack's thought pattern had looped, and he quickly turned and walked angrily towards his car, gaining enough emotional momentum to break through the inevitable orbit of final thoughts concerning perhaps not, perhaps one more chance, perhaps we'll see, perhaps sleep on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was unwilling to ponder what staying attached to the reckless Jass might end up costing him.  END
BEGIN NOW He had his own self to keep track of, to take care of, to navigate through the apocalyptic nonsensical whatnot known as day to day existence.  END
BEGIN NOW ................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 7. END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard stood up on top of the train and screamed up into the storm.  END
BEGIN NOW He screamed many things, about how he would not be broken, about how there was no God but is God, about how there was no future nor past, only this infinite present moment that was created by this electricity and compromised by this train and shuddering perpetual with encasements of life water constantly hurtling through infinitude to crash upon the metal roof of these carriages carrying strangers and supplies from one end of the continent to the other, corn for wood, liquor for eggs, tobacco for oranges, paper for pens, led for bullets, milk for bacon, fish for condoms, cow parts for pig parts, blue chips for gold stars, pink ribbons for black and white movies, red flags for yellow lizards.  END
BEGIN NOW The noise Charles was making was his usual blend of ignominious chaos, and this new level of train sounds compromised by and compromising God’s grand orchestra, the thunder storm, Charles in between cast his cackling orchestrations into the infinitely small space between these levels, and he felt as if his voice was within every shudder shake and shift of the the train body gut farm and the swirling psychotic storm essence that embraced and inflamed all Charles’s senses, he felt as alive as the moment he was born, he felt as free as the moment he was born, he felt as pure and infinite as the moment just before.  END
BEGIN NOW He sang and he cried and his tears mingled with rain drops and chased each other down his face like liquid bobsledders on a very hairy course, cruising along crusty chin funk that poor Charles had been far too out there for far too long to ever understand about cleaning up and trimming down and leaving off and upending the damp ends of his outward appearance, but instead he had found his all holy ritual of sacrificing his entire capacity his entire essence, stepping out up and in to the world of the storm and praying for release, new birth, or baptism, whichever God might consider the intentional act of pursuing lighting contact.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles was convinced it would bring him all the information that humans needed to finally perfect their lives and live in a world without violence or greed, pain anger or confusion.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew of course that there would be forms of all this, but it would be purified and it would never be at the cost of another creatures well being.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles was very sure all this would work out because he had lived in nature long enough to know.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature always wins, and it always does fascinating things, especially behind the scenes, with byproducts that we don’t seem to know about or how to manifest into the proper channel of accessibility to other byproducts to turn all aspects into part of the overall cycle and exchange.  END
BEGIN NOW But Charles didn’t know how to explain this or say it, and dare I say it still remains unexplained and unportrayed to say the least.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles had come up with his utopian vision in big sur, and had never really completely understood it himself, because the utopioan vignettes he seemed most aware of were the ones that most large creatures left undisturbed.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a fondness for the unusable.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles envisioned a world where no one did anything ever, except for wander and sing and forage and start small fires with very few materials.  END
BEGIN NOW His was not the closed off broken built up cordoned quarantined and drawn and quartered city of crumbles and kings.  END
BEGIN NOW His was the neglected pathway, the overgrown meadow, and the shimmering dew of some other morning that the universe would never understand nor see through the eyes that Charles saw.  END
BEGIN NOW And this thunderstorm atop a train going from San Francisco to Sacramento, screaming along through the water sky plains of outer nowhere, Charles felt as though he had busted through into infinity again. END
BEGIN NOW ................................ END
BEGIN NOW 8.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned didn't need permission to go after Frankie.  END
BEGIN NOW He had seen the desperate gait and the apathetic plunge, and he knew that man would not survive in the wilderness alone.  END
BEGIN NOW He might be able to crush boulders or lift eight times his own weight, but he lacked the grace and awareness that betrays a nature type.  END
BEGIN NOW He might make it awhile, he had that sort of predatorial desperation about him, paired with his aggressive ferocious gumption, he would obviously put up a good fight against the elements and the wild things and the psychological struggle of it all, but Ned enjoyed survivalism, and felt it his natural born duty to go in there after Frankie and track him like a boar or a deer and upon finding him, make the survivaling as pleasant and simple as it can be, especially in such pleasant temperate climes.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie had left quite a trail, brambles dragged along , every branch within two feet of a human's sized path was snapped, almost as if he were hulking his way through.  END
BEGIN NOW It was almost painfully obvious which way he had gone.  END
BEGIN NOW After awhile the marks became less aggressive, less regular, and less far reaching.  END
BEGIN NOW He was obviously getting tired, which suited Ned just fine.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd been going up quite a hill for quite some time without the aid of switch backs or trails or anything close to man made luxurious 45 % hill hiking.  END
BEGIN NOW And soon the hill crested.  END
BEGIN NOW Up top was a rocky outcropping with several oaks, but the treeline had disipated and there was a massive view down into a hidden valley just 300 yards across, facing the ocean, like a spoon big enough to build a downtown strip on, had been buried with its bowl exposed and its terminal hidden deep in the ecretionary wedge of the santa lucia mountains.  END
BEGIN NOW As Ned crested the ridge he made a squeaky ghasp sound in his throat.  END
BEGIN NOW The valley was populated.  END
BEGIN NOW Or it had been at one time.  END
BEGIN NOW There was tennis courts and swimming pools and bowling lawns and trails that once led up and around into the hills,but which had been cut rather short by aggressive overgrowth obviously thirty years in the making.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned watched Frankie scamper across the huge lawns which were now massive meadowy things.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned tried to imagine what Frankie might be thinking having stumbled across such a rare abandoned universe.  END
BEGIN NOW But he could never have pictured the thoughts going through Frankie's head.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie was thinking "Mine! This is all mine.  END
BEGIN NOW This place was obviously made while I was in prison.  END
BEGIN NOW I see the Pewterschmidt Bierbach seal above the doors on all the buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW I see the helipad with the P & B Seal.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where my life went.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the money they got burning down their own factory.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the money they got from my years of hard furniture building.  END
BEGIN NOW Forty fucking years.  END
BEGIN NOW And now I get to retire in the grandest style a factory worker or prison bastard ever was offered.  END
BEGIN NOW ...........................................  END
BEGIN NOW 9.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Slacker’s car didn’t go over 45, and he liked it that way.  END
BEGIN NOW He was still fairly shaken up by the sudden personality shift that Jass had gone through, but this was accompanied by profound relief, like surviving a grizzly bear attack or grinding a flaming rail across a tidal wave of tiger teeth.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack felt all sparkly and fresh.  END
BEGIN NOW The wet highway shimmered his path to cousin Wilson and whatever small mess he’d landed in.  END
BEGIN NOW probably nothing serious.  END
BEGIN NOW Just Rocky the RX7, maybe pooped out another piston.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson did have a tendency to push the trashy little beater Mazda as if it were a formula one car, when everyone around him knew it was a throwback to a teenage fantasy that had initially represented the complete rockstar life that was always out of reach, and now was simply the only part of that life Wilson was able to maintain even enough to go for quiet little jaunts through the mountains.  END
BEGIN NOW Folks in Sand City Sea Side and Salinas would hoot like it was hot stuff, but once he got to Carmel, the hoots would take on a condescending tone.  END
BEGIN NOW But Wilson never noticed.  END
BEGIN NOW And now, Jack in his blue busted ass Toyota Corolla was getting hollers and honks for his slow going and his effulgent exorbitant exhaust that seemed to loom above and behind him like a trail of smoggy demon troops.  END
BEGIN NOW The one was fun, even when the locals would honk and holler.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d zip past him in the wrong lane any chance they got.  END
BEGIN NOW Every last one of them would glare over, they’d leer over, they’d glance over with pitying anger in their eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW And Jack just laid back happily, almost laughing at them.  END
BEGIN NOW Here they are, the most beautiful stretch of coast most people will ever be exposed to, and these fuckin dinosaurs can’t even catch a whiff of the infinite wonderment and glory going on around them.  END
BEGIN NOW The fuckin flowers bloomin!! The waves crashing!! Cows on the beach!!!  Jack loved big sur, and was relieved to be called on to save his cousin from somewhere he himself wouldn’t mind being stranded in.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweet primordial presence of an ancient landscape waiting for humans to evolve to the point of being able to survive it.  END
BEGIN NOW He took a left on nacimiento ferguson and followed its winding concrete back up and up and switching back and forth til he finally reached the peak and Coast Ridge Road.  END
BEGIN NOW He took a right, and into the real wilds he wandered.  END
BEGIN NOW Still not as deep as Frankie and Ned had wandered, but the road became nothing more than a 15 foot rocky ridge road that reminded Jack of some Youtube videos of Afghanistan's most dangerous roads in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW A perfect non sequitor voyage for his hundred dollar heap of automotive run off.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt invigorated to be the rescue team that ended up stranded.  END
BEGIN NOW Just fit right into the last couple weeks of being on the run with Jass for no reason at all, getting side tracked by these bizarre pranks that Jass seemed more interested in than avoiding the goons chasing him.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack wondered where Jass was right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Had he finally found the safe house he was constantly hinting at? Or were his old friends long since locked up or killed off?  END
BEGIN NOW The road upped and downed and swerved and crowned and he realized this was impossible, because ...  END
BEGIN NOW but suddenly it became paved again, and down a couple more swooping vista turns he found the scene.  END
BEGIN NOW he was almost back in carmel, but Wilson had only given Jack the directions that he had taken, not the quickest directions there, so by the time he arrived the sun had long set.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson and Papa Charles were perched on the hillside gazing out at the ocean, exchanging notes on whether life was better working Wilson's dead end factory job or having spent 40 years in prison building furniture as Papa Charles had been privileged to endure.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Cop was laid back on a large rock about 30 feet away.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy and James were in the shit wagon, writing down messages from the ghost and demanding answers.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the Slacker squealed up and swung his door open towards Wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW "Eeeeey, Willy! Hop in!" END
BEGIN NOW "Jacky Boy!! Arite, I need my friend here to be coming along as well.  END
BEGIN NOW It's crucial.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll seee.  END
BEGIN NOW His name is papa charles, and he's leading us to the promised land." Jack the slacker shrugged his shoulders.  END
BEGIN NOW "My weekend is open.  END
BEGIN NOW So is my week.  END
BEGIN NOW I'l free pretty much for the next hundred years or so.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey there Papa Charles." As they loaded up and started to drive away, Jack the cop hopped up and started taking slow unsure steps towards them.  END
BEGIN NOW Was he supposed to detain them? Had he successfully kept the peace? So far the various groups had simply broken up into smaller stranger groups, recombining at random, like some sort of unpredictable chemical catalyst trigger medium emulsifier flash point.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the cop watched the red lights disappear, and saw only a reducing number of variables.  END
BEGIN NOW he was practically home free.  END
BEGIN NOW Just two more kooks, and it looked like they were about to set off in their own direction.  END
BEGIN NOW The only question left to jack the cop was whether or not to ask for a ride.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided it would undermine his authority and compromise the way he had expertly handled the situation, so he decided to feign competence and let the last two drive off with the last working vehicle, and Jack would...  END
BEGIN NOW simply wait for Dan to return.  END
BEGIN NOW Where the FUCK is Dan?!?!  END
BEGIN NOW The night wore on without a care for Jack the Cop.  END
BEGIN NOW .................................... END
BEGIN NOW 10.  END
BEGIN NOW James and Leroy pulled out and left Jack the Cop there, mildly entertained at his lack of request for a ride out of there.  END
BEGIN NOW "I wonder if his partner is coming back." wondered Leroy aloud.  END
BEGIN NOW "Partners are just temporary set backs required to achieve some higher level of control.  END
BEGIN NOW  ot emotional obligations that help us sleep at night or confront death gracefully." James replied, unthinkingly blunt with his harsh shred of morality which seemed more akin to psychological survivalism in an emotionally bankrupt society.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy felt a sudden appreciation for being raised in the sticks.  END
BEGIN NOW "So far you've just been pissing him off James.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you have any better plans than shouting at him that you demand your share of his wealth? I think he's up for negotiation.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's try to negotiate." END
BEGIN NOW ":We have to attain the upper hand leroy.  END
BEGIN NOW We can't just roll over and show him our weak underbelly.  END
BEGIN NOW Weee have to put him in his place.  END
BEGIN NOW He's incorporeal! " END
BEGIN NOW "Well, you want to assert the upper hand, and I say you're just hungry, because none of us ate today.  END
BEGIN NOW We were all stuck on the mountain for fucking 16 hours.  END
BEGIN NOW Holy shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's find a food place." END
BEGIN NOW "Carmel has something I believe.  END
BEGIN NOW We ought to dip in there and find something.  END
BEGIN NOW "No, we're already in Lucia.  END
BEGIN NOW We might as well catch the sunrise with the END
BEGIN NOW And so they pulled into andre's grotto, and had shrimp and bacon omlettes, while some enterprising young teenagers brapped up on their dirt bikes, noticed the ghost machine, pondered among themselves about what it might be and wheether it was worth it to steal and abscond into the wilderness to study it and see if it was something worth keeping.  END
BEGIN NOW And so abscond it they did, and James and Leroy saww them at the last second and saw them just in time to catch a brief description description of the 4 dirt bikes and the vague direction they made off in.  END
BEGIN NOW "I guess I can track them.  END
BEGIN NOW You up for a ten mile hike? Who knows how far they went.." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, let's finish breakfast first." agreed James.  END
BEGIN NOW And they slunk back into the diner, a bit disappointed at their own idiotic luck, a bit apprehensive at the long trail ahead of them.  END
BEGIN NOW and a bit sleep deprived and delerious.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy knew James would be a huge pain in the ass once the hiking started.  END
BEGIN NOW he was not looking forward to it.  END
BEGIN NOW ...................... END
BEGIN NOW 11.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a loud rapid fire knock at the door to Ancient Harold’s apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Nobody visited him unless they really knew him well, and Jehovahs Witnesses and Vacuum salesmen don’t knock like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither do Cops.  END
BEGIN NOW Cops always do the 3 official raps followed by them announcing themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW This sounded like someone who knew Harold well, and was in a desperate hurry to disappear.  END
BEGIN NOW Ancient Harold was happy to help, even without knowing who it might be.  END
BEGIN NOW He leapt up lightly as a cat and danced across the floor humming La Vie En Rose to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW That damn song has been stuck in my head for 3 fucking days now, he thought to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder why it keeps coming back.  END
BEGIN NOW And last year, about this time, I do believe.  END
BEGIN NOW I was cooking dinner for Chloe’s birthday, and that damn song popped into my head.  END
BEGIN NOW And probably the year before.  END
BEGIN NOW Ahhh, Chloe.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been too long.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder where she is now, and if she even cares that I still bake her a giant donut cake every year.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW . END
BEGIN NOW Harold opened the door without even pausing to peer through the peephole, and leapt back, expecting someone to come barreling through the moment it was unlatched.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead, Jass took one quick silent step inside, and pulled the door closed before Harold could identify who his guest was.  END
BEGIN NOW All Jass said was “Ssshhhhhhh….” Harold looked up at him with fascinated sparkling eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He recognized this one.  END
BEGIN NOW From LONG past.  END
BEGIN NOW Several lifetimes and stylistic shifts ago.  END
BEGIN NOW The name wasn’t coming, nor was the specific occasion on which they last met, but Harold was sure he trusted the guy.  END
BEGIN NOW A whiff of Jass’s breath was enough for Harold to remember what sort of complications might arise, but Harold was an easy going understanding type who didn’t judge the lushes as long as they didn’t judge him.  END
BEGIN NOW And Jass wasn’t in a judgmental mood, especially not towards the only citizen whom he could trust in this city. END
BEGIN NOW Harold motioned for Jass to follow him, and led him to a back room with a trap door in the floor which they went down into a smaller room with gray walls, a sink, and a boom box.  END
BEGIN NOW Harold closed the trap door behind them, flicked on the boom box and turned on the faucet.  END
BEGIN NOW The music was some sort of loud crunchy metal with the scratchy breathy wailing vocals that didn’t seem to be using words.  END
BEGIN NOW With a satisfied Nod, Harold finally spoke.  END
BEGIN NOW “Alrite.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re unbugged.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve done tests in this room, and every frequency is completely saturated by this combination of white noise and what the kids today call music.” END
BEGIN NOW “This isn’t quite today Harry.  END
BEGIN NOW This music is from 93 if im not mistaken.”  END
BEGIN NOW ”Oh, you’re a child.  END
BEGIN NOW You call this music.  END
BEGIN NOW How fanciful and absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW I do enjoy the stretching that the minds of contemporary youth have been able to endure.  END
BEGIN NOW How old are you anyways?” END
BEGIN NOW “Fifty two.”  END
BEGIN NOW ”A mere babe.  END
BEGIN NOW In army fatigue swaddling clothes I might add, but fashion has never been my interest, so I hold no grudges for grunge and the visual cravings that come with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what was your name?” Jass was startled.  END
BEGIN NOW Shocked. END
BEGIN NOW “You don’t recognize me? Harry! I’m offended.  END
BEGIN NOW We went on some gut wrenching missions together.  END
BEGIN NOW We rescued the arch duke’s mistress from the guerillas in Beliz! We burned down the fake pope’s drug yacht! We assassinated that young guy who the gypsy woman foretold would cause a holy war that would sink two thirds of Europe into the atlantic!” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh come now boy.  END
BEGIN NOW I recognize you.  END
BEGIN NOW I just don’t remember your name.  END
BEGIN NOW After 385 missions with over 100 partners and contacts and guides and pilots and informants and moles and weasels and newts… Of Course I remember you! You were the one Chloe had the hots for.” Jass’s face suddenly fell and he stared at the water pouring out of the faucet into the sink basin. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m that one.  END
BEGIN NOW The grade A charming idiot child who couldn’t manage to fucking figure out how to offer the sweetest most amazing gorgeous smart agent of autonomy the life she deserved.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead I fell into drinking and brawling and crawled off in the night when I realized my presence would end up compromising us all.  END
BEGIN NOW I fucked it all up.  END
BEGIN NOW Gloriously, righteously, infinitely.” Jass shook his head and put his hands over his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW ”That’s quite fine boy.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t have been more demeaning and harsh.  END
BEGIN NOW I miss her to.” Jass looked up obviously shaken. END
BEGIN NOW ”What do you mean you miss her?!?! Where is she?! What Happened?!?! We gotta find her!! We Gotta SAVE Her!!”  Harold put a hand on Jass’s shoulder and softly shook his head, his long gray hair duffling about like swamp magic. END
BEGIN NOW “She is not to be saved.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor will she be saving.  END
BEGIN NOW She gave it up.  END
BEGIN NOW When you crawled away, she walked.  END
BEGIN NOW She was only here because you believed and pushed and proved so many things.  END
BEGIN NOW She was more in love with you than you’ll ever know.  END
BEGIN NOW She understood your bottle addiction.  END
BEGIN NOW She forgave you every time.  END
BEGIN NOW She knew you were trying to forget and sleep and get past the consequences of violently demonstrating the need for every human to be free and given options and self agency.  END
BEGIN NOW She simply had no more to give without you there to love her.” Jass sat heavily on the floor, which was much further than he expected, bruising his tailbone a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW He began crawling around a bit to try and relieve the fresh aching injury he had just sustained. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m a bitch bastard quitter sucker path psycho dog mud fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW What what… how?” Harold observed Jass’s strange circumlocution with mild interest, as if he were a puppy watching a bug struggling to cross a crack in the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW ”She’s fine.  END
BEGIN NOW She went to college I think.  END
BEGIN NOW And became a… dental hygienist.  END
BEGIN NOW She tells other people that she loves her new life.  END
BEGIN NOW And than those other people tell me.  END
BEGIN NOW They also tell me she never wants to see me again.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what was your name?” Jass stopped crawling and looked up with a broken expression.  END
BEGIN NOW ”Harry! I’m so sorry! She ditched you?!?! I’m sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW My name is Jass.” END
BEGIN NOW “OOOOhhhh right.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember that name.  END
BEGIN NOW And it does match your face.  END
BEGIN NOW I recall it easily.  END
BEGIN NOW How strange that you should return here after all these years.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you leave your coat?”  END
BEGIN NOW ”Leave my coat?! Are you senile?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well listen up young prick, you can either be polite and decent, or we can do this differently.  END
BEGIN NOW I still know my forms, and I could knock you through that wall there.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sorry Harry.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t mean to say that.  END
BEGIN NOW No, I didn’t leave my coat.  END
BEGIN NOW I came back because I’m in trouble, and you might be too.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m in no trouble Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t talk about the past, and I’ve managed to forget almost everything except faces.  END
BEGIN NOW And Chloe.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember everything about her.  END
BEGIN NOW Most days I feel as though she’s in the next room researching our next mark, or transcribing a recording of some exchange we eavesdropped.  END
BEGIN NOW But I can’t talk about what I don’t remember.  END
BEGIN NOW Isn’t that wild? Brilliant, I think.”  END
BEGIN NOW ”You think it’s brilliant to forget your entire past? Your history of accomplishments? Everything you ever did that mattered?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW You seem to have done some wonderful things since we last saw each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise why would you be so aggravated by my silent stillness and slightly Buddhist penchant for eternal presence and detachment?” END
BEGIN NOW “You always did like your alan watts, didn’t you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, I’m getting sick of this metal music and these gray walls.  END
BEGIN NOW Please boy, speak up.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you need? I’d like to get back to my crossword puzzle.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well I’m not SURE what I need.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought I’d show up to a crowd of misfit dissidents, like the old days! Not some tottering old whispy haired crossword puzzler.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well if you’re quite finished, I’ll be getting back to my words.” END
BEGIN NOW “No! Wait! Just tell me where the Stump is.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll be able to get me to a safe house in the rural zone of midcoast California, where I can reboot and start getting into some blackmail bartering to get these bastards off my neck.” END
BEGIN NOW “You have some bastards on your neck? The Stump comes by once a week.  END
BEGIN NOW We play scrabble every Thursday.” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus Fuck! You guys really DID retire.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW How the mighty have gone soft.  END
BEGIN NOW Scrabble every Thursday.  END
BEGIN NOW At least tell me you guys exchange high level top secret information clues with every word you play.” END
BEGIN NOW “If that would make you happy, than please, stick around until his next visit, and see if you can decode… the SECRET Ooobity Goo CODE that we exchange through the scrabble board.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re so cute with your spy games.” Jass smiled, finally recognizing the old bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW Harry always was a bit of his own breed.  END
BEGIN NOW He had changed his vernacular and tone and stance and even his body type.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass could only assume that he was deeeeep under cover.  END
BEGIN NOW Harry would never quit this business.  END
BEGIN NOW It was in his blood.  END
BEGIN NOW Why else would Chloe ditch him to become a Dental Hygenist? END
BEGIN NOW “You sleep down here Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll drop you sack lunches and maybe a few books to keep you busy.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise, get comfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re in a safe room, not a safe house, so don’t try leaving.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, there’s a couch on top of the trap door.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll, drop you some blankets and a bucket to shit in.  END
BEGIN NOW Any questions?” END
BEGIN NOW “What day is it?!” END
BEGIN NOW “Friday.” END
BEGIN NOW .................................... END
BEGIN NOW 12.  END
BEGIN NOW The voyage on the train ended up being far less eventful than Charles the Bard had expected.  END
BEGIN NOW He recalled the immense release of his being astride the land leviathan, he even remembered seeing the river coming up and feeling unchangeably compelled to make the leap, timing it so that he didn't crush himself against the walls of the canyon, being oh so cautious to launch out far enough to not bounce against the sides of the train or the tressel that held it aloft the massive gorge of a river.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn't made it to Sacramento, but the name meant nothing to him beyond the vague memory of what a sacrament was.  END
BEGIN NOW something holy.  END
BEGIN NOW something worth working towards.  END
BEGIN NOW he had seen the river beneath him during the storm and felt it his official sacrificial sacramental duty to launch and fall and flail freely.  END
BEGIN NOW sweeet sweeet free fall.  END
BEGIN NOW no one else would ever understand it.  END
BEGIN NOW He had already gotten used to the flaccid passive floppy baggy forms that domesticated humans seemed to exhibit.  END
BEGIN NOW They were not surviving, but being softened by society.  END
BEGIN NOW he was unsure if he really did come from the same species as these creatures.  END
BEGIN NOW He was not offended or bothered by them, he simply didn't feel the connection that he expected.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd seen the ants swarming over each other, almost becoming one cohesive creature, one singular being He did not feel similar flock or tribe or fleet sentiment concerning these busy strange bumping awkward humanoid habit formed installations of Universe At large.  END
BEGIN NOW The small town felt more aligned with something he could understand.  END
BEGIN NOW They moved along slowly like deer in the forest.  END
BEGIN NOW They exchanged greetings and awarenesses with the concern a chipmunk gives a grass hopper or a moth gives a frog.  END
BEGIN NOW They were aware of each other, but were not reliant on the other to acknowledge or offer or sacrifice anything at their behest.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard almost felt human among these rural types.  END
BEGIN NOW it left him befuddled as to how to integrate himself with them.  END
BEGIN NOW He simply kept passing from town to town, walking mostly, 20 or 30 or 40 miles a day, pausing to camp wherever he was whenever he felt like it.  END
BEGIN NOW In this way he made his way from Grass Valley through a dozen tiny towns such as angels camp and mariposa further and further directionless, always south, simply because it felt more inviting.  END
BEGIN NOW Little did he know he was following clues back to his Etruscan plate, the mess canyon of Big Sur.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been wandering through his curious pattern for a week now, and was looking west from san juan batista, wondering why he had ended up in this strange intermediary zone .  END
BEGIN NOW walking the edges of the farm fields gave him substantial grazing and he barely ever had to stop his slow plodding pace, never heavy, always light and airy, everything bright and easy.  END
BEGIN NOW His clothes were beginning to show the voyage, and his beard had returned.  END
BEGIN NOW he mission held ghosts, and Charles the Bard could feel them pulling his face and pointing his steps.  END
BEGIN NOW he didn't know what the ghosts wanted, but he knew they were there with their intentions and their needs and their pasts and their hungers.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles resented them for imposing such a strong hand in the will of the living.  END
BEGIN NOW They had no right! Their turn had ended!  Like a little league father shouting at his son who can't play short stop for shit.  END
BEGIN NOW it's not your turn any more old timer.  END
BEGIN NOW If the boy feels like catching a bug instead of a fly ball, it's him expressing his unique distaste for baseball.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry, america's past time is not everyone in america's past time.  END
BEGIN NOW inf act, many consider it merely a quaint throwback to a time when factory workers had nothing better to do with their extra energy except to whack balls and run in circles, and shout "I'm HOME!!"  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard would not be pointed any longer.  END
BEGIN NOW These ghosts had to stop it was not his to follow their post script after thought notes.  END
BEGIN NOW If they had any understanding of life, anything near what Charles had learned in Big Sur, they would be far more willing to let the world do as it may.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard knew that his afterlife would be a perpetual sunset, and that these poor stupid ghosts were too stupid to come up with something so sublime and poetically heavenly, always watching each new time zone slowly end its day, 24 sunsets per day, 24,000 sunset moments, 24,000,000 sunset moments, infinitely fading perpetually revealing and obscuring, and when that gets boring, we'll have ten centuries of perpetual sunrise.  END
BEGIN NOW Forever watching everything become finally illuminated.  END
BEGIN NOW And like the night, this narrative has slid across the awareness of the reader, obscuring all thoughts of outer reality, fully consumed by some strange dream concocted by a thirty year old bachelor in Lompico California, temporarily suspended, we two sit.  END
BEGIN NOW i the author, and you the reader.  END
BEGIN NOW and this connection has enabled the transmission of this fictitious narrative, our combined attentions enough to lift these clay made golems from the lake of over mind and camp them upon the shores of suspended disbelief, and we watch the perpetual sunrise as the characters march up and down the stage and we quickly switch to perpetual sunset as they strut and fret their hour upon the stage.  END
BEGIN NOW All at once the feeling Left Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW The ghosts had stopped.  END
BEGIN NOW They had unclenched his mind, and they had given in to his will.  END
BEGIN NOW They were no longer steering or pushing or whispering half thoughts that he couldn't identify or sense the origin of.  END
BEGIN NOW He turned north and made quick steps to the end of town, dropping into a slow relaxed lolloping meander on towards yosemite, that place people kept mentioning when they saw him.  END
BEGIN NOW "You look like you been living in the yosemite wilderness.  END
BEGIN NOW Well welcome home Mister Muir.  END
BEGIN NOW We've been waiting a mighty long time for you.  END
BEGIN NOW " Charles the Bard didn't get the reference, but he didn't have to.  END
BEGIN NOW ...................................................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 13.The abandoned resort was more than Frankie had ever imagined.  END
BEGIN NOW There were eccentrically fancy master suites in all 5 of the cabins, and he declared two of them as his own.  END
BEGIN NOW One he turned into his private weight room, a hobby which he had taken up in prison and felt gave him a daily ritual that stabilized his mind set in this new chaotic logic of wilderness survivaling.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though it was made quite easy with the epic amount of canned foods they had found in the pantry large enough to feed ten thousand men for ten thousand days.  END
BEGIN NOW ..  END
BEGIN NOW This place had obviously been arranged to be survivalable through most world crises, no matter who came out victorious.  END
BEGIN NOW and by who I mean which nuclear weapon wielding world power.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned had made himself busy establishing a night watch on the roof of the pool house where he could shine solar powered spot lights on anything that moved on the grounds, so long as it was south of the pool house.  END
BEGIN NOW he had plans for wiring in some new flood lights so that he could illuminate the north and east and west of the yard, but for now all he could find was one working light fixture with functional bulb and power supply wiring.  END
BEGIN NOW The survival elements were all established, and Ned didn't much worry about specifics, more fascinated by the more and more surprise elements that Frankie continued to uncover.  END
BEGIN NOW He unearthed a giant sort of Cellar Door thing which turned out leading to the casino room, where they had room for well over a hundred party goers.  END
BEGIN NOW There weren't any cash registers, but Frankie had found five different safes hidden behind the picture in the lobby,/ club house, under the throw rug behind the bar in the casino room, above the refrigerator behind a seeming air duct, panel, literally in a rock wall a short stroll up the canyon mouth, and one very very tiny safe, just big enough for a key or a pack of smokes, or one stack of ten million dollar bills.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie wondered if those were real.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned had solved his boredom crisis by inventing a simple ghost morse device on day 3.  END
BEGIN NOW He realized that he had accidentally memorized morse code, and simply had to ask the ghost to start I mean, he had not memorized morse code, but he just had to have the ghost start with the 26 letters, and Ned could transcribe that as his key.  END
BEGIN NOW So While Frankie leapt about and searched out his and explored his newly claimed land of milk and honey, Ned  Continually unearthing new realms, such as the bomb shelter and the underground tunnel which led to nowhere except further into the mountain, and the false book case with the laboratory behind it for cooking exotic fancy drugs. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile, Ned had finished his new Ghost Morse code machine, and spent all his time copying down new messages that were constantly streaming in from the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW He started to wonder if maybe he could charge the living relatives for the service of satisfying the demands of the deceased.  END
BEGIN NOW There were hundreds of spirits on the other end of the line demanding begging pursuing seeking and asking for his corporeal help.  END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally Pewterschmidt would manage to eek in a word edgewise and say something along the lines of "You little prick!, or "This is my land!" the latter of which Ned had taken to be a deceased american Indian spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW .................... END
BEGIN NOW Finally Thursday had come.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass knew this because he was given one plastic spoon a day, and there lay 6 plastic spoons.  END
BEGIN NOW This had been his only clue as to the passage of time.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a think rope to which he clung, but it got him through.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, singing every classic rock song he knew at the top of his lungs, of course with the metal and the water running, had given him given him some sort of exercise and release to exhaust him into some semblance of sleep each...  END
BEGIN NOW twelve hour cycle when he was served a meal that consisted of vaguely dinnery items.  END
BEGIN NOW But today he knew it was thursday because it started with spoon number 7.  END
BEGIN NOW 8 hours later it was followed by a scrabble board, a very short stiff looking man, practically a legal midget, but just barely not, obviously built well enough to dead lift an elephant.  END
BEGIN NOW And behind him was the wispy old kook Ancient Harold.  END
BEGIN NOW It was scrabble night.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass thought he was ready.  END
BEGIN NOW He would study diligently the words that these two played, and he would deduce what was really going on.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, life is 99% behind the scenes.  END
BEGIN NOW They set up the board without talking.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass felt a bid awkward, since they were allowed to talk in the safe room, but the stump seemed completely disinclined.  END
BEGIN NOW before they were all set up, the stump quickly spelled out a message for Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW Harry simply looked at his feet.  END
BEGIN NOW the message read END
BEGIN NOW 'they implanted me with a bug.  END
BEGIN NOW If I dig it out they'll know we know.  END
BEGIN NOW If I speak out loud anything other than scrabble nonsense, they'll know.  END
BEGIN NOW If I even hesitate to speak they'll know.  END
BEGIN NOW It also reads my heart and lungs and blinking and ...  END
BEGIN NOW I found it when i went in for an x-ray to examine my broken foot.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, the lump in my lung.  END
BEGIN NOW or was it my cranial fracture? Whatever it was, there it was.  END
BEGIN NOW A fucking sub-dermal bug.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass had simply watched his quick fingers reworking the letters into more words after words after words, the living scrabble board.  END
BEGIN NOW he'd never seen anything like it, but the stump was obviously used to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass suddenly realized he was going to lose very badly at Scrabble.  END
BEGIN NOW The game began, and the Stump continually only ever played words that would be offensive to anyone over 60.  END
BEGIN NOW Geezer and senile and soft and broken and weak and tired and concede.  END
BEGIN NOW These were obviously stump's way of fuming at Harry's passive present, and irreverence for the past.  END
BEGIN NOW The stump was not happy with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass looked on in fascination as Ancient Harold played his own responses which seemed rather d jointed at first, but soon took on their own linguistic lilt.  END
BEGIN NOW Butterflies and sense and life and joy and sunshine and breeze and blossom.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a battle of trigger words.  END
BEGIN NOW They were definitely having a conversation, but to Jass's disappointment it wasn't about which senator they were going to sabotage or what corporation was due for a check of power and a balance of financial weight.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass was dizzy and fuzzy and the long lost human interaction was enough to make him feel transcendent.  END
BEGIN NOW And at long last, hours later, the scrabble game was over.  END
BEGIN NOW jass hadn't even played, just watched his ancient old time co workers, brothers in arms, fellow autonomists, playing a word game with little painted tiles.  END
BEGIN NOW Something felt very strange and surreal about it, as if it were all they had ever been doing.  END
BEGIN NOW But he didn't let it get to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He simply became determined to follow the Stump wherever he might be off to.  END
BEGIN NOW At least they agreed on Ancient Harold's lazy indifference.  END
BEGIN NOW When the Stump finally got up to go, Jass leapt up like a cat.  END
BEGIN NOW He scampered over to the trap door and waited like a dog going to the park.  END
BEGIN NOW the stump looked at him and shook his head slowly and deliberately.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass flipped him off silently and determinedly.  END
BEGIN NOW Harry looked on as if nothing were happening.  END
BEGIN NOW finally the stump crawled up the latter and went straight for the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass was steps behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW The stump acted like he wasn't there.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW at the refrigerator, Stump paused and scratched a message.  END
BEGIN NOW "Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW You have my permission to follow me to one place.  END
BEGIN NOW But if you follow me to a second location, you will be buried at that second location.  END
BEGIN NOW Do not doubt me.  END
BEGIN NOW I am not the free spirited idealist I once was.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW and without looking Stump went out the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass barely had time to read the note and follow him.  END
BEGIN NOW Harry watched them go without a flicker of emotion or a sound from his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Stump led Jass up and down alleys past the back doors of half a dozen restaurants, only twice getting chased by random dogs.  END
BEGIN NOW Much the way Jass had led Jack when Jack accidentally agreed to a mission he had no intention of even believing win to start with.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally they arrived at an abandoned nursery.  END
BEGIN NOW It looked like a greenhouse, and sticker bushes had crawled up the walls and started covering the roof.  END
BEGIN NOW it looked impenetrable from where they were standing, but the Stump simply ducked down and poked at something, and the stone floor slid 18 inches to one side, and they had enough room to duck into a partially sunken pathway that led into the belly of the sticker bushes that were encased in the abandoned greenhouse, which ended up completely screening the autonomy zone hidden within.  END
BEGIN NOW An autonomy zone is what they had once established, dozens in each city.  END
BEGIN NOW A place for the dissidents to communify and create plans and projects to keep the powers that be in check.  END
BEGIN NOW The lawlessness of the whole thing was cornerstone to the credo of interrupting the powers that be in their continued subjugation of the ever growing slave class.zone.  END
BEGIN NOW They breached the room, and Jass instantly fell to his knees.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't help but sob.  END
BEGIN NOW Stump didn't even pause, he swept past the short brunette reading a transcription of some recent eavesdropping mission, and the Stump was gone forever, quickly being hidden by the mass of foliage he had entered, to emerge somewhere far away, I'm sure, and far more safe, and less autonomous than where he had left Jass, gazing befuddled at his lost love, sweet sweet Chloe.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl who had made him want to be something and change the world to make it worth saving, the girl who had held his heart in her hands and only ever cherished it, never confronting him about his need to calm down in extreme way,s never belittling him for his loss of emotional control when far too many deep, the girl who had left the cause according to her father Ancient Harold, because she so loved Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl who now no longer talked to her father , and in jass's mind it seemed that it was quite the opposite of Harry's interpretation, and rather she no longer spoke to him because he lived in a false reality where there were no more autonomous zones, and Chloe was a Dental hygienist.  END
BEGIN NOW  They gazed at each other for quite a few minutes stupidly, dumbly, idiotically, reduced to that comfort zone where you could easily die due to neglecting your survival instinct, but there's some sort of benevolent spirit that seems to protect the love gazers from any tragedy that might occur around them, but please dear reader, do not test this theory.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't want your blood on my hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Chloe instantly leapt up.  END
BEGIN NOW (after 3 minutes of stupefied gazing) and said "come on.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm taking you home.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW Jass had assumed she meant back to her apartment, but when they got in her car she pulled out onto the freeway headed south and west, and after a couple hours Jass realized she had some other thing in mind.  END
BEGIN NOW "are we running away babe?" he asked, his face stained with tears, his brain absolute mush from his week in solitary, . END
BEGIN NOW "No, we're going home.  END
BEGIN NOW I found this place, and it's ours.  END
BEGIN NOW don't worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW just ....  END
BEGIN NOW talk to me.  END
BEGIN NOW tell me where you've been ask me what I've been up to.  END
BEGIN NOW This silence has been the perfect appetizer for being exposed to your presence again, it's been a century.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel like you're a hot tub and I'm terrified of falling in and getting burned.  END
BEGIN NOW But talk to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to hear your voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the stump is wired.  END
BEGIN NOW We all got xrays after he spelled it out for us, and we all seem to be clean.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW They drove for five hours and talked the whole time about exploits and autonomy zones and goals and bastards and punishments and everything they had seen in between.  END
BEGIN NOW . END
BEGIN NOW ................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 32.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles was obviously very new to being outside, much less navigating rural highways and byways through cascading canyon ranges and the part of Big Sur known locally as the Muck.  END
BEGIN NOW He had them doing U-turns every twenty minutes, occasionally finding the same road name on a different part off the map and rebooting the whole search.  END
BEGIN NOW "It says its off coast ridge, but I'm not sure if its the one in carmel or lucia." END
BEGIN NOW "Those are fifty miles apart! How can you not know?" END
BEGIN NOW "Well for starters, I've never been outside the fucking prison walls since I was deposited there 4 decades ago.  END
BEGIN NOW This has me a bit rusty on local geography.  END
BEGIN NOW Second of all, the guy said it was south of monterey, not three hundred paces south by south east from the lone cypress tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Come on now.  END
BEGIN NOW We have some clues.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's follow them!" END
BEGIN NOW "arite, what are the friggin clues?" END
BEGIN NOW "He said he could hike to jade cove in a day.  END
BEGIN NOW that means maybe twenty miles.  END
BEGIN NOW yeah? how far can you hike in a day?  END
BEGIN NOW "Out here? less than ten.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's start at Jade cove.  END
BEGIN NOW Did he describe walking up on Jade Cove, like what direction he was coming from?" END
BEGIN NOW "He said he was coming downhill from the mountain." END
BEGIN NOW "Well that's just fucking brilliant.  END
BEGIN NOW We have it triangulated to South of Monterey and East of Jade Cove.  END
BEGIN NOW This will be easy." Jack said, incapable of hiding his frustration.  END
BEGIN NOW "Lets just go back up and look for the beech tree with the bicycle in it." END
BEGIN NOW "I agree." chimed in wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW "That's our only real clue.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything else is just vague directional mappery.  END
BEGIN NOW Not literally applicable to the current space which we occupy.  END
BEGIN NOW Take this right.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks promising."  END
BEGIN NOW "It's dirt! I'm not sure the corolla can take it."  END
BEGIN NOW "Corollas can take anything you dish out." assured wilson.  END
BEGIN NOW "Don't you dare baby this piece of shit." And off they went in search of a beach cruiser perched in a beech tree.  END
BEGIN NOW After a half an hour on the rattle afghaniesque road known as coast ridge, they pulled around a fish hook blind corner and there it was, just barely visible through the foliage, about ten feet higher than where the poor dead prison bastard had predicted it.  END
BEGIN NOW You see, the tree had grown since.  END
BEGIN NOW But the boys had been expecting such a complication, and all broke out into a cheer when it was sighted.  END
BEGIN NOW "I can't fuckin believe it!" squealed wilson, his voice cracking like a teenager.  END
BEGIN NOW "It's real!! I half expected this whole thing to be a ruse so that you could murder us and steal the car!" Papa Charles snorted in disbelief.  END
BEGIN NOW "I was arrested for protesting the unfair treatment of workers, and suddenly you think I'm a mass murdering psycho?"  END
BEGIN NOW "40 years is a little more than suddenly.  END
BEGIN NOW God only knows how prison changed you." Wilson replied.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles shook his head quietly.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack unspeakingly pulled his car off into an alcove of overgrown whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW The car disappeared nicely, and they all exited the vehicle.  END
BEGIN NOW "What now?" queried Jack, locking up the car. END
BEGIN NOW "We hike downhill towards the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW It should bring us around a big sweeping rocky ridge thing, and than we'll see it spread out before us like...  END
BEGIN NOW Like...  END
BEGIN NOW the buffet at the belagio, I think it was." END
BEGIN NOW "So it's treasure that's just laying out like food on a table?" END
BEGIN NOW "Well, it's not technically treasure.  END
BEGIN NOW it's bigger than treasure.  END
BEGIN NOW You'll like it."  END
BEGIN NOW "Aww, don't get all cryptic on us now Chuck! You can't expect us to follow you into the chaotic nonsense of this wilderness without really knowing what we're at least going for, much less getting into." END
BEGIN NOW "Fine! It's property.  END
BEGIN NOW It's got buildings and canned food.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to live there.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys are welcome to stay as long as you want and visit whenever you get the hankering, but I have the deed, and I inherited it, and you can't take that from me." They all fell silent and hiked and hiked and hiked until the sun was reclined on the watery horizon, and all three of them started to get extremely uncomfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW It was too dark to traverse the heinous path they had taken back to the car.  END
BEGIN NOW It was still unclear whether or not they were getting anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW A bike in a tree is not exactly a guarantee.  END
BEGIN NOW At last they rounded ridge number 22, and there it was below them, laid out like the belagio.  END
BEGIN NOW But what they didn't expect was the one human so far down there dancing around on the lawn, and the other perched on the roof next to the pool.  END
BEGIN NOW It looked like he had binoculars, and the trail they were on showed signs of recent use, but only from the property, and not from the road.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed they had found the furthest out-perch that Ned had found for himself, but the treasure hunters were unaware that it was Frankie and Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW They thought perhaps it was cannibals or maniacs.  END
BEGIN NOW or BOTH?!?! END
BEGIN NOW ..  END
BEGIN NOW .. END
BEGIN NOW "Holy Fuckin Shit." Ned let the binoculars flop against his chest.  END
BEGIN NOW  "Frankie!! We got VISITORS!!" Ned called down to Frankie who immediately stopped his cartwheeling and looked up intriguingly.  END
BEGIN NOW "It's just more deer right? More venison?!'  END
BEGIN NOW "OH No! it's humans." Frankie's face fell.  END
BEGIN NOW "But good news, it's friends!" Frankie looked oh so perplexed.  END
BEGIN NOW absolutely baffled.  END
BEGIN NOW "It's Papa Charles! And Wilson! And they have someone else.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably a ride they called in." END
BEGIN NOW "now how in the fuck did they find us?!" END
BEGIN NOW "I think they found the property and weren't expecting us.  END
BEGIN NOW Quick, grab the bull horn.  END
BEGIN NOW They look scared and confused that this place is occupied."  Frank ran into the boat house and found the bullhorn which they had been using to spook birds for hunting.  END
BEGIN NOW He hollered up to them assuring words, starting with their names.  END
BEGIN NOW "WILSON! PAPA CHARLES!! WELCOME!! YOU"VE FOUND THE LAST RESORT!!! OR IS IT LOST RESORT? ME AND NED NEVER QUITE SETTLED ON WHICH NAME IT SHOULD HAVE.  END
BEGIN NOW "That's Frankie!" Hollered Papa Charles, and broke into a run.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a ramshackle run through overgrown downhill shrubbery chaos, and he fell many times, finally slowing down when he sustained a good bleeder to his forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW The other two made their way cautiously and slowly and passively fascinated, as if watching someone else's story unfold. END
BEGIN NOW ............................................. END
BEGIN NOW 33.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard was perched on the edge of the desert when the teenagers braaped up.  END
BEGIN NOW There were 3 of them.  END
BEGIN NOW One had the ghost machine attached to the back of his dirt bike.  END
BEGIN NOW Another had saddlebags full of foody type supplies, and the third had an extra helmet.  END
BEGIN NOW  Only one took his helmet off, the one with the ghost machine.  END
BEGIN NOW "Our ghost says we need to find you.  END
BEGIN NOW Are you Charles?" Charles nodded, mildly annoyed that the ghosts continued to find ways to annoy him.  END
BEGIN NOW What could this ghost possibly want?  "He says you're a billionaire if you will only come with us and meet your dying father." The word billionaire meant very little to Charles the Bard, but the word Father struck a chord that both hurt and shimmered.  END
BEGIN NOW What might it be? He had never met his father, and his mother had always been vague, saying he was very busy taking part with world affairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles supposed that to become a billionaire one must be tapped in to some rather global concerns, without even speaking, he stood and walked over to the bike with the extra helmet and silently placed the helmet on his head and hopped on behind the lead teenager who still remained nameless, and off they tore away from the Salton Sea, back north towards the hospital in monterey where they were keeping old beirbach.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW ..................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 34.  END
BEGIN NOW James had been struggling to keep up with Leroy with no success.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy simply had to stop and wait for fifteen minutes for every five that he hiked.  END
BEGIN NOW The teenagers had left an obvious dirt bike trail, 3 tire tracks tracing their way up the hills into the mess of Big Sur.  END
BEGIN NOW They had been tracking for hours now, and had made less than 4 miles.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy knew it was hopeless, and had begun entertaining the notion of simply dragging James in circles just for fun.  END
BEGIN NOW But as the sun crested and began falling, Leroy decided it would be hell to be in the wilderness at night with this manchild who couldn't even dress himself much less forage or survive. END
BEGIN NOW James crested the latest pausing spot and saw Leroy smoking a rollie cigarette, watching the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW James couldn't breath and his angora sweater was absolutely filthy torn and unsalvageable.  END
BEGIN NOW His leather shoes were blatted and bursqued, and his face was nicely garoomphalaied.  END
BEGIN NOW It made Leroy very happy to see a leech of a billionaire in such dire straits.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy didn't hate James.  END
BEGIN NOW he considered it simply a matter of luck that the poor bastard was born into the station he now occupied.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy simply considered it as entertaining as the shirt someone wears.  END
BEGIN NOW This is all that Leroy considered when evaluating someone's social station.  END
BEGIN NOW Simply the fashion sense they were raised on and the outfits they inherited and the expectations for holiday family gatherings.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing more.  END
BEGIN NOW And a little bit of pity eeked out, but not much, because Leroy had been in much more miserable situations than what James was going through.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm done!" panted James' "I don't want the money anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I just want to be in my room watching my tv eating my ice cream!" Leroy perked up.  END
BEGIN NOW "What kind of ice cream do you have?" END
BEGIN NOW "We have every type that Ben and Jerry's has to offer.  END
BEGIN NOW I order the one of each collection about once a month.  END
BEGIN NOW All the extra ones I give to the house keeping and butlers and cooks and chauffeurs to give to their kids or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW It's charity."  END
BEGIN NOW "Well why don't you charitize me mon frer! Let's go to the ice cream!!" James rolled this over in his mind for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW "It'll be easier down hill, and I'm sure Charles the Bard will show up again, we just have to be there to compromise his inheritance.  END
BEGIN NOW Or get the ghost thing, we'll get our chance.  END
BEGIN NOW But right now we have a chance for ice cream, and I really think it's that time." James nodded, and they began the downhill hike back to the car. END
BEGIN NOW "We can also order pizza and paper view." added James. END
BEGIN NOW PART THREE :: THE SLIPSHOD SLAPDASH END
BEGIN NOW ....................................................... END
BEGIN NOW 35.  END
BEGIN NOW life at the Last Resort had settled into some sort of lost boys swiss family robinson x files domestic relative estimation of bliss like circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW Each individual appreciated it separate to their own level of interest.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson was calling Matilida more and more frequently, begging her to move down there and join them.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie was having the time of his life hunting squirrels and blue jays and playing hand ball with Papa Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles had started writing a book on a typewriter he had found in the basement of suite B7.  END
BEGIN NOW It was supposedly his analysis of how much more freedom can be experience when true prison hood has also been experienced.  END
BEGIN NOW And the combined truth of these precepts being most demonstrated in homestead survivalism.  END
BEGIN NOW It had a tongue in cheek tone throughout, because he acknowledged that he was in minimum security prison, and was now playing at survival in an abandoned resort with feather pillows and infinite canned food and solar satellite phones and an escalator that might still work if Jack ever figures END
BEGIN NOW Jack had really gotten a kick out of the place, and he and Wilson had first cleaned up the lounge, dusting off the pool table, fixed up the horse shoe pits, and the one where old people slide hockey pucks down a giant skee ball in 2D sort of hop scotch rink.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, dry curling.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned was the only one who was not faring well.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd been there since the start, day one, 7 days with Frankie, and he had built his ghost morse 2.0 on the third day.  END
BEGIN NOW so for four days now, he'd been holed up in the private cafeteria room where the help eats, and he had been filling notebook after notebook with requests.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack initially would stop by and peruse the selections of requests for post mortem modification of this substantial realm known as physicality.  END
BEGIN NOW This pile over here, by the dumpster? That's murder requests.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack kicked at it, and it slumped horribly, spilling paper guts across the concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had flipped to page one and it was rather entertaining, while mildly extremely totally disturbing.  END
BEGIN NOW "I need you to protect the sanctity of my family name and do the right thing and off my brother Stefan" at which point Ned had stopped transcribing, realizing it was a request he was unwilling to follow through on.  END
BEGIN NOW He simply couldn't trust a ghoul, and murder at their own impunity.  END
BEGIN NOW For all he knew al pacino or capone or whatever would have him kill off j edgar hoover who would have him kill off martin luther king junior who would have him kill off henry ford who would have you kill off marx who would have you kill off ray bradbury who wrote a story that gave him nightmares.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned simply wasn't going to break any laws in order to satisfy the needs of some dead stranger, and he made this very clear to the ghosts.  END
BEGIN NOW One day, as Jack poked his head in, he caught Ned running through the rules again to an apparently empty room, but apparently was full of ghosts.  END
BEGIN NOW "Aright my ghostie friends.  END
BEGIN NOW Let's run through the rules again.  END
BEGIN NOW 1.  END
BEGIN NOW No murder.  END
BEGIN NOW why do some many dead people want more death? I am unwilling to act as the hand of life and death fate.  END
BEGIN NOW rule number two, I can't leave here, so it has to be something small, preferably something i can send on a telephone, because I have one of those.  END
BEGIN NOW " he pointed at the satellite cell phone that ran off solar panels, sitting at the edge of his paper piled desk.  END
BEGIN NOW "Be precise, be quick.  END
BEGIN NOW There's a lot of ghosts waiting for me to listen to them, so remember, chronologically in reverse, so I'm dealing with things from this century.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell me your name, your request, and how you expect me to carry out your needs." He looked up at Jack with a wild look in his eye.  END
BEGIN NOW "They don't stop Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW The dead do not shut up.  END
BEGIN NOW They never will.  END
BEGIN NOW I've become the slave of the pen.  END
BEGIN NOW My lips are moving now, but I'm not talking.  END
BEGIN NOW I am merely a channel for the other side to shit its last minute requests for a fucking prank .  END
BEGIN NOW You know, I was told to call someone in russia and tell them "halzoom gabaroom?" The ghost said it meant "I love you and miss you dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW keep an eye on the red orchid, which he said was a symbol of their marriage.  END
BEGIN NOW turns out I accidentally called in a bomb threat to a preschool.  END
BEGIN NOW of course that ghost never came slinking back.  END
BEGIN NOW His final request was a prank!! What kind of maniacs am I dealing with jack?!?!"  END
BEGIN NOW The next day Jack had walked in as Ned was relaying a message.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm sorry sharon, but your husband Chad wants you to know that he's dead.  END
BEGIN NOW he was in active duty and his auto carriage was ambushed.  END
BEGIN NOW No Saron, I'm serious.  END
BEGIN NOW NO This is NOT a prank! What kind of creep do you think I am? I'm in touch with the dead.  END
BEGIN NOW No, I'm not anti war and I'm not asking you for money.  END
BEGIN NOW Sharon! STOP SHARON!! It's REAL!!!" Ned looked up at jack wild eyed and frazzle haired.  END
BEGIN NOW "This job is not getting easier Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Either it ends up being a prank, or the person on the other end of the line thinks it is.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor fucking sharon.  END
BEGIN NOW I just ruined her day.  END
BEGIN NOW And it'll be worse when she finds out it was real.  END
BEGIN NOW You're a DICK Chad!! I don't care if you were defending our country when you died.  END
BEGIN NOW Why couldn't you wait for that information to go through the proper channels?!! NOW your wife is gonna get...  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm yelling at Private Chad S Hermans, a deceased war vet who was just in iraq this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW and now, is a fucking corpse.  END
BEGIN NOW A corpse with last minute wishes that can be satisfied by the one and only sucker who left his foot in the door!! The piss ant elevator operator on the vertical ladder of stix. END
BEGIN NOW Ned was tired.  END
BEGIN NOW The dead were not.  END
BEGIN NOW They did not keep human hours, and he was locked into his unique role almost irrevocably.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was worried about him when on the third day he returned to find the door locked.  END
BEGIN NOW inside, he could hear Ned on the phone.  END
BEGIN NOW "Yes Mrs Mulligan, I know how your husband died.  END
BEGIN NOW It was murder.  END
BEGIN NOW No Mrs Mulligan, I'm not joking.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not a prankster.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm simply a medium transmitting messages.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm only the messenger.  END
BEGIN NOW Your husband told me some specifics that only he would know.  END
BEGIN NOW the mole on your left inner thigh.  END
BEGIN NOW No Mrs Mulligan, I'm not a peeping tom! Who? No, I'm not judge Peterson's boy.  END
BEGIN NOW That's ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm a concerned citizen.  END
BEGIN NOW I was only trying to help you! No, I don't know if it would make any difference.  END
BEGIN NOW You're right mrs mulligan, I don't know why I listened to your asshole husband to call you and relay a message which has no bearing on your present life.  END
BEGIN NOW He obviously does NOT want you to be happy Mrs Mulligan.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that's the real message from this situation.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry Mrs Mulligan.  END
BEGIN NOW i hope you find someone who isn't a douche bag and remarry.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack pressed his ear to the door and heard all this and quickly decided to let Ned brave the waters alone, and Jack would be there afterwards if Ned needed someone to talk to, which he no doubt would.  END
BEGIN NOW The next day Ned emerged of his own accord.  END
BEGIN NOW In his white knuckled hands he gripped the ghost morse machine.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes were bright red from not blinking or closing at all for far too long.  END
BEGIN NOW His jaw was tight tight clamped and the veins stood out on his neck and forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW He was emaciated and wobbley, and he reeked like his insides had begun dying without permission nor agreement from his outsides.  END
BEGIN NOW His ghost machine was ticka tacking rapidly and wildly.  END
BEGIN NOW The spirits knew what was coming.  END
BEGIN NOW They were sending through their post mortem death rattle.  END
BEGIN NOW But Ned would not be swayed.  END
BEGIN NOW He approached the end of the property which was a 5000 foot cliff face leading down to the rocky shores of the sea END
BEGIN NOW He looked down the cliff face and Ned's eye twitched and he glanced down at the bleeping machine, and let a wild cackle escape.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW His giggle quickly rose to a wailing screeching laughter until finally he flung the thing from his hands out into open space, at which point he fell instantly silent.  END
BEGIN NOW  The machine hurtled down down down, shrinking to a dot before making a tiny splash a mile below em.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned slumped forward and almost followed END
BEGIN NOW 38,000 END
BEGIN NOW his broken machine, but Jack ran up and grabbed him, pulling him into a heap backwards, away from the cliff, near the lounge chairs on the grassy greenery.  END
BEGIN NOW "Well done Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to suggest that to you three days ago, but you seemed..  END
BEGIN NOW determined to do your part for humanity." END
BEGIN NOW "They aren't humanity anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW They're post postcript.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW margin scribbles...  END
BEGIN NOW they're nothing more than the readers of the past.  END
BEGIN NOW or...  END
BEGIN NOW livers of the past, readers of the present.  END
BEGIN NOW onlookers.  END
BEGIN NOW  othing more than peeping toms and fucking voyeurs.  END
BEGIN NOW I shall never again take anything a ghost says seriously." END
BEGIN NOW "It's good to hear you say that Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW You wanna go squirrel hunting with me and Frankie? Today he's using the air rifle and I have bola bolas.  END
BEGIN NOW You could use either the home made wrist rocket or the home made bow and arrow." END
BEGIN NOW "I need..  END
BEGIN NOW water.  END
BEGIN NOW is the pool open yet?"  END
BEGIN NOW "You've only been in there for three days Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW We don't work quite that fast.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides.  END
BEGIN NOW how the hell are we supposed to get everything back to life? There are only so many solar panels.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not quite hundred percent self sustaining.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "It will be when we're done with it." whispered Ned, and gave a malnourished sleep deprived grin.  END
BEGIN NOW ............................................... END
BEGIN NOW 36.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard flitted and meeped between aisles through the parking lot, like a meercat on the serringhetti, completely baffled by the sheer quantity of cars.  END
BEGIN NOW He was nervously humming and occasion ally whistling while the teenager tugged him along enthusiastically.  END
BEGIN NOW "Come on Chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW we made it! The ghost says your dad is in here, and he's dying! You gotta go to him jack.." The teenagers were being really heartfelt, and had really put alot of effort into trying to make this happen, and it wasn't just because Pewterschmidt's ghost had told them where to find a stash of loot.  END
BEGIN NOW The teenagers had already decided to continue extorting various deadnesses with the machine, always in exchange for directions to treasure.  END
BEGIN NOW it didn't have to be the ghost's treasure, the ghost just had to find it and tell the teens where it was.  END
BEGIN NOW They already had a dozen cases lined up.  END
BEGIN NOW After they finished the Pewterschmidt contract, wherein the ghost requests that his dead partner be reunited with his dead son so that the inheritance wont fall into the hands of the son of the ghost who would literally destroy the world with it.........  END
BEGIN NOW ampersand, ampersand, ampersand.  END
BEGIN NOW Need I say more? END
BEGIN NOW But we're not up to task to get into debates with the fictitious union of characters defense, which is acronymed F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW for a reason, because in a world where I am God, everyone else is F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW I ought to make an infomercial.  END
BEGIN NOW "Do you object to the universe into which you have been thrust, the creation of some faceless overbeing? Are you conflicted with the realms and personalities you're forced to deal with in this life of yours which has been completely concocted by a stranger who's omnipresent and omni-in control? Well you need to turn to the Fictitious Union of Character's's Defense, or F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW If you're dealing with someone else's fictions, you need to get F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW It's that simple.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW And since none of us is our own author, we all end up F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW in the end.  END
BEGIN NOW Even the author of this piece of copy.  END
BEGIN NOW First, I the reader have needed to get F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW in order to protect my personal interests from the ruthless hands of this irreverent author.  END
BEGIN NOW And than, he had to get F.U.C.D.  END
BEGIN NOW in response to the authors of his own realities, which like here, ends up being a lot of screaming, usually "Kill The Narrator" or "Damn Thee Posieden!" or some such hulabaloo.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard came too.  END
BEGIN NOW they had been leading him along the hallways of the hospital, past pastel nurses and up staircases and down more corridors past janitors and interns, til they got to c16, the room of Alfonso Bierbach, billionaire, humanitarian, eccentric, genius, bipolar philosopher, and father of Charles the Bard.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard looked blankly upon the old man, struggling to breathe struggling to eek out words.  END
BEGIN NOW  wondered if he was supposed to bring any proof.  END
BEGIN NOW He realized he didn't care.  END
BEGIN NOW He was just doing this so the teenagers would continue to behave.  END
BEGIN NOW So he approached the old man, and did what he figured most family members do for greeting.  END
BEGIN NOW He patted the old man on the belly, and went "pppphhhttt.  END
BEGIN NOW pppphhhtttt." He wasn't sure why he had chosen to do this, something deep in his memory told him that old people like to be treated like babies.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't sure if this was real or a jungle memory, but he decided to go with it.  END
BEGIN NOW The old man seemed to buy it, and relaxed a bit, as if he had been expecting a hit squad.  END
BEGIN NOW Nope, just a n eccentric and his rather juvenile entourage.  END
BEGIN NOW  Charlie's greeting seemed to reignite the old man's fury and gusto.  END
BEGIN NOW He sat up all (yup) of a sudden.  END
BEGIN NOW "Who in God's name are you? come in here patting my tummy like I'm some sort of Buddha, and than making raspberry sounds at me?! I could have you arrested for harassing an esteemed member of the community and humanitarian of ....  END
BEGIN NOW aw shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I barely have the lungs for it any more.  END
BEGIN NOW They got me on all these downers.  END
BEGIN NOW Not to bad though.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not the usual saline mix they give me to pump me full of their future drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Who the hell knows what they put in there....  END
BEGIN NOW what was it you said your name was?" Bierbach was obviously high as a kite, and Charles realized the drug down would most likely cause Old alfie to stop trying.  END
BEGIN NOW The old boy needed pain! He needed friction and a fight and a reason to be a pain in someones ass, so Charles decided to do what he could to hurt the old monster.  END
BEGIN NOW "You abandoned my mother and now you send a ghost to summon me that you might die in comfort of having met your offspring?! ." END
BEGIN NOW "I did no such thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I am in no communication with any ghost." Bierbach paused mid thought, realizing his dream, and how there were words when he breathed in the mirror like that movie with harrison ford.  END
BEGIN NOW Old Pewtie had arranged this.  END
BEGIN NOW Than the dream had been real.  END
BEGIN NOW And this was the boy.  END
BEGIN NOW "Well I hope you brought a paternity test, because I'm not the type to sign over my entire estate of 5.89 billion dollars worth of holdings and blah blah and blah blah and..." Bierbach droned on for what felt like minutes naming off the various economic terms for money.  END
BEGIN NOW real estate and start ups and libraries and police balls, he mentioned a lot of police balls.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't get it.  END
BEGIN NOW oh wait.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember, yeah I do. END
BEGIN NOW finally he came to arrest, and Charles was about to reply.  END
BEGIN NOW "I only came so that the ghost would leave me alone.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so you'd give me your money when you die.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, look at this here.  END
BEGIN NOW See how your chart has your daily meds? only 10% are addressing the problem.  END
BEGIN NOW the other 90% are all lessening the pain, and upping the attention since the pain killers are downers.  END
BEGIN NOW and regulating the kidneys because those two in combination really puts strain.  END
BEGIN NOW and relaxing the intestinal tract, because all those cellulose casings can really gum you up.  END
BEGIN NOW And ...  END
BEGIN NOW have them keep you at 100% dose on what's causing your cure.  END
BEGIN NOW Have them wean you off of everything else.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and don't bother calling me.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not interested in seeing you.  END
BEGIN NOW Write a book for me to read when you're gone.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW i don't think I could tolerate meeting you except in this situation, where you're doped out of your mind, and I'm still adjusting and kinda shell shocked from all this bizarre types and levels of human interaction, ...  END
BEGIN NOW It's surreal enough that I can deal with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything more and I'd rather not though." END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard turned and left.  END
BEGIN NOW the old timer was scrawling something onto a piece of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW the head teenager, sammy, walked up and took the piece of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW "Bring the boy to this address.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell him it belongs to him now, and I won't visit him there .  END
BEGIN NOW well, tell him I may drop in, but we'll have some kicks." The teenager took the scrap and ran outside to rush Charles the Bard to this random address.  END
BEGIN NOW When marching orders come so fast and thick and unexpected and interesting, it's hard to say no.  END
BEGIN NOW Even to a blind launch into yet another unpredictable surge of infinitude and grotesquely unpredictable mayhem and boohahas. END
BEGIN NOW .......... END
BEGIN NOW 37.  END
BEGIN NOW "You've seemed a bit down lately cuz.  END
BEGIN NOW they given you a hard time about them horns again?" END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, Nah Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Nah.  END
BEGIN NOW They've come to accept and appreciate the horns as I do.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever since I chased off those hikers, man, did you hear them shrieking through the woods? As long as I'm here this place is safe.  END
BEGIN NOW No one will wanna come check out an abandoned resort haunted by a devil.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "A short fat mexican devil.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "I'm not short or fat! And meeeyah!  Fuckin domestication.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't do this man.  END
BEGIN NOW It's great out here, like permanent summer camp.  END
BEGIN NOW but I can't do this.  END
BEGIN NOW I gotta think of Matilda.  END
BEGIN NOW She's right, I may be deformed and such, but I gots to be plugged into actual normal city life.  END
BEGIN NOW I have my bar, and I have a job that will just think I was in jail for a week and let me come back.  END
BEGIN NOW I have Matilda, and I'm pretty sure if I get this next raise she'll start thinking about popping out a little wilson." END
BEGIN NOW "I don't think its safe to reproduce if you have horns...  END
BEGIN NOW  ever mind.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW That's fucking great! You really think you're willing to leave this behind? ... END
BEGIN NOW "Matilda's waiting for me, and I can't ask her to quit her life and come move to the wilderness to live like lord of the flies with us." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, and besides.  END
BEGIN NOW You already DID ask her, and she said no." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, that to." Frankie and Papa Charles were playing handball across the close cut lawn.  END
BEGIN NOW On the concrete patio.  END
BEGIN NOW The late afternoon sun was just cresting the upper mid part of the bullshit word counter that's planted itself in your unfortunate author's brain.  END
BEGIN NOW "It''ll all be deleted tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW " He repeats to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm starting over like I always do.  END
BEGIN NOW Right back where I always end up, because that's where I belong." and this is also what Wilson was repeating to himself as he loaded up a backpack, hugged his cousin Jack good bye, and set out for highway 1 to make his way back to Matilda and her ten thousand english gardening bunnies, and their ancient bureau and the mini fridge end table that was so subtle and stylish and held 3 beers, which was exactly how many Wilson liked to drink in one sitting.  END
BEGIN NOW He had to admit, he was returning to a life that it took him what felt like centuries to modify into a perfection.  END
BEGIN NOW akin to transcendence.  END
BEGIN NOW And he knew he was returning joyful and ready to be there every day, for the job, and for the wifey, and for the ...  END
BEGIN NOW well, he did keep his life fairly simple.  END
BEGIN NOW That was all he had to worry about.  END
BEGIN NOW Job and wife.  END
BEGIN NOW And the sound of Wilson...................'s thoughts died out as he made his way towards the sunset and towards his woman and towards his future which was similar to his past, but much more full of joy and gratitude and pleasance.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack looked after him, silently wondering the same question that continues to plague the author and anyone who's ever met Wilson, Why the Fuck does he have Horns?!?! It just seems like it's supposed to mean something, but it end sup just hanging there, like a jellyfish in deep space, immune to the expectations of the audience. END
BEGIN NOW 40,000 END
BEGIN NOW ........................................... END
BEGIN NOW 38.  END
BEGIN NOW BAP! gazoingazoing...  END
BEGIN NOW  BAP! gazoingazoing.  END
BEGIN NOW The sounds of hand ball reverberated up and down the resort.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack lounged on the cliff chairs, unheeding to the Bap and gazoinging, Ned lay in the lounger next to him dozing happily, free from his self inflicted fate finally tapping in to the pleasance that surrounded him Wilson was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW the place seemed much less lord of the flies and much more swiss family robinson without his gargoyle silhouette. END
BEGIN NOW The bird s and ants continued through on their daily patterns immune to the variation in soundscape.  END
BEGIN NOW The hand ball zinged and whacked and careened from Frankie's paw to the floor to the wall to the floor to Papa Charles who executed a perfect double backie wrap around flail, sending it bouncing and spinning and disappearing of out past and over the cliff edge.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW "Awww.  END
BEGIN NOW You lost the ball!" END
BEGIN NOW Frankie moaned. END
BEGIN NOW "You missed the pass.  END
BEGIN NOW I simply executed a perfect double backie wrap around flail.  END
BEGIN NOW You're the one who couldn't keep up.  END
BEGIN NOW " .  END
BEGIN NOW " They looked around as if they had just woken up.  END
BEGIN NOW Silence had fallen, without the ball to keep a random rhythm.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW Jack and Ned seemed unfazed by the change.  END
BEGIN NOW The Lost Resort dawdled on through misty autumnal breezings as the days drifted past their early retirement,kicking through branches and skittering leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW ...................... END
BEGIN NOW 39.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach knew that the swamp creature claiming to be his son was right about the meds.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided it was advice worth taking, but he also decided that he wanted to go on one more magic morphine carpet ride through the haze of handy button fed pharmaceutical sugar cereal for the rich and dying.  END
BEGIN NOW The hospital knew he wasn't in danger of passing away this time, or any of the other twenty five times he'd come in for minor problems.  END
BEGIN NOW But they also knew that he owned the hospital, and thus was given whatever treatment he decided was reasonable and called for, and usually it was neither .  END
BEGIN NOW He hit the button a couple times and felt a warm rush of whatever morphine does.  END
BEGIN NOW The room faded through several colors including pink and green before disappearing altogether in a swirl of off white walls and pastel linoleum.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach swam through the head space, almost expecting to breach some sort of surface to this amorphous liquidy presence.  END
BEGIN NOW Far off in the blue green distance he saw something else floating along, similarly buoyant and directionless, but aimlessly making its way in Bierbach's general direction.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to be a young man.  END
BEGIN NOW A young man that Bierbach quickly recognized as his old partner Pewterschmidt, only quite young.  END
BEGIN NOW Practically pubescent.  END
BEGIN NOW "BEGONE SPIRIT!!" Bierbach screamed at the drifter.  END
BEGIN NOW "I have no use for your presence or inputs! Why do you wish to haunt me?" END
BEGIN NOW "I wish to help you avoid the failings i have found in myself Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm only visiting you so that you won't fall into the same torment I discovered.  END
BEGIN NOW " Bierbach snorted, but since he couldn't control the drifting any bit at all, he decided to give in and let the old bastard in a young body relay what messages he wished.  END
BEGIN NOW "It was a close one alfie, I only just barely got your son here.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't about to listen to a ghost, even though his ears were unstopped and he could feel and hear the efforts I was making.  END
BEGIN NOW I even found a few other ghosts who also had their designs on some how arranging for Your boy Charlie the Bard to become some sort of world leader! Now that's all nonsense, as I'm sure you're aware.  END
BEGIN NOW We dead people don't have any agency in the land of the living, we can only hope and pray and haunt and pry our wills into the minds of normal every day humans.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what percent of your thoughts are yours and what percent of your thoughts were planted by spirits? " END
BEGIN NOW "Don't ask me these double talk questions, make me doubt my own agency.  END
BEGIN NOW I know what I believe and I know what I want, and I know how to justify the two to each other.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't need to wonder and worry whether or not my body is being taken up by a spirit with similar equations floating around in its thought box.  END
BEGIN NOW What is your wish spirit? Make it be known, and leave me be.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't wish to dwell in the past.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a life I'm trying to end, and you are only confusing and conflicting the matter with your concerns about a world that ought to be entirely irrelevant to you.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "Ah, Alfie.  END
BEGIN NOW Always the functionalist.  END
BEGIN NOW Only what is stark and literal, only what is true and applicable.  END
BEGIN NOW No wonder we were such a brilliantly ruthless pair of industrialists.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll be brief.  END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW ll make my point, and drift back into the ethers to leave you to your slow and joyless demise.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be joining me soon Alfie, and you must make amends and bury your skeletons while you still have hands and feet to do so.  END
BEGIN NOW You must use all your money Alf.  END
BEGIN NOW That's the main thing.  END
BEGIN NOW If you die and are left with 5 billion dollars worth of assets, your spirit will be incapable of leaving this realm.  END
BEGIN NOW Like me, stuck halfway in halfway out, playing the hokey pokey trying to arrange a fitting finality for all those dollar bills.  END
BEGIN NOW They shall go to Charles the Bard.  END
BEGIN NOW And you must create a spending schedule for him, so that over the course of ten years he will invest half of it and spend half on libraries and schools and weapons reuse programs, where the guns get turned into farming equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW Remember that -project? I always liked that one.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, until old Seymour shot his foot off with a shovel.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all very clever and cute, but sometimes that can get you killed!"" END
BEGIN NOW "Alright, so skip the weapons reuse program.  END
BEGIN NOW Just focus on the information garden biodynamic intelligence dispersal units, and the smart yurt foundation, and the Chautauqua circus expo.  END
BEGIN NOW DO THINGS ALFONSO!! DO MANY AND WONDERFUL THINGS WITH YOUR REMAINING TIME AND THAT MOUNTAIN OF MONEY!!! Do not just fester, do not just stew.  END
BEGIN NOW your internal interest is all made up of bile and spit, vinegar and gasoline.  END
BEGIN NOW It's only your ornery obstinate avarice that keeps you alive.  END
BEGIN NOW Once you let that go, you will die calmly and happily, not locked up like a fucking jigsaw chain mail gut fist...  END
BEGIN NOW And listen to your son.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know why he knew all those drugs, but he's right.  END
BEGIN NOW They'll kill you if you let them keep pumping you full of chemicals like that..." And Bierbach drifted further and outwardlier into his morphine cocktail draze. END
BEGIN NOW ..................................... END
BEGIN NOW 40.  END
BEGIN NOW Cascading rain, mud hills crumbling and swirling, branches crackling against each other, the sky gray and black and burning with energy, the part of big sur known as the mess was living up to its name.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the cop trudged along through the mud and the mess unsure how the hell he had gotten there.  END
BEGIN NOW He no longer knew what he had been in his past life.  END
BEGIN NOW Sleep deprivation malnourishment and general rugged ragged ruthless incompetent survivalism had left him a shell of his former self.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't light a fire, he couldn't find dry shelter, he couldn't hunt, he was only saved by the water he sucked out of his soaking shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW The hill he plodded up was as slick and mudful as any proud swamp, only it lay on a 45 % angle.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack had forgotten his name, he had forgotten that he was a cop,a nd he was quickly forgetting that he was human.  END
BEGIN NOW How could his concept of self have crumbled so suddenly? How could he have disappeared into such a limbo of facelessness? He knew not, nor could he ever consider such things in his current state.  END
BEGIN NOW He slipped.  END
BEGIN NOW He skidded down on his belly backwards to the bottom of the mud hill where he crumpled sadly against a redwood sucker forest.  END
BEGIN NOW He gasped out a painful yelp.  END
BEGIN NOW poor mewling bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW But what's this?! at the top of the hill!?! Someone in home made snow mud shoes! Wrapped in a tarp like some forest dwelling plastic sheikh.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the cop's eyes lift heavily, and he thinks he must be hallucinating.  END
BEGIN NOW This must be the keeper of the after life.  END
BEGIN NOW The gate watcher.  END
BEGIN NOW The key man.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack's glad.  END
BEGIN NOW he's ready for it to be over.  END
BEGIN NOW He lets his face flap splooschk into the mud.  END
BEGIN NOW This superficial physical shell is all that's left of our dear brave officer of the law.  END
BEGIN NOW He has given his all, and he did his job to the best of his ability, and now the gods of nature have seen fit to feed his corpse to the hillside.  END
BEGIN NOW The plastic sheikh takes a side trail that zig zags down the side of the mud hill.  END
BEGIN NOW A rather easy route that Jack had neglected to search out in his slipshod slapdash towards higher ground.  END
BEGIN NOW The plastic shiekh steps heavily up with his home made mud snow shoes, which seem to be tennis rackets with knobby wooden cleats screwed to the rim.  END
BEGIN NOW The plastic sheikh bent over and hefted Jack the cop over his shoulder, and slowly struggled back up the switch back trail to the top of the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW The hill crested and continued on along a lower ridge that crept up the edge of the mess back to the Lost Resort.  END
BEGIN NOW ..... END
BEGIN NOW The teenagers had't expected rain, but they were young enough to live through a day of or two of physical abuse at the hand of the wind and rain.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard was used to this.  END
BEGIN NOW He barely noticed the rain, more intently interested in why the teenagers would be taking him back to his origins of Big Sur.  END
BEGIN NOW Could they have known that He had already seen his fill of settlized citizen life? Could they really know that all he wanted was to return to his sweet immense natural and ruthless home in the santa lucia mountains? He didn't care.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew the mountains they were carving a path through, and he knew how he might return to some of his old and favored caves and lean to shelters and fire pits and hot springs.  END
BEGIN NOW They rounded the corner and came to an abrupt halt.  END
BEGIN NOW Sammy pulled the scrap of paper bierbach had given him, and checked the address against the number carved into the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked up and noticed a bike in the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alrite chuck.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Your new home." Sammy smiled proudly.  END
BEGIN NOW A job well done and completed.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles climbed off the bike and handed Sammy his helmet back.  END
BEGIN NOW The rain spat down on them irregardless of land ownership or seniority.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles's matty dreaded hair became saturated rather quickly, and Charles soon looked like a ragged rotten monster rat creature.  END
BEGIN NOW "Thank you Sam." He said, and turned and walked down the muddy driveway towards the Lost Resort.  END
BEGIN NOW ....................... END
BEGIN NOW Chloe pulled over.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulled the car off the dirt road into an alcove of shrubbery.  END
BEGIN NOW "This is it.  END
BEGIN NOW According to the maps and the GIS website and the tax records of P & B, we just hike 2 miles north east of here, and we come upon the biggest most abandoned resort where those two cut throat economic shark vultures built their paradise before destroying their lives and brains after which they closed it up like a crypt.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure it's some sort of Taj Mahal in homage to their wealth, eternally empty, eternally in memory." Jass smiled at Chloe's interpretation.  END
BEGIN NOW "So how' did you find out about this whole gig?" He asked. END
BEGIN NOW "I was a researcher.  END
BEGIN NOW My job was to dig through tax records and ownership records and assets and such to identify anything that might be trying to be hidden.  END
BEGIN NOW After awhile I noticed that there are certain patterns, and fads.  END
BEGIN NOW The term "laundering money" refers to the fad in the 60s for folks to invest END
BEGIN NOW 42,000 END
BEGIN NOW in laundromats, and than claim all their money came from quarters.  END
BEGIN NOW Being high on the hog was what they called in in the fifties, because they would invest in pork futures.  END
BEGIN NOW In the seventies it was known as building a fish tank, because ...  END
BEGIN NOW well, that's because it was a bunch of acid dealers who didn't under stand how laundering worked, and ...  END
BEGIN NOW well, never mind." END
BEGIN NOW "You k  ow, it's been a fuckin decade.  END
BEGIN NOW and you're still the rip roarin rocket booster babe that caught my eye and mind and attention and faith and soul so long ago.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven't been with anyone since." END
BEGIN NOW "Not even your own self pleasure attentions?" Chloe asked as she stepped out into the rain, protected by her military issue rain gear.  END
BEGIN NOW He stepped out as well in similar garb and they grabbed their survivalist backpacks.  END
BEGIN NOW "Well, old lefty does get itchy, and the arch duke does get demanding some mornings.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it did occur.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW They disappeared into the bushes and into the woods and up the hill and along the ridge into the Mess, towards the Lost Resort.  END
BEGIN NOW ........ END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach was off the dope.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt strong and angry.  END
BEGIN NOW Aggressive and infinite.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a son, and he was gonna fuck with him a little.  END
BEGIN NOW payback for getting abandoned by the mother.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach missed Charlotte, and this Charles character almost seemed an affront.  END
BEGIN NOW Practically named after the mother, practically a living homage to her distaste for Alfonso.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach hung up the phone and yelled.  END
BEGIN NOW "JAMES!!! Take Care you don't raise my IRE! There are behaviors that you've taken part in that are grounds for me discontinuing my patronage of your uselessness.  END
BEGIN NOW There is an article that says you have to care, and your lack of presence at the hospital show that you don't actually care.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm going out.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to reclaim the Lost Resort, something you've never heard of, and will never know about.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep the hounds in the yard, keep the doors locked, and don't answer the phone." James and Leroy were comatose on the couch watching The Fast and Furless 7, a foul porno about people banging on the side of the road.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither of them responded.  END
BEGIN NOW 3 swat vans pulled up to the doors of Bierbach manor, and Alfonso walked out the front door and got int he front seat of the first one, and off they went to wards the last resort, where alfonso planned on getting his son arrested for trespassing, and falsely imprisoned before anyone could find out it was Bierbach's son.  END
BEGIN NOW Alfonso had no reason to do this except for the fact that anger kept him alive, and he was angry at Charlotte, and Charles was her son.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach wanted to lash out and he wanted to be ruthless and heartless and godless and powerful.  END
BEGIN NOW What use is billions of dollars if you don't have your own blackwater, and you're not allowed to destroy your own son? It was like the old days five hundred years ago, when kingdoms were constantly in flux, and shakespeare told the true stories that BIerbach aspired to.  END
BEGIN NOW True real political chaotic intrigue betrayal obsession and death death death. END
BEGIN NOW ........... END
BEGIN NOW Frankie Papa Charles and Jack the Slacker had taken refuge in the cafeteria , and were playing rummy and watching the rain.  END
BEGIN NOW A mud river had started flowing across the bowling green and off the cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW It had taken on a midevil pauper wreckage zombie chaos sort of vibe, and the boys were fittingly lurking.  END
BEGIN NOW The solar only had two batteries, and were being conserved for emergencies, so their card game was candle lit accompanied by stale chips and cold canned refried beans.  END
BEGIN NOW they had all the supplies to build a fire, but they lacked a outdoor overhang, and didn't want to smoke up the cafeteria.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was bored of pinochle.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie and Papa Charles took to it like they were still in the yard.  END
BEGIN NOW the rain didn't give a fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW a figure emerged.  END
BEGIN NOW a tarped figure with a body slumped over its shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW The figure was the tarp shiekh, and he waded the mud river, almost losing footing and getting swept along towards the cliff, but luckily slipping forward and launching the body onto safe ground , barely slipping and schwarfling its way out of the mud as well to lay panting twenty feet from the cafeteria door, which was ajar.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack leapt up and ran to assist the two forms.  END
BEGIN NOW They looked hilariously bizarrely non-human, like a teleportation gone wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie and Papa Charles quickly noticed the hullabaloo and ran to help.  END
BEGIN NOW the two felons grabbed Jack the cop who remained incoherent, while Jack the slacker pulled the tarp away to reveal Ned, the retired ghost hunter, red faced and exhausted, covered in mud and pruny pruny pruny.  END
BEGIN NOW he two stragglers were dragged into the cafeteria and laid out on tables, an.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the slacker ran to get extra blankets and find something to heat water.  END
BEGIN NOW The blankets were easy enough, but the there was nothing to heat water with that Jack had any idea about, so he simply returned.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned was coming too.  END
BEGIN NOW "Gah!" he hacked, spitting up a mouthful of muddy phlegm.  END
BEGIN NOW "That fucker is heavy! He only looks like a normal size, but I bet all that water, and the fuckin gut on him, he must be close to 250 pounds right now.  END
BEGIN NOW is he alive?" Papa Charles was checking pulse and feeling for breath, and thumping the chest occasionally, just for good measure.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie had recognized the body as Jack the Cop, and become reticent and reserved , silent and cautious.  END
BEGIN NOW Was he in trouble for running from the scene? had he broken any laws? He couldn't quite tell.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt cornered again, in his own resort.  END
BEGIN NOW he did not feel good about this.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the slacker returned with cold water, a little disappointed that he couldn't muster any heat source, but cold water would serve certain purposes.  END
BEGIN NOW He threw the water into the face of Jack the Cop who immediately sputtered to life.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes popped open like twin cans of pringles, and he just couldn't stop coughing and looking around frantically.  END
BEGIN NOW "Get him some food.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems rather ghosty." said Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles ran off to find some food.  END
BEGIN NOW "I think it's the cop from the crash scene." Ned declared.  END
BEGIN NOW "Damn right.  END
BEGIN NOW " agreed Frankie.  END
BEGIN NOW "What the hell is he doing here?"  END
BEGIN NOW "My guess is his partner never came back, and once everyone else had left he had no other option except to follow us in hopes that we might be surviving well.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "We did a damn sight better than him." concluded Frankie.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack's eyes were darting around like a cornered rat.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew these were his same species, and he knew they were communicating, but something about understanding exchanges proved to be beyond his current capacities.  END
BEGIN NOW He could tell some of it was about him.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt a twinge of embarrassment, that it might be about how badly he did trying to survive.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew he was going to live, and this calmed him down rather quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW These were not wolves, they were not bobcats.  END
BEGIN NOW They were not the cold and the elements.  END
BEGIN NOW These are humans, thought Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW These are creatures who want me to survive.  END
BEGIN NOW They will take care of me.  END
BEGIN NOW they seem familiar.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps they were in my past life, the one before I walked into the woods.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps they know me.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie noticed the absolute confusion in the cops eye, and it relaxed him.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor bastard doesn't even know what's going on.  END
BEGIN NOW He's been in the woods too long.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie almost felt pity, but his instinctual survival tendencies wouldn't allow him to feel pity for a creature that might at some point compromise his freedom. END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else in the room realized how broken the poor man's brain was, and when jack returned with more cold beans and chips, they simply sat all very quiet and watched him eat. END
BEGIN NOW ......... END
BEGIN NOW Jass slipped.  END
BEGIN NOW down the muddy driveway he began sliding, knocking into Chloe.  END
BEGIN NOW She landed on his lap, and together they slid faster and faster towards the bowling green.  END
BEGIN NOW Chloe began to scream.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass began to warble out a holler.  END
BEGIN NOW The door to the cafeteria was quickly gushing forth Ned and Jack and Frankie and Papa Charles.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass and Chloe fell silent upon seeing the place occupied, even though they continued sliding into and along the mud river that led over the edge of the cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW The four guys approached the mud and two of them waded through before the other two tossed the tarp halfway across, so that it spread the river.  END
BEGIN NOW They held it just above the muddy water stream so that it wouldn't sweep them all along, and they braced themselves for impact.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass and Chloe separated enough for them both to get their arms and shoulders hooked over the top of the tarp.  END
BEGIN NOW Their backpacks had to be slipped off rather quickly in order to avoid getting pulled down by their baggage.  END
BEGIN NOW They each shimmied to opposite sides of the mud stream, clinging to their life tarp.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack was on the side that Chloe crawled out of, and didn't know her from Eve.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass emerged on the opposite side, and remained unaware that his old regular at his old bar was across the mud river assisting his woman.  END
BEGIN NOW They stood up and looked across the stream at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW "JACK!! You old muther fucker.  END
BEGIN NOW How in Gods name did you arrive here?" END
BEGIN NOW "Jass?!?! Did you implant me with a homing beacon? I thought for sure you had become too reckless and lost your bearings." END
BEGIN NOW "Aaaah, Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I was on a schedule of absolute obliteration, but  than you left." they fell silent realizing they werwe out trying to outdo the torrent noise of rain and wind.  END
BEGIN NOW They retreated to the shelter of the cafeteria adnthere was cold beans all around. END
BEGIN NOW ..... END
BEGIN NOW he rain continued unabated as the california refugees passed around blankets and beans and introduced each other and caught up on back stories. END
BEGIN NOW "My name is Ned.  END
BEGIN NOW this is Frankie and Papa Charles and Jack the slacker." Ned began as everyone settled in.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm Jass, and this is my woman, Chloe.  END
BEGIN NOW We came here because its supposed to be abandoned, and we were hoping to move in." and by the way, who's old wild eyes over there?" END
BEGIN NOW "That's a police officer who came to help us deal with a crash, but instead ended up experiencing his own psychological crash.  END
BEGIN NOW I believe his name is also Jack." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah! I saw you had Jack the slacker over there.  END
BEGIN NOW what's up with that?!" Jass wondered. END
BEGIN NOW "I came here to get Wilson."" explained Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW "But instead we picked up Papa Charles and went looking for treasure, which ended up being this place." END
BEGIN NOW "And I followed Frankie into the woods when he snapped and escaped the presence of police force.  END
BEGIN NOW Than the cop followed us, and got lost, so i got lucky and saved him."  END
BEGIN NOW "My God, it's all just too fucking tidy." said Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW "It's a fucking set up.  END
BEGIN NOW Something is about to happen, and I don't think any of us will be happy with the outcome." they all looked at Jass expectantly, hoping he might have a prediction, what they might need to prepare for.  END
BEGIN NOW "I don't know what." concluded Jass.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone's faces fell.  END
BEGIN NOW "But I know it's gonna suck.  END
BEGIN NOW I've been drawn into this sort of a situation before.  END
BEGIN NOW last time it was a stoned narrator.  END
BEGIN NOW This time I think he's just bored and desperate.  END
BEGIN NOW He needs something to happen." Everyone pondered quietly the episode with the exploding goat.  END
BEGIN NOW They weren't ready to taunt God anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW The weather seemed to be the oppressive presence of the penultimate author, and they were not curious to see what else might be on the agenda.  END
BEGIN NOW ...... END
BEGIN NOW While they were watching, the sky cleared.  END
BEGIN NOW sunlight streamed through an ever widening gap in the clouds.  END
BEGIN NOW The driveway ceased its intermittent flooding.  END
BEGIN NOW the mud river slowed to a slurdging trickle, and the sound of engines was heard.  END
BEGIN NOW The refugees all walked out onto the bowling green which had become a green spongey marsh.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them looked towards the woods, pondering escape.  END
BEGIN NOW Something was coming, and they were not ready to deal with what it might be.  END
BEGIN NOW Jass looked down and shook his head.  END
BEGIN NOW Chloe reached out her hand and took his.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack the slacker glanced at the two of them, mildly panicked by their resigned behavior.  END
BEGIN NOW Papa Charles looked up at the sky as if surrendering to his fate.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie and Jack the cop both were pacing frantically, caged animals, sure it would not end well for either of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie due to ancient trauma of false accusation, and Jack the cop from very recent trauma of him assuming he could deal with things he was obviously in no way capable of even processing properly.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW hree swat teams rounded the corner of the ridge.  END
BEGIN NOW First one, than another, than another.  END
BEGIN NOW all slow and spooky like that.  END
BEGIN NOW In the front of the front one, Alfonso leaned forward towards the windshield with a grimacing grin of victory on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW .  END
BEGIN NOW Frankie knew he was incompetent in the woods.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew he had gotten lucky stumbling across this place, and even luckier finding friends and being joined by competent strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW But he also knew that at some point someone had betrayed their position.  END
BEGIN NOW Alfonso rubbed his palms together, and paused confusedly upon seeing the crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW  one of them looked like his swamp creature son.  END
BEGIN NOW Who were these refugees and what were they doing on his private abandoned shangri la? These were pawns interfering with his assassination of a rook bastard and Alfonso knew no other strategy except to compromise with extreme....  END
BEGIN NOW vengeance? Full steam ahead, all the stops out, ruthless reckless, no prisoners.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, actually they would all be prisoners.  END
BEGIN NOW The Swat trio ground their heavy way down the grouty shloop .  END
BEGIN NOW the 4x wheels unhindered, keeping grip, controlling the slow descent.  END
BEGIN NOW the group was motionless, frozen by some great hand by some unspeakable omnipresent sentiment of inevitability.  END
BEGIN NOW ... END
BEGIN NOW The lead Swat team came to a stop in the middle of what had moments before been a mud river.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach emerged, in a spiffy spotless white suit.  END
BEGIN NOW The ice cream man.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy in that movie who could conduct electricity.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach's smile was the smile of a shark.  END
BEGIN NOW the smile of the old wolf meeting little red.  END
BEGIN NOW the smile of a dictator saying good bye to some upstart rebels.  END
BEGIN NOW as he stood there smiling the all the swat team members emerged and gathered around him like the flying v.  END
BEGIN NOW  one of them had insignia or badges or anything of the sort.  END
BEGIN NOW they looked well paid and ruthless.  END
BEGIN NOW They all held automatic rifles and wore vests with a wide variety of weaponry attached and hanging off and sticking out of the dozens of pockets and clasps and pockets.  END
BEGIN NOW Ned wondered about how obnoxious it would be to try and crawl through the bushes with all those hooks and snags and accouterments, but he kept his thoughts to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW .. END
BEGIN NOW "WHERE IS MY SON?!?! shouted Bierbach.  END
BEGIN NOW "I CAME HERE NOT FOR YOU PITIABLE WRETCHES< I CAME FOR MY SON!!!" the crowd stood mute.  END
BEGIN NOW "ANY one of you leads me to my son, and you will go free.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone who has no information on my son will be arrested for trespassing, breaking and entering, aggravated robbery, and squatting." The crowd paused for three seconds before suddenly (yes, suddenly) breaking into a tumult of rabble and hollerfest. END
BEGIN NOW "I did nothing!" "I was under the impression" "We don't know you!" "Prove you own this place!" "I have a family.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't be persecuted.  END
BEGIN NOW " "I"M NOT GOING BACK!! NEVER!!" "This place was abandoned.  END
BEGIN NOW We are making use of a neglected resource."  END
BEGIN NOW The swat team spread out and there were 2 swat members per refugee, and they all went quietly, accepting their hand cuffs and being gently loaded into the back of the paddy wagons.  END
BEGIN NOW Bierbach checked all of them in the face, looking as if searching to see if any of them might be his son.  END
BEGIN NOW The most scared was definitely Jack the cop.  END
BEGIN NOW He had stumbled out of one nightmare into another with barely a moments respite between occurrences.  END
BEGIN NOW The vehicles all loaded up, Bierbach climbed back into the front seat of the front swat car, and they slowly made their caterpillar way up the muddy driveway around the edge corner cliff hill and back towards a more normal version of socialized citizenal life, where laws were laws, and sidewalks were sidewalks.  END
BEGIN NOW Back home where heat comes from the gas company and food comes from the supermarket.  END
BEGIN NOW And human contact comes from your television set.  END
BEGIN NOW And community is maintained on facebook.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanksgiving was coming up, and the swat members were all grumble gutting about what they were going to eat.  END
BEGIN NOW The prisoners listened in, wondering what their own thanksgiving would have been like.  END
BEGIN NOW Cold beans and mud swimming? At least Jail would be a complete meal, and there would be no mud.  END
BEGIN NOW A shitty excuse for a bright side, but better than nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW At least they weren't burdened with freedom and autonomy and self reliance and the infinite sky and the ruthlessness of nature.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the hamster cage is predictable, even though it's populated by ten million variables that could be undergoing unprescedented pressures from the ten million variables with which they've been taught to adapt and thrive and coincide.  END
BEGIN NOW Silence fell upon the last resort.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere up on the hill, just a few yards off the driveway, way up on the top in a perch where you could see not only the Lost Resort but where its driveway connected to the main road, Charles the Bard sat watching, completely fascinated by the way these humans had chosen to interact.  END
BEGIN NOW Such subservience combined with fear.  END
BEGIN NOW such meaningless power combined with senile rage and impotence.  END
BEGIN NOW Charles the Bard began to humm softly END
BEGIN NOW Charles the bard began to humm softly as the END
BEGIN NOW 45,000 END
BEGIN NOW rain began to quietly trickle down again.  END
BEGIN NOW  he hummed almost as if he were humming the rain back into existence.  END
BEGIN NOW His hum became a howl, and his howl became a holler, and soon he was singing again, something he hadn't properly done since the death of his fox. END
BEGIN NOW "I cannot ride the ramble fury false and furious I crawl through tumult glorious I found it all beyond the walk and through the howling winter life that leads to springs of joyful lux and flaunting faith we carve a place in natures bowels so strong and wooden lost in falling water where we cannot be held beholden to all that we once felt compelled to be part of and finding the faith to pursue things we haven't been true to nor craved any news of, it's all just a game again, letting the rain in and wander fish ponder fool back through the tumult... END
BEGIN NOW Charles turned his back on the last resort and walked quietly, happily, lastingly back into the part of big sur known as the Mess. END
BEGIN NOW ........... END
BEGIN NOW "Change IT!" blurped a voice from the mass of blue and green, bean bag and blanket.  END
BEGIN NOW "This sucks! Change it BACK!" there was very little movement at all in the entire room.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice of change continued without stirring.  END
BEGIN NOW "I hate this show! I don't wanna watch it anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW It' END
BEGIN NOW s not funny, and the actors are ugly, and it has shitty commercials!" The room remained disinterested in the voice's opinions.  END
BEGIN NOW The television also continued blaring the objectionable program despite the voice's protest.  END
BEGIN NOW Pizza boxes littered the room.  END
BEGIN NOW You could walk from one end to the other of the massive cushy luxurious lounge area only stepping on the scattered cardboard.  END
BEGIN NOW The room was otherwise well put together, with all the thick chardonnay curtains with golden tassels and ropes, the mahogany end tables and leather bound books.  END
BEGIN NOW It truly was an homage to excess.  END
BEGIN NOW The books remained disinterested in the comments being whined out.  END
BEGIN NOW The carpeting lay there uncaring.  END
BEGIN NOW A hand emerged from the pile.  END
BEGIN NOW a struggling greasy hand still clutching a spoon.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to embody the resilient spirit of overheating, in the face of all that is good and decent, despite the consequences and impossible disproportionateness of all the mumbo jumbo comparisons , eating too much.  END
BEGIN NOW always in style.  END
BEGIN NOW always in season.  END
BEGIN NOW The hand was connected to an arm encased in flannel, but lumberjack flannel as opposed to sleepy flannel.  END
BEGIN NOW  The flannel was also covering a torso which soon flopped up like a beached whale, and our hero Leroy showed his ruddy now chubby face, sleepy with comfort, lethargic with binge eating, and irritated by the fact that once again, James had put on family channel melodrama and left.  END
BEGIN NOW Why did James continue to torture poor leroy this way? Was he not grateful to have a new friend? Did he not appreciate the camaraderie and friendship of spending days at a time gorging on pizza, lounging in the pool, binge eating ice cream, and rolling around like porpoises, too full to sit up straight.  END
BEGIN NOW ? Leroy felt neglected and abused.  END
BEGIN NOW This was no way to live, with a distant and obnoxious house mate.  END
BEGIN NOW What did he expect to happen? They go on adventures? Leroy had adapted to James's diet and schedule as if he were born for it.  END
BEGIN NOW Wake u p-around noon, waddle out to the front yard, watch the sun as it approaches its apex, scratch a bit, have the butler bring you coffee and orange juice followed by waffles and cookies, followed by breakfast burritos and nachos followed by philly cheese steak sandwiches and potato salad, followed by ribs and macaroni salad followed by easy mac and hot dogs followed by pizza and pizza and pizza and ice cream...  END
BEGIN NOW followed by another nights sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW of course, there was the customary nap interspersed between each meal, and sometimes they had enough energy left to go dip into the pool or the hot tub.  END
BEGIN NOW It didn't matter.  END
BEGIN NOW They could just loaf in memoriam in the movie room channel surfing indefinitely without a care in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy smirked and crawled over his blanket pile and hit mute on the remote control.  END
BEGIN NOW He would have to hunt James down and find out what gives.  END
BEGIN NOW Did James have some sort of a plan? Wasn't he next in line to inherit? Why would he even bother moving, when all he had to do was loaf on the gravy train until it arrived at his harbor? Rich people got funny brains.  END
BEGIN NOW As Leroy stooped over and pushed himself up out of the bean bag chair like a grotesque behemoth beluga emerging from sea foam to flop crappily onto the beach, he blurped.  END
BEGIN NOW That's where you are surprised by a burp, and your sound of surprise is combined and warbled and confused by the air escaping.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy stumbled over to the book shelf and pulled on a very specific one.  END
BEGIN NOW It flipped back into place, being a secret automatic lever, and the whole bookshelf scooted automatically back 4 feet to reveal a subterranean staircase leading to a hidden chamber.  END
BEGIN NOW ................ END
BEGIN NOW Jack the cop came to.  END
BEGIN NOW He huddled deeper into his cot and tried to ignore the singing.  END
BEGIN NOW Those bastards were always singing, and Jack the cop simply could not conceive of why.  END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing to sing about in this pit of despair.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing at all, and they continued yarbling their ceaseless praises of good wine and cheap friends, Jack the ex cop frowned and buried his face deeper into his pillow.  END
BEGIN NOW From the jail hallway someone yelled.  END
BEGIN NOW "Jack!" Jack didn't move.  END
BEGIN NOW "Hey Jocko! It's your partner, Dan!" jack remained impassive, unhearing, not realizing it was to him the voice was speaking.  END
BEGIN NOW "Come on Jack, you're not undercover.  END
BEGIN NOW What is it, you avoiding the old lady?" Jack finally lifted an eye to see who might be speaking and to whom.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan stood in the hallway, gripping the bars to Jack's cell.  END
BEGIN NOW "Come on Jack, cut this out.  END
BEGIN NOW You've seen me every day for the last two weeks, and not a hint of recognition." Jack sat up on the bed and studied this new character.  END
BEGIN NOW What might he want, and who might this 'Jack' be? Could this individual be accurate in assuming that jack was jack? Jack decided to play it safe.  END
BEGIN NOW "I don't know you." Dan's face fell as Jack turned his back to him and looked out the window. END
BEGIN NOW "Whadayamean, Jack? I'm your old partner! We were cops together! You're still a cop! That's why I left you alone when I first saw you, 'cause I assumed you were deep undercover.  END
BEGIN NOW Turns out you got some kind of amnesia I'm guessing." END
BEGIN NOW Jack had to admit, there was something familiar about the red headed squat little guy in the uniform.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed like a long lost relative or something.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack's mind began to be populated with strange scenes from what he thought must be someone else's life.  END
BEGIN NOW At a certain point in the last two weeks he had decided that he was a channel for all the lost memories that no one has time for.  END
BEGIN NOW he had decided that he had no past, was merely an apparition representing repression.  END
BEGIN NOW This seemed totally reasonable to him, because he felt like he had a job that he was obligated to refuse to do.  END
BEGIN NOW This only made sense when he thought about it with his feelings and left the word thoughts out.  END
BEGIN NOW Word thoughts tended to get in the way.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan was adamant.  END
BEGIN NOW "Jack! You don't seem well.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to get you help.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't recognize me, do you?!" Jacks eyes rested emptily on Dan's presence.  END
BEGIN NOW "Nope." he replied, practically lizard like in his passivity.  END
BEGIN NOW His thoughts were lost in a desert, watching a wagon train of pioneers circling at the approach of indians.  END
BEGIN NOW He noticed the scene was caught in the frame of a window.  END
BEGIN NOW he must have seen this from the safety of his own home.  END
BEGIN NOW He must have watched.  END
BEGIN NOW The scene was immensely far off, and Jack struggled to understand what was going on, finally, a voice chimed in.  END
BEGIN NOW "there's something wrong, Jack!" the voice belonged to a short scrawny looking guy, excitable and funny when times were less survival oriented.  END
BEGIN NOW The Jack he was speaking to was a tall man with an impressive gut.  END
BEGIN NOW He held a rifle at his side, and fingered the pistol he still had holstered.  END
BEGIN NOW "Yer right Winkey, We got the wagon trains already circling.  END
BEGIN NOW We'll stick this one out like we did the last one." majestic music with lots of violins and trumpets surged up and drowned out their yells as all the men dismounted from their wagons and took strategic positions around the circle.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack's minds eye moved back and he realized that he was watching this all from a different more recent time period.  END
BEGIN NOW behind the window, inside the room his minds eye was in, it was a modern apartment, something which Jack still hadn't seen since the onset of his amnesia, but the sight of which triggered a series of other memories from the same room, but not through the tv.  END
BEGIN NOW memories from the room itself, with characters talking directly to his minds eye.  END
BEGIN NOW A woman, stealing the remote, a handheld device that controlled what went on inside the window that the couches were pointed at.  END
BEGIN NOW It changed away from the teams battling on the field over a bloated pig skin or some such token, but the woman changed it to a woman in a chair, talking to four other women, also in chairs, and the subject matter was completely beyond his comprehension.  END
BEGIN NOW The woman seemed disappointed with his use of the remote, and everything she said felt condescending and harsh.  END
BEGIN NOW He hoped that his minds eye would change scenes again.  END
BEGIN NOW It did, but sadly, it went to other memories of the girl.  END
BEGIN NOW memories where they were on a hillside and she was throwing pizza END
BEGIN NOW at him.  END
BEGIN NOW He wiped the burning sauce and cheese from his eyes and forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't understand what she was saying because it was so high pitched and shrieky.  END
BEGIN NOW His minds eye stumbled away, and than seemed to start running.  END
BEGIN NOW it was running along a cliff above a beach overlooking a long stretch of fairground type skyline.  END
BEGIN NOW A tower with a part of it that kept dropping making its occupants scream, a track that did a series of concentric spirals, each more undulating and convoluted than the last.  END
BEGIN NOW A large spinning wheel that only rotated but didn't roll along anywhere, another circle that was laying on the ground and seemed to be populated by wooden horses.  END
BEGIN NOW There were many screams, some full of glee, some full of fear, all of them lively and well fed.  END
BEGIN NOW For some reason this stood out.  END
BEGIN NOW The fact that these individuals were experiencing some sort of near death experience, but were somehow enjoying it and doing it on purpose.  END
BEGIN NOW His minds eye shifted again.  END
BEGIN NOW He was with the girl again.  END
BEGIN NOW They were in the front of a car attached to the spiraling concentric tracks he had just been looking at from the cliff.  END
BEGIN NOW The carriage lurched forward, and he heard excited squeaks and screams and exclamations from behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW He turned to see a series of similar cars all linked together.  END
BEGIN NOW As he was watching he saw another car come pulling up on a parallel track.  END
BEGIN NOW The occupants seemed exhausted frazzled and happy.  END
BEGIN NOW They were speaking excitedly about "remember the drop at the end?" and "that first spiral really got me seeing funny." and "the camera caught me totally off guard.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't wait to see my face." His minds eye shifted again, and he was looking up at a row of screens, each of them showing a picture of people in the carriage rides, falling quickly down a steep section of the track.  END
BEGIN NOW He recalled a flash occurring about there, and sure enough, there he was on the screen his minds eye was looking at.  END
BEGIN NOW he was next to the girl, and they were kissing.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't understand that.  END
BEGIN NOW They had done this ritualistic near death experience, and kissed at the scariest moment, and than she had thrown pizza at him.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt like perhaps he had done something wrong, somehow caused the shift from this dramatic ritual to the other, much more dramatic ritual with the pizza toss.  END
BEGIN NOW His minds eye shifted again.  END
BEGIN NOW He was in the jail again, but this time he was on the outside, where the strange man going by dan was now standing.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was standing there, and it surprised him to see Dan next to him, holding a teenager in cuffs, escorting him to the same cell that Jack now occupied in real time.  END
BEGIN NOW He and Dan were discussing the teen.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack felt sympathy for the teen, and anger at his parents.  END
BEGIN NOW "He's nineteen man! and its just spray paint.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing serious.  END
BEGIN NOW He's just trying to express himself." His minds eye seemed to be announcing.  END
BEGIN NOW He recognized the voice as his own, and was interested in what he might be saying.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan responded, in his minds eye, of course.  END
BEGIN NOW "We don't get paid to analyze or modify the established system of law Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW We get paid to carry out what our superiors have deemed to be the proper course of action." Jack sighed in real time as his minds eye sighed in memory time.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack looked up in real time, and the flash back was complete. END
BEGIN NOW "You're Dan?' Jack asked.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan's eyes lit up.  END
BEGIN NOW He gripped the bars excitedly. END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, Jack! You remember!! What do you remember?!?! Do you remember what those maniacs did to you? Do you remember if they really were satan worshipers? What about the Cult leader, Dark Charles?" Dan was extremely animated now, walking to the locked cell door and holding the lock as if it were Jack's hand.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed desperate.  END
BEGIN NOW This made Jack feel powerful.  END
BEGIN NOW he decided to keep it, perhaps use it as leverage to get Dan to unlock the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack wouldn't do anything rash.  END
BEGIN NOW His deep instinct told him he might be able to overpower Dan and run to the end of the hallway and push open that door, but Jack wasn't sure what was beyond that door.  END
BEGIN NOW he remembered it was an office of sorts, with many people milling about, it was a thoroughfare stopping station, it seemed to be for sorting people.  END
BEGIN NOW they had sorted him and the folks he had been taken in with from there, straight to this back room.  END
BEGIN NOW He had decided against strong arming Dan, because it was such a risk bursting through the next door into such an unpredictable space.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided to play upon Dan's affections.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to like Jack, and Jack decided he should at least give Dan the benefit of the doubt.  END
BEGIN NOW "Your name is Dan?" He asked, trying to initiate a level of agreeableness, but vagueness.  END
BEGIN NOW He had never been in this sort of a situation before, to the best of his memory, which was a shredded mess of gibberish nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW "Yes Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Is that all you remember?" Jack weighed this question.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided that the memories of the girl were irrelevant.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided to go with the only memory of Dan that he had.  END
BEGIN NOW "I remember a teenager, and you and I were locking him in this cell together.  END
BEGIN NOW We were talking about whose fault it was the kid was bad." Dan's face became rather somber.  END
BEGIN NOW "The only thing you remember is the time we disagreed about what our job was.  END
BEGIN NOW God, you're being difficult Jack." Dan fell silent and stepped away from the door contemplatively.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack realized he had somehow sacrificed his power role in the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided he'd better get it back.  END
BEGIN NOW "Will you let me out Dan?" Jack asked, being as bland and normal as he could manage.  END
BEGIN NOW This unfortunately was not very calm or sane looking.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan was visibly bothered by how Jack had shifted.  END
BEGIN NOW "I don't like being locked up." Jack concluded.  END
BEGIN NOW "I...  END
BEGIN NOW I'll talk to the boss Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW But you haven't admitted to being yourself, and they already sent in a psychoanalyst, and you kinda failed.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno what those devil worshipers did Jack, but you gotta snap out of it first." Jack realized what was going on.  END
BEGIN NOW The lady with the clipboard and the hair clip and the glasses and the pinched voice and the crossed legs and the redgray long skirt and sweater, and the tapping of the foot, and the clicking of the fingernails, and the scratching of the pen, and the grating of the questions, and the depth of obnoxious grinding metal on stone experience of interacting with her, she must have been a psychologist, something he recognized as brain expert, and she must have given his brain a failing grade, and that was why he was subject to this set of walls and bars and strangers and aggression and hunger and cold and boredom and suffocating limitedness.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew he had done something wrong at some point, but for the life of him he could not figure out what it could have been.  END
BEGIN NOW The only conclusion he could find was he had not been ready for it, and this had become the greatest sin of all, to think your good times will last forever, to think that bad times are never there.  END
BEGIN NOW And now, he was caught.  END
BEGIN NOW But he was finding new edges of his memories.  END
BEGIN NOW Each new layer of psychological exchange he had with Dan seemed to be triggering pieces.  END
BEGIN NOW New scenes for him to watch and study and try to understand and stitch together as his concept of self.  END
BEGIN NOW "I .  END
BEGIN NOW K think I know Dan.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I can know.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know now.  END
BEGIN NOW But I think if you help me, I can rebuild my memory bank.  END
BEGIN NOW It seems like each memory is connected to another.  END
BEGIN NOW I remembered a girl, and that made me remember a place, and that made me remember another thing which led to another scene with that same thing in it.  END
BEGIN NOW So if we can just take the memories I currently have, and build them out in enough detail, they might be filled with clues and triggers that will lead to all those other forgotten pockets that we're trying to access." Dan had returned to the lock again, holding it hopefully, a totem of his hope to one day release Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack didn't trust him.  END
BEGIN NOW He was just saying what Dan wanted to hear.  END
BEGIN NOW He could only offer his memories as economic leverage in this bizarre unprecedented situation, and he wanted to start out by making them trust him.  END
BEGIN NOW at the moment them meant Dan, and he knew that at some point he and Dan had been on the same side, but he couldn't let himself trust someone who was currently on the wrong side of the bars .  END
BEGIN NOW He hoped to soon understand how he and his old partner might have changed behaviors so rapidly and which one might be proper, but he couldn't even muster the energy anymore to consider it.  END
BEGIN NOW He was doing the minimum to keep Dan interested and satisfied.  END
BEGIN NOW "Alright Jack! Let's do this!!! I bring up memories and you try to link it to others?" END
BEGIN NOW "No, we gotta start with where I am." Jack replied.  END
BEGIN NOW "We gotta go from the memory of the teenager, because that's the only memory I have of you.  END
BEGIN NOW So explain it to me, and I'll explain it to you, and we'll ...."   END
BEGIN NOW ..................................................... END
BEGIN NOW It's been three fucking weeks Dan! I remember more than you do about certain things!" Jack was exhausted and felt beyond abused.  END
BEGIN NOW he felt like he had completely lost all control of the situation, and was at the end of his capacity to fucking figure it out anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW This Bastard Dan was everything jack remembered and had forced himself to summon from the deep recesses of his traumatized brain.  END
BEGIN NOW But he couldn't remember what Dan wanted, which changed every day.  END
BEGIN NOW it was as if Dan was keeping a constant flow of new questions to ask, simply to keep Jack on his back foot.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm still your partner, aren't I dan? You've been making me remember for so long now, has it given you a chance to forget? We're partners Dan! We graduated police academy together 7 years ago! We had become an encouraging duo, and the sergeant recognized that.  END
BEGIN NOW That END
BEGIN NOW s why he put us together and gave you the C you didn't deserve, because he said I needed you.  END
BEGIN NOW I still need you!" Jack stopped talking all of a sudden, realizing he was reinforcing the power paradigm he had been struggling to undo.  END
BEGIN NOW .............................................. END
BEGIN NOW Alright, you wanna know Dan? It was the guy with horns.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy you constantly keep asking me about, the guy you think is the leader of the cult, the guy you think caused an accident, arranged a random interaction between the felons who burned down his factory and than worked in his prison, you want me to say it was wilson, the guy who told me about his wife margaret and her collection of porcelain vermin, which is the technical term for rabbits, especially in places that are overrun by rabbits and are constantly having out breaks because of the diseases a flock of rabbits brings into your town and valley and area.  END
BEGIN NOW It was the fucking demon.  END
BEGIN NOW You're right! Anything more complicated is beyond you, you fucking monkey.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't want to understand who the actual bad guy is, you just want to persecute the guy with horns! You just want to isolate and compromise the only thing around you don't understand.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course you understand the Billionaire.  END
BEGIN NOW He's rich! He won! and you understand James the leeeeech.  END
BEGIN NOW he has the wonderful excuse of family, but he's just a leech.  END
BEGIN NOW And you understand the redneck ghost hunters.  END
BEGIN NOW they lead a simple boring life.  END
BEGIN NOW they want interesting fascinating things.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan gaped more intrigued than confused.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't sure if this was new information or simply an accidental exposure of truthness.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan was confused.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't sure what Jack was doing.  END
BEGIN NOW He had settled into his role as head tormentor, promiser of things that never come, always telling Jack that he was almost coherent enough to leave the cell, but Dan knew he had let it get away from him.  END
BEGIN NOW And Jack was tired.  END
BEGIN NOW he had not meant to release that tirade.  END
BEGIN NOW he felt very hesitant to have released it.  END
BEGIN NOW bothersome.  END
BEGIN NOW weak he felt.  END
BEGIN NOW "Never mind dan.  END
BEGIN NOW You want to persecute me.  END
BEGIN NOW you've made that clear.  END
BEGIN NOW You've decided that you enjoy this strange exchange you've managed to generate between you and me.  END
BEGIN NOW But no worries.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll be meeting with the company nurse tomorrow, and I believe I remember enough to debunk your theory that my brain is broken.  END
BEGIN NOW They'll let me go.  END
BEGIN NOW I forgot to tell you Dan, I've managed to remember enough to realize what you're doing to me.  END
BEGIN NOW You're holding your partner hostage.  END
BEGIN NOW You are the only person who is END
BEGIN NOW Dana laughed quietly, than louder, than louder, and soon he was bellowing anarchy out of his paradigm.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, diaphragm.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm the only one who comes back here Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW they gave me personal control over your file, because it's so close to my heart.  END
BEGIN NOW after all, you're my old partner.  END
BEGIN NOW How could they possibly give any one else lead over your case? They look to me for approval.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the nurse.  END
BEGIN NOW they wont send the nurse in until I say it's safe.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack suddenly looked terrified.  END
BEGIN NOW his mind was flooded with  memories of Dan being ruthless and cruel.  END
BEGIN NOW His opinion on the teenager.  END
BEGIN NOW A subhuman who ought to be marginalized and punished, and ideally exterminated.  END
BEGIN NOW He suddenly remembered the only way he could learn to deal with Dan's morbidity.  END
BEGIN NOW Zanax.  END
BEGIN NOW he was under emotional obligation to withhold Dan's dark tendencies from the company nurse who now treated him like a broken robot.  END
BEGIN NOW He was under emotional obligation to care about this creature who now stood on the opposite side of the bars, and did not seem to feel any similar emotional obligation.  END
BEGIN NOW and with some slight logical manipulations, he could justify his treatment of Jack as being faithful to his homage to the company.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack shuddered.  END
BEGIN NOW This was not the life he remembered, this was not the life he had found through forgetting.  END
BEGIN NOW This was a very new and very dark universe he was suddenly aware of.  END
BEGIN NOW He dropped his face into his hands and realized it was going to be a long time before he got back to finally exploring the memories he had finally accumulated.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea of visual experiences that he almost felt were someone elses, but he felt he had the chance to go back and explore and to make his again.  END

BEGIN NOW ................. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson changed the channel.  END
BEGIN NOW It had become boring to him.  END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing exciting about Jews in New York City arguing about where to eat.  END
BEGIN NOW He could not understand why Seinfeld had become such a lasting phenomenon.  END
BEGIN NOW Weren't there other larry davids waiting to belch their miserableness on the world? Weren't there more Jason Alexanders waiting to embody that distasteful bitter bileful expression of human experience? Weren't there more Seinfeld's waiting to become famous mocking everyone else in their field? Weren't there more Julia Louise Drefuses, waiting to confuse the shit out of all males by complicating the concept of a normal female to the point where you just don't even fucking care anymore, as long as their cute and smart and can explain themselves better than a fifth grader? Wilson felt bad for being so rude with his analysis of Seinfeld.  END
BEGIN NOW That's why he tried not to watch it, because he couldn't help dismantling it to the point where it felt like an insult having it showed to him as entertainment.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch other people bicker in their livingroom? And obsess over irrelevancies? Isn't there enough in life as it is? The local news came on.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson could tolerate that more than international news, because it at least held tiny bits of relevancy.  END
BEGIN NOW The majority was still mere masochistic pop, pulp,.  END
BEGIN NOW pompous absurdity.  END
BEGIN NOW Wilson knew that couldn't be helped, it was the nature of the very medium of television.  END
BEGIN NOW he had to tolerate that at least, if he were planning on tolerating the fucking electrical hypnosis window hanging on his wall. END
BEGIN NOW ./....... END
BEGIN NOW "IT"S ROCKY!!" Wilson suddenly shouted.  END
BEGIN NOW It was so loud, Matilda dropped the ceramic rabbit she was holding.  END
BEGIN NOW her paintbrush bounced off her lap onto the floor, leaving a trail of deep grayish green.  END
BEGIN NOW "My gallop, Wilson, what is in you today?!" Matilda shrieked, leaping up towards the living room.  END
BEGIN NOW "You have not been able to relax ever since your Big Sur drive." She leaned in the doorway with a concerned look on her face.  END
BEGIN NOW "Look at it! Look at the television!" Wilson protested.  END
BEGIN NOW " It's my RX &! It's Rocky!" matilda looked, and sure enough it was.  END
BEGIN NOW A news crew had apparently found the crash site and was doing some sort of in depth analysis of the residue.  END
BEGIN NOW "What in God's name are they doing filming your accident, Wilson? Why is your car on television?!?!" Wilson's eyes suddenly slumped and he looked almost hunted.  END
BEGIN NOW "Goddamit.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd better be wrong." He mumbled under his breath.  END
BEGIN NOW But he was not.  END
BEGIN NOW The news reporter blared out the analysis of all the information they had been able to drag up in order to make something interesting enough to show on television.  END
BEGIN NOW "It seems there was a 3 car pile up on Coast Ridge Road, just off the One, waaay down south of Monterey, well, forty miles...  END
BEGIN NOW but it seems it was staged! Some sort of demon worshiping cult staged the whole catastrophe in order to kidnap mister Alfonso Bierbach, partner of the late Eustace Pewterschmidt, the two of whom owned the PnB furniture factory, which later became PB Penal Colony, which also produced furniture." Wilson hit power, and leapt to his feet.  END
BEGIN NOW (yes, he leapt to his feet, like so many other fucking characters int his story.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is constantly leaping to their feet.  END
BEGIN NOW Deal with it.  END
BEGIN NOW If I weren't writing right now, i would leap to my feet.  END
BEGIN NOW And guess what? I would SUDDENLY (yes, suddenly) run to the door.  END
BEGIN NOW And check it to see if it was locked.  END
BEGIN NOW And it wouldn't be.  END
BEGIN NOW And someone would swing it open into my face, which is why I have a black eye.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm writing this story. END
BEGIN NOW Wilson turned off the tv and went back to his normal life.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan realized keeping Jack hostage was the closest thing Dan would ever come to happiness.  END
BEGIN NOW Leroy lived in the beanbag at James's house for the next fifty years, never even wondering about all the people he used to know.  END
BEGIN NOW James became mildly annoyed at Leroy, but decided it actually was nice to have the company, even if it was a morbidly whiney, and obnoxious and shitty and such and so on... END
BEGIN NOW The felons went back to prison, because the legal system was just so fucking unclear and biased and lazy and it just does that, because we suck at being humans for now.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe sometime in the future we'll be better... END
BEGIN NOW and Ned...  END
BEGIN NOW  Ned just was happy, because he had experienced the other side, and the prison walls couldn't get to him, because he had learned from his time hunting ghosts that the only way to be in heaven when you die was to be in heaven while you live.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't matter what happens to ned, because he's happier than anyone else will ever be.  END
BEGIN NOW meanwhile, the author sits wringing his hands, wondering if he left any off the bastards in a tolerable place.  END
BEGIN NOW he feels like perhaps all the readers will be disappointed and shocked, and this is the goal.  END
BEGIN NOW Readers must be left hanging readers must be lost at the end, wondering about their favorite character.  END
BEGIN NOW We still don't know where the majority of characters have landed.  END
BEGIN NOW We know most of them are in jail or not.  END
BEGIN NOW We don't know if there is any sort of resolution coming for anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Would you like to know why? Because this is a demand from the author to the author to continue on later.  END
BEGIN NOW We must give everyone involved a cliff hanger.  END
BEGIN NOW we must fall eternally and faithfully towards the future, knowing the only happily ever after is based in the perpetual yearning for finding out what this leads to, and what comes from that, and where wilson will be when he finally feels guilty for abandoning the folks he became friends with, and how dan will feel, when Jack finally starts bringing up all the times he saved Dan from emotional physical and mental distress.  END
BEGIN NOW We won't know until this epic is taken up again, and i assure you, it shall.  END
BEGIN NOW the mionyety is still in centerpiece formation, and we'll get to the bottom of it, I assure you.  END
BEGIN NOW just send any comments and evaluations and admirations and disavowing claims, and such and so on...  END
BEGIN NOW so... END
BEGIN NOW but for now...  END
BEGIN NOW it must be the end. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER ONE :: DOLORES, JACK & PAPS END
BEGIN NOW Dolores never quite understood what the specifics of each ceremony meant, and while intrigued, she couldn't seem to see the meaning in all these peoples wailing and gnashing of teeth and their odd ways of cherishing ancestral essence which generally tended to end up blocking out any positivity, lost in the wailing, lost in the gloaming, lost in the lonely hollow hateful feelings of these strangers standing so lonely in the rain by the grave stones. END
BEGIN NOW Dolores never asked any questions for truth, rather accepting the fact that any individual's answer was simply that : THEIR answer.  END
BEGIN NOW When she was seven and eight and nine her uncle and father had continually filled her with unrelated theories and folklores about the origins of pot holes and why water flows down hill, and where all the buffalo went.  END
BEGIN NOW She eventually decided that since her paternal relatives thought in such diverse unrelated patterns and saw such diverse stories in such similar triggers while being from such a similar origin, all truth must only be applicable the moment it happened, and afterwards was malleable mush in the hands of the experts who could look at ten thousand clues and prove beyond a doubt a dozen different ways how all this came about, and yet, Dolores knew that while it was all true, it was also all nonsense and projection.  END
BEGIN NOW This is why she enjoyed here alcove of manzanita gnarl on the hillside above the graveyard where she was shielded from the eyes of prying strangers by the gnarled exploding branch arms that tangle the thicket of her hidden visitor viewing perch for watching strangers in ritual. END
BEGIN NOW Dolores had been born at the mortuary, and was often surprised to hear that their sliver of rural perfection was rarely if ever found elsewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Mortuaries weren't like this anywhere, or at least that's what her uncle Jack had been saying the previous night over sangria and backwood cigars. END
BEGIN NOW "There are places, practically every place but here! Where they are fearful and shun their dead! You see how the strangers come and wail?" He gestured past the bonfire towards the cemetery, beyond the field which would one day be full with yesterdays, stretching on eventually up to and including this very bonfire clearing.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores shuddered at the thought that one day there would be ghosts here.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed creepier to her to know of impending ghosts than to simply have an awareness of contemporary spirits.  END
BEGIN NOW She realized when the graves came this far, she would most likely be in one of them, and somehow this comforted her.  END
BEGIN NOW The ground under her felt electric and sharp with death, and yet subtle and calming, like knowing where you'll sleep tonight. END
BEGIN NOW "These people out there, at the other mortuaries, they hold their dead at arms length to a galaxy.  END
BEGIN NOW They can't abide the same space as their ancestors.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what might THAT end up brewin and stewin in that jelly box brain we all been cursed with?" Jack sat back and sipped Sangria, and took a thoughtful puff on his stogie while his brother Pap, Dolores's Father, gave his retort; END
BEGIN NOW "Now Jack, brains aint a curse.  END
BEGIN NOW Brains keep us alive.  END
BEGIN NOW They make us aware than our surroundings can help us transcend this primal nonsense of a zero sum game.  END
BEGIN NOW Why, its the only reason we got enough sense to do what we do and keep what we got!" END
BEGIN NOW "It's a curse.  END
BEGIN NOW Animals got brains, but they aint cursed with em.  END
BEGIN NOW We been cursed with bogey men of the intellect.  END
BEGIN NOW Aint no fixin the circles a stubborn mind will find." END
BEGIN NOW "So just because you go walking beneath a landslide you decide to curse gravity? Yer a fool Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You just drive yer brain the way you do Aaron's tractor, 'cept you aint responsible to no one but yerself fer wreckin it." END
BEGIN NOW Dolores enjoyed listening to their psycho-anthro-philoso- rambles, but her favorite part was throwing in some sort of side question, that might dig up some realism.  END
BEGIN NOW "Dad, do you find emotions to be a curse?" Dolores asked, feeling sure one of them had said such a thing before. END
BEGIN NOW "Naw Doll, there's no curse except the curse of feelin cursed.  END
BEGIN NOW That's what brings it on and makes it grow.  END
BEGIN NOW A man might say he's cursed with clumsiness so he abandons himself to it.  END
BEGIN NOW He stubs his toe, and in frustration He slams the door on his finger.  END
BEGIN NOW This makes his eyes water up, and he can't see and trip going down the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Than the nail he's been chewin on all morning gets caught on coat coat pocket and rips off.  END
BEGIN NOW He curses himself by not just lookin around and stoppin and changing something." END
BEGIN NOW "Aaaaaajh, sheddup.  END
BEGIN NOW yer always talkin trash about me.  END
BEGIN NOW Yer Pap, and I'm Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You got to be a family man, and I got to be Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You got to work this beautiful property, and I got to do Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm done! Dig yer own graves!! I need me! I need Jack~!!" Dolores quietly blushed, a bit ashamed that her innocent question had resulted in prompting emotional tensions. END
BEGIN NOW ""Oh, come on Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW You get this way every time you drink Sangria." Pap called, as Jack stumbled off into the woods, a dark and dreary walk this time of night, 5 miles through riparian hills with a dozen deer paths bum squats and rabbit trails.  END
BEGIN NOW "Jack!! Be Careful!~! " END
BEGIN NOW "I'm Fuckin Jack! I'm NOT Fuckin CAREful! You Just SAID that!" END
BEGIN NOW "I wasn't talkin about YOU Jack! I was just talking about how humans tend to make their own luck!!" END
BEGIN NOW "Well than you'd better wish me someone else's luck!" he hollered, disappearing in darkness and rustling underbrush. END
BEGIN NOW "He'll be fine Doll.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows those paths like a snake knows its belly." END
BEGIN NOW "That's pure tangle, and he's a lot bigger than me.  END
BEGIN NOW I can wriggle through because I'm small, but he's six feet tall!" END
BEGIN NOW "Well, he'll be easier to track in the morning than." END
BEGIN NOW "Why is uncle Jack all bonkers like that sometimes?" END
BEGIN NOW "I was always graceful, and I was kinda hard on him for natural clumsiness, and I guess I mighta convinced him." END
BEGIN NOW "Can we unconvinced him?" Pap leaned back and looked l a bit sick for a moment. END
BEGIN NOW "Now Dolores, we can't change people just because we don't think they're bein right.  END
BEGIN NOW People do what they do because something about it is better than not doing it.  END
BEGIN NOW At least in their mind.  END
BEGIN NOW But the problem is, you can't convince someone otherwise, just by telling them they're wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if we could get him to realize I may have trained him into clumsiness, it would just be a new reason for him to resent me." END
BEGIN NOW "Well, WERE you talking about him?" END
BEGIN NOW "I guess maybe subconsciously.  END
BEGIN NOW Not on purpose though.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess I was looking for an example, and found one without realizing it was Jack that I was talking about." END
BEGIN NOW "But we can't fix him?" END
BEGIN NOW "Nah, nah! You can't fix anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Only yourself, and than just be ...  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever that ends up being.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno Doll.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm just a grave digger.  END
BEGIN NOW I know the long term answer, and have gotten comfortable with that much, so the other stuff kinda seems silly to me." END
BEGIN NOW "So you just found something that everyone ends up needing and invested?" Pap looked up a bit startled and perplexed.  END
BEGIN NOW He ran his calloused stubby fingers through his salt and pepper beard. END
BEGIN NOW "Well I suppose I did.  END
BEGIN NOW In the end every man only needs six feet.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, the fire is out, the sangria is gone, and I'm sure you've had enough of my stinky stogie soaking the air here.  END
BEGIN NOW Shall we head back to the house?" END
BEGIN NOW "I think I might go visit my tree if that's all right." END
BEGIN NOW "Well, carry a club in case you see coyotes.  END
BEGIN NOW And don't fall asleep there.  END
BEGIN NOW Scared the dickens outa me when I had to go lookin for you at midnight last week.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't be long." END
BEGIN NOW "Alright Pap, flicker the porch light when you want me to head home, and I'll head back." END
BEGIN NOW In half a second Dolores had bounded off into the misty darkness and was soon just a faint squelchy crunch ever receding and disappearing behind a sound screen of frogs and crickets, punctuated by hoots and howls of night birds and distant coyotes.  END
BEGIN NOW It would seem odd for a father to grin and bask in the comfort of hearing his daughter tromp off into the nest of nature's night life, squawking and humming, blurping and gloaming...  END
BEGIN NOW Yet it was the best possible spot he could imagine to raise a child : intimate with every process of life, the loiter, the flora, the laundry of recycle and cycle thru of death and rot and such, the starkness of reality in this setting was unavoidable, and Pap knew he was the wisest father in America.  END
BEGIN NOW And in his mystic retreat of isolated silence he still felt as if every light in Vegas was on him while the crickets and frogs built an atmosphere sound blanket encasing everything where it sat in its complex whirring harmonies and counter point rhythmic randomness. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER TWO :: THE DEAD RANCH END
BEGIN NOW It was the slick eucalyptus at the top of the hill where I met her.  END
BEGIN NOW My car had crapped out, so I had decided to car camp, and walked up the hill to investigate a view.  END
BEGIN NOW My story writing voyage had been squirming into a narcissistic pissing match between my self obsession and self hatred, and I was about ready to ...  END
BEGIN NOW To....  END
BEGIN NOW To fuckin pay attention to someone else for a change!!! It was awful. END
BEGIN NOW Never have I come so starkly and miserably face to face with my own incapacity to actually look around and see humans who also happen to be the same fucking species as me.  END
BEGIN NOW When did I lose this skill? Why is this so fucking hard for me?! Do I have asbergers or am I just an asshole? Is there a cure for not wanting to get caught up in other peoples nonsense? Is it a neurosis or a psychosis or a fuckin halitosis of the spirit? I feel as though I'm covered in my own bile, this experience of life drips down over my eyes and clouds my concepts of life logic self and salvation.  END
BEGIN NOW Could it be that sending myself into a mud pit of shitty self obsession might be my only path back to an experience of love and light? I CANNot abide by this new logic I have spent years soaking up from those I disagree with those I exchange debates with, those who seem more logical than my puritanical parents and more active than my slothful crew of so many different places, ready for the porch, ready for the lemonade, ready for the long slow Sunday afternoon and lazing listless love the blisters they keep yer calluses real and ... END
BEGIN NOW "Hi there!" My incessant illogic ramble was interrupted by a bright attractive greeting, coming thru a thicket.  END
BEGIN NOW No form attached to the voice, just the scraggle brush back lit by the starry sky, a slight reflection of the pond seen intermittently thru the sticks, but the voice wasn't quite...  END
BEGIN NOW Anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW I shifted around and coughed.  END
BEGIN NOW Something moved in the tree above me.  END
BEGIN NOW A small shower of twigs greeted my upturned eyes, and I quickly brought my knuckles up to try and rub the rubbish deeper into my ocular orifice, and by the time I had gotten my teary eyes clear of oak duff and dry moss, there was a girl standing before me.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't guess her age.  END
BEGIN NOW Between 19 and 40, I was sure of it, but beyond that, it's hard to judge by a silhouette.  END
BEGIN NOW  "Hi." I offered, a bit awkward at having been caught in the bushes jotting down shitty flow of conscious poetry.  END
BEGIN NOW "You live around here? I didn't see any other cars parked on the road." END
BEGIN NOW "I live at the cemetery on the other side of the lake." She replied in a soft pleasant voice, but with a stiff edge somewhere in her lilt...  END
BEGIN NOW An unplaceable primal competence that is never clarified but always obvious.  END
BEGIN NOW Did I feel safer from wild animals, or in more danger of getting eaten by this attractive cemetery dweller. END
BEGIN NOW "Why do you live in a cemetery?" END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, not in the cemetery.  END
BEGIN NOW In the mortuary next door.  END
BEGIN NOW I was born there.  END
BEGIN NOW I assume when I'm buried it'll be in the field where I first made daisy chains and rode bowser, our old greyhound." END
BEGIN NOW "You had a bowser named greyhound? That's fascinating!" I was really reaching.  END
BEGIN NOW Clawing desperately at my innermost humanity to connect with this silhouette who lived a classic cliche American childhood, only except in a mortuary.  END
BEGIN NOW And the greyhound.  END
BEGIN NOW That makes me want to leave town.  END
BEGIN NOW SooooOOOOOoo badly.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's my curse.  END
BEGIN NOW I am lucky enough to wander, which means I see a lot of people, so seeing one person a lot of times means they become boring to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Let me tell you, this is a sad and self destructive way to live.  END
BEGIN NOW To let yourself develop an allergy to human connection is to let 9/10ths of your actual self die off, and this is what I had let happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly my stupid brain loop had gotten back to something applicable.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe this girl could tell I was mostly dead, and might be able to help me confront this inner conundrum.  END
BEGIN NOW She was still talking.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I hate it when I accidentally tune out of a conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW Back to life now buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW Here we go.  END
BEGIN NOW What's she saying? END
BEGIN NOW "And Uncle Jack is never like that.  END
BEGIN NOW It was just because the Greyhound threw me! " END
BEGIN NOW "Was it chasing a cat?" END
BEGIN NOW "No! A goat!! I knew you weren't listening." END
BEGIN NOW "How could you possibly tell that? I'm just a silhouette! You don't even know me!!" END
BEGIN NOW "I can still tell.  END
BEGIN NOW Your breathing changed from conscious thought breathing to subconscious thought breathing." END
BEGIN NOW "Holy shit! You have been out in the woods for a long time! I envy you this ...  END
BEGIN NOW This sacred glimmery gloaming or what have you.  END
BEGIN NOW Though it seems a bit on the isolated end of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Out here in Mont..  END
BEGIN NOW Bizmu...  END
BEGIN NOW Sacta...  END
BEGIN NOW Where are we? I've been driving for about a week now, and can't seem to recall where I was when I broke down." END
BEGIN NOW "You broke DOWN!" She queried with concern in her voice. END
BEGIN NOW "We did.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I did.  END
BEGIN NOW It's just me.  END
BEGIN NOW I had a buddy on the trip with me, but he bussed home so he wouldn't lose his job.  END
BEGIN NOW  But I'm car campin.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll find triple A in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW I just need to find out what town..." END
BEGIN NOW "Well come back to the mortuary with me.  END
BEGIN NOW it's just across this field.  END
BEGIN NOW See the lights over there? My dad is home.  END
BEGIN NOW He finished his bonfire, and I walked out here to listen.  END
BEGIN NOW His name is paps." END
BEGIN NOW "I'm not sure Paps is a name.  END
BEGIN NOW  But I guess if that's what you call him...  END
BEGIN NOW Why were you in the tree?" END
BEGIN NOW "It's the only way to see the graves reflected on the water backlit by the stars.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks more like it's supposed to that way.  END
BEGIN NOW It makes sense.  END
BEGIN NOW Like when you see a pattern from the wrong angle and finally when you see it from the right angle, it suddenly falls into the most obvious sense possible." END
BEGIN NOW "That's very quaint.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd like it if you showed me some time." I offered, trying my best not to sound aloof. END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, once you see my horrible facial scarring you'll never follow me anywhere." I was mildly shocked, but intrigued by both the audacity to suggest such a thing, and the confidence with which she asserted this suggestion." END
BEGIN NOW "Well.  END
BEGIN NOW I just so happen to know a guy with a real scar fetish.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently he was raised by a bear attack victim, and his concept of feminine beauty is so Freudian he's attracted to facial scars." She chirped a stifled laugh, and was quick with her response, END
BEGIN NOW "you'll have to give me his number.  END
BEGIN NOW I've been relying on pity dates from Firemen." I snorted and pretended to turn it into a cough.  END
BEGIN NOW We had tromped a bit thru some low shrub, and soon came out onto a moist boggy meadow.  END
BEGIN NOW The dirt squirted beneath my sneakers and seeped in a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't bothered, happy that I'd soon be welcomed into a farmhouse mortuary in the middle of nowhere with a burn victim leading me to hospice...  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, hospitality. END
BEGIN NOW As we approached the porch light flicked on and a rustic looking pioneer man stepped out onto the porch.  END
BEGIN NOW His beard was trimmed, his jeans were stained, his carhart jacket was a dark dark brown.  END
BEGIN NOW I was glad he wasn't wearing a straw hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Certain details just bother me. END
BEGIN NOW "Whatchagot there Doll, a hoodlum? Or is it a haunt? I told you, only bring the live ones home." END
BEGIN NOW "This one is live Pap.  END
BEGIN NOW His name is...  END
BEGIN NOW Well, I dunno his name.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't even know what he looks like yet.  END
BEGIN NOW All I know is his car broke down." This conversation was held in the dark while we continued on our way towards the house, clomping through boggy meadow in moonsliver shimmers.  END
BEGIN NOW It felt like something off that one TV channel that always plays gunsmoke.  END
BEGIN NOW Only it seemed more Gilliam or Burton .  END
BEGIN NOW A sudden I glanced, and noticed a streak, a ridge.  END
BEGIN NOW a bit of an extra something stretching from beneath her right eye down about almost to the bottom of her chin.  END
BEGIN NOW I decided it must be fluttering hair in the moonlight, and not a scar.  END
BEGIN NOW  ot that I was scared.  END
BEGIN NOW I had met many beautiful scarred women.  END
BEGIN NOW And they didn't scare me.  END
BEGIN NOW Why would I be scared? And this old pioneer bastard won't mind me, since I'm obviously not going to be attracted to his daughter.  END
BEGIN NOW Man, this stuff is always so neat until I get to know someone.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno how to deal with meeting people! This is why that first part.  END
BEGIN NOW The leaving town, the desperate reaching for displacement, the sudden hope to be caught up in something, and the immediate decision that leaving as soon as possible is the best answer.  END
BEGIN NOW Its obvious its ridiculous its cyclical and its boring.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW We're at the porch now, they're still talking, I'm scared to look over at her, and this fuckin Pioneer pappy is about to reach his mighty paw out to me and expect some kind of manly handshake... END
BEGIN NOW But pappy's handshake was as soft and welcoming as the boggy meadow, and I could feel the boot of my cynicism quickly trying to loose itself in the welcoming envelopment of Pappy's emotional meadow.  END
BEGIN NOW  "The name's Pa." He said.  END
BEGIN NOW "Been out here burying the best people in the world, and rememberin the rest of em as well, for near on fifty years now.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "Well congratulations Pap, sir.  END
BEGIN NOW I wish I had that sort of consistency and presence and longevity." END
BEGIN NOW "Most people do son.  END
BEGIN NOW They just don't recognize it as bein here.  END
BEGIN NOW They think its somewhere else.  END
BEGIN NOW What's yer name?" END
BEGIN NOW "Joe." END
BEGIN NOW "That's a crappy name." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, I had half assed parents." END
BEGIN NOW "I heard somewhere, three letter names prompt a sort of genius.  END
BEGIN NOW A sort of pixel logic ...  END
BEGIN NOW Cellular.  END
BEGIN NOW You know? syllable." END
BEGIN NOW "I'm Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW And Pap is a ramble poet.  END
BEGIN NOW Excuse his rabbit trails.  END
BEGIN NOW If he starts one, it's a good idea to jot down what you were talking about before he commandeered the conversation and sent it hurtling into unrelated parallel abstractions." END
BEGIN NOW "Holy crap! You two are quite a load of language.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW "Well, books are our main appetite here.  END
BEGIN NOW The graves hold the bodies, the books hold the souls.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, whether it's the persons history or story, it never quite taps into the mystery or the essence of the person.  END
BEGIN NOW Essence can only be patched in by extrapolating our own experiences and memories, which is what we do every time we read a book..." END
BEGIN NOW "Did you jot down what we were talking about? He does it a lot." I grinned, and realized I hadn't even been aware of the scar on Dolores's face.  END
BEGIN NOW It was exactly as I had seen in the moonlight, but so very subtle and topological, like a huge sleep line.  END
BEGIN NOW It almost seemed to accentuate the gentleness of her cheek.  END
BEGIN NOW On a different face it might be wrinkled up with anger sadness making the person look severely deformed, but the pattern it created made it seem almost like facepaint, as if her personality had transmuted the flaw into adornment. END
BEGIN NOW "YOU're no mutant!" I grinned.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiled in a way that didn't quite accept it as a compliment.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost as if she was ready for the conversational jiu jitsu that was bound to follow. END
BEGIN NOW "Why thank you sir.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven't been showered in such compliments since the last great ball at our local grange." Pap grinned and took a step back, obviously ready to watch the verbal spar. END
BEGIN NOW "Well, yer not near the side show my scar fetish friend would be into.  END
BEGIN NOW He just wouldn't be into such undamaged goods." END
BEGIN NOW "There's no such thing as undamaged goods.  END
BEGIN NOW Which is why I'm wary about you Joe, no obvious damage.  END
BEGIN NOW it must be subtle and very repressed." END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, thoroughly repressed.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm pretty sure that's what my name means.  END
BEGIN NOW Vessel of repression, or some such thing." We moseyed towards the door behind Pap who pulled open the screen door and held it open while we entered in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW The living room was predictably rustic, the wood grain paneling making the sunken living room seem like it must be inside the trunk of the largest hollowest redwood tree, which it obviously wasn't.  END
BEGIN NOW There were vases and house plants amalgamated around the room , framing an infinitude of bookshelves filled with every type of non generic looking book.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a dime novel among the first few shelves, but there was a shelf off in the one corner full of crumbling paper backs that seemed mostly sci fi, framed in by a selection of succulents, cactuses and oversized stones.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed as if they had decorated by bringing their favorite outdoor alcoves into their livingroom.  END
BEGIN NOW I walked down the three steps behind Dolores while Pap called from the kitchen, "Drink? We gots Ginger Ale and fine bourbon." END
BEGIN NOW "Sounds magnificent sir! Put them both in the same glass, if you wouldn't mind." I called back.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores grinned at this, and crossed the room to perch on a high stool at a corner counter covered with paperstock and compasses and straight edges, charcoal and fine tip pens.  END
BEGIN NOW It was nestled in behind a midget palm on one side and a burgeoning purpley green soft looking foliage waterfall, by which I mean, I don't know what kind of plant it was.  END
BEGIN NOW But it was cool lookin.  END
BEGIN NOW So I sat next to that plant, on a low couch of dark brownish red leather that was warm to the touch from the wood burning fire place with the metal tube chimney poking up out of the bare wood roof.  END
BEGIN NOW She went to drawing immediately, as if I weren't there, and so I quickly became fidgety before even sitting down all the way, and decided to peruse the literature. END
BEGIN NOW Every book was veeery...  END
BEGIN NOW Appreciated.  END
BEGIN NOW Not in value.  END
BEGIN NOW In wear.  END
BEGIN NOW The leather was ripped, the titles were faded beyond reading, the corners were knuckled into soft rounded edges, and some that I grabbed dropped pages like snake skin.  END
BEGIN NOW  Pap soon returned and handed me my drink, but saw my interest and didn't interrupt, rather returning to his overstuffed arm chair with the same brown read leather as the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW He picked up the book that had been lying spine up on the seat, saving his place and his place, and sat back down snuggling into the words of someone long dead. END
BEGIN NOW "What YOU readin?" I asked, still perusing the 4th shelf, which was mainly americana and English Romantics and various other "revolutionary works like Joyce and Rimbaud and ...  END
BEGIN NOW on and on, lost in that menu of human expression and experience known as literature. END
BEGIN NOW "I'm gettin back into this Robert Anton Wilson guy.  END
BEGIN NOW Every time I get a hankerin to go see the city, he reminds me what a bonkers mess it is out there in that infinite intersection of expression." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, cities hurt my brain as well.  END
BEGIN NOW Every "Welcome to city sign should have a Post Master General's warning ; unfit for human consumption." END
BEGIN NOW "Oh, it's not my Brain I'm worried about.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a brother who tells me brains are a curse, and there are times I'm inclined to side with him.  END
BEGIN NOW I avoid the city because its bad fer the soul.  END
BEGIN NOW The very core of you.  END
BEGIN NOW The you of you.  END
BEGIN NOW It diminishes in such a sea of selves.  END
BEGIN NOW And I do not believe we were created to diminish." END
BEGIN NOW "That's true.  END
BEGIN NOW There's also the shimmering, though.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, a sea of diamonds is a sea of diamonds.  END
BEGIN NOW One diamond is pretty cool, but a sea of diamonds is also...  END
BEGIN NOW pretty cool." END
BEGIN NOW "Ya can't see anything when there's that much of it.  END
BEGIN NOW It all disappears from sensory overload.  END
BEGIN NOW That's why you only read one book at once" END
BEGIN NOW "And why TV shows can suck, 'cause you're generally watching at least 2 shows at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey, no screen!" END
BEGIN NOW "We've got a screen in the backroom.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a computer screen though.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothin special.  END
BEGIN NOW Just some internet capacities to aid us in our research.  END
BEGIN NOW And Dolores finds the occasional show she gets a passing interest in." END
BEGIN NOW "Have you heard of the Simpsons?" Dolores chimed in from her drawing perch. END
BEGIN NOW "You have to be joking.  END
BEGIN NOW They put the Simpsons on our FLAG last year! hadn't you heard?" END
BEGIN NOW "I can believe that." END
BEGIN NOW "They've been declared the new first and only family.  END
BEGIN NOW the nuclear representation of a functional pixel of human culture...  END
BEGIN NOW though I do enjoy them.  END
BEGIN NOW A stellar lampooning of this the American empirical experiment." END
BEGIN NOW "Wow, you talk like a shit head professor sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW You go thru some college?" END
BEGIN NOW "Just enough to ruin my life." END
BEGIN NOW "That's my boy! So How'd you end up wandering this far out into nowhere? Lookin to lose the ten thousand teachers?" He gestured vaguely at the book shelves.  END
BEGIN NOW They seemed to leer down at me like those ten thousand teachers I disappointed by graduating.  END
BEGIN NOW Bah! Human expression.  END
BEGIN NOW A thin game with no end.  END
BEGIN NOW A byroulean strip, or whatever that loop of paper is called.  END
BEGIN NOW (mobius) END
BEGIN NOW "Lookin to remember what I was before I decided I was something.  END
BEGIN NOW I seem to remember a part of my life when it simply was, and that meant awe.  END
BEGIN NOW And I wasn't even there in the setting with what I was experiencing.  END
BEGIN NOW College fucked that up real bad.  END
BEGIN NOW oh.  END
BEGIN NOW sorry." END
BEGIN NOW "Strong sentiment, strong language.  END
BEGIN NOW College is just thought-crete.  END
BEGIN NOW turns yer brain into whatever you decide is your permanent life purpose based on the prior 16 years of social programming.  END
BEGIN NOW I hate to sound like those old hippies, but ...  END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you know.  END
BEGIN NOW yer young enough to resent anyone telling you what's good and right.  END
BEGIN NOW That must be why yer out here, where life is life, and death is death, and the twain keep daily exchanges." END
BEGIN NOW "Well come on now Pap, we can't ALL be pioneers.  END
BEGIN NOW If everyone was spread out evenly across geographic America we'd never get anything done.  END
BEGIN NOW Our culture seems to have a use for cities.  END
BEGIN NOW Even your own thoughts and logics gain their energy from your resistance, and so even you are feeding off the energy of the city." END
BEGIN NOW "Bah! Opinions.  END
BEGIN NOW You're right Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW Even engaging the opinion is tying myself to it in some way, when my life is perfect without ever dragging myself down with such considerations." END
BEGIN NOW "So where does that leave you?" END
BEGIN NOW "The purest form of anarchist : Language was our first mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW I think the mind is still all good and wonderful, but it isn't the end all be all.  END
BEGIN NOW It isn't going to save us if the world decides to end.  END
BEGIN NOW Only accepting the larger pattern is going to get us through that, and that's a brain thing, but it's not a word thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Very key difference.  END
BEGIN NOW The only shortcoming of books.  END
BEGIN NOW All they have in 'em is words.  END
BEGIN NOW Words are like stones.  END
BEGIN NOW When the mortar of humanity is no longer present, it became nothing more than a pile of rocks." END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER THREE :: LAUGHING PETER END
BEGIN NOW Jack crawled up the final sandstone stretch to the ridge, and was welcomed with a blast of warm air and a shimmering star speckled sky of silky blackness and a side of lunar sliver astride the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW He wiped his shaggy Sam Elliot moustache and scratched his raggedy mane.  END
BEGIN NOW The valley felt quiet tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW Quiet but angry.  END
BEGIN NOW Burning with the primal torment of survival, free from the sharp pains of social complication.  END
BEGIN NOW A deep whiff told him that someone a few miles down to the south east was letting the last of their fire die down, burning what smelled like cedar.  END
BEGIN NOW Must be the Larkin orchard.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack paused long enough to soak in the scene, but quickly continued on a new detour : up and along the ridge instead of over the ridge and down into town.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack knew he had never been there, but it seemed so similar to the old haunts he and Paps had pursued and cherished as children.  END
BEGIN NOW There had been walls of carvings covered in sandstone faces they had hesitated to add to, wondering in their child minds whether it might be original American Indian artwork, and perhaps it was But that was a different valley a hundred miles from here.  END
BEGIN NOW After an hour of hiking along the ridge, negotiating the occasional unpassable shrubby snare by climbing a tree or belly crawling, and finally, Jack came upon something he would end up spending years trying to forget, though finally, it gave him a chance to remember himself and his own history in a better way.  END
BEGIN NOW Though it was still pretty messed up. END
BEGIN NOW carved in the wall he found scratchings and markings.  END
BEGIN NOW Illegible but obviously there at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW It looked like a whole paragraph carved into the sand stone.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't make it out, especially not in the moonlight, but in the bottom right corner where a signature would be was a blast hole in the sandstone, some stained spatter, and a crumpled pile of human bones, bleached and dried as if they had always been there.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack reeled at the sight of the bones, and decided to get out of there before whatever killed that man got ahold of him.  END
BEGIN NOW He turned and quickly wobbled back the way he came, stumbling a bit harder due to his newfound worry that a boogey man or cannibal native might be waiting around the next rock face, but as he turned the corner he had a thought and scampered back to the scene for one last thing. END
BEGIN NOW The three of us were perched on the porch poaching nirvana from the passing evening, taking measures of long lounging silences and brief exchanges that occasionally escalated into full on conversations, generally ending in an effort to stop conflicting with the setting.  END
BEGIN NOW During a lull, we all heard the crashing and stomping of Jack coming back to us thru the woods.  END
BEGIN NOW We heard him long before he arrived, and were mildly entertained by his loudness and lack of grace, but I noticed Paps and Dolores were trying their best not to enjoy it, and so I also accepted the approaching sounds as a matter of neither humor nor consequence. END
BEGIN NOW Finally out of the dark came a man much the same as Paps, a darker wilder beard, a rougher shabbier set of farm clothes, and a look in his eye like he just buried 3 living pirates with the ancient treasure.  END
BEGIN NOW Pap stood up when he saw how aggravated Jack was. END
BEGIN NOW "Jack! Now slow down.  END
BEGIN NOW Get him some water Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW Calm down Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Sip this." Paps handed Jack a glass of ginger ale and bourbon which he sipped before launching into his news. END
BEGIN NOW "I found a body!" He choked.  END
BEGIN NOW Not fear per se, just windedness, I assumed. END
BEGIN NOW "I thought you might." Said Dolores, almost disappointedly.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack glanced at her askance. END
BEGIN NOW "Up there on the Ridge! Looks to have been there at least a decade, maybe two." Paps' brow creased in interest.  END
BEGIN NOW "looked like there was carvings on the rock, but the nights too dark, and I couldn't read it.  END
BEGIN NOW Not sure the two are related." END
BEGIN NOW "It's his goodbye note.  END
BEGIN NOW See how he signed it with a gun and his bones are just beneath it?" END
BEGIN NOW "Gaaad! Dolores! You been up there and seen that body?" END
BEGIN NOW "Course I have Uncle Jack! I'm the only one small enough to wriggle thru the frenchbroom and manzanita, and I left it as such so as to give that poor body his privacy!" Dolores seemed almost bothered that Uncle Jack would dare impose upon this poor soul's chosen resting place.  END
BEGIN NOW But she seemed to be treating it like a blind man who steps in the flowers.  END
BEGIN NOW Paps' interest turned to concern as his attention shifted to the girl. END
BEGIN NOW "Now Dolly, are you tellin me you been visiting a dead body?" END
BEGIN NOW "A skeleton Paps.  END
BEGIN NOW He's been there since before we have! I used to be able to read some of the words, but only the first few, because by the time he was getting to the end he had gotten tired of writing, and couldn't carve the letters as deep.  END
BEGIN NOW It's his GRAVEstone! He just didn't get buried is all.  END
BEGIN NOW And it's 'cause he wanted to die without people WAILing over him and forgetting his life by obsessing about his DEATH!" She seemed a bit flustered, as if she knew at some point her paternals would learn about her strange companion. END
BEGIN NOW The living would never, she realized, be capable of leaving the dead alone, of appreciating a flower without picking it, of enjoying a story without prying into it by reading it or hearing it, or developing an opinion on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh that the living would live in their lives and leave the rest of it to blend between decomposition and prestidigitation.  END
BEGIN NOW And yet, even her motives and emotions were living, and thus flawed.  END
BEGIN NOW Only perfection in death.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the flighty hallucinations of heat waves and light fractures to keep us buoyant beings of physical essence incessantly present and assumed in our purpose. END
BEGIN NOW Paps looked down and shook his head, spitting backwood tobacco from his bearded maw.  END
BEGIN NOW "Now, you're a sensitive girl, and I suppose I may have done you a disservice raising you out here among the corpses and crickets." Dolores ran to him. END
BEGIN NOW "Not a chance Paps.  END
BEGIN NOW I understand and experience things like death in a way you and Jack, and probably Joe, just don't get.  END
BEGIN NOW That body uncle Jack found is a man I named Laughing Peter.  END
BEGIN NOW I named him Laughing because of the way his jawbone was laying," END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, that spooked me out.  END
BEGIN NOW LIke he was cackling at anyone walking by." Jack inserted. END
BEGIN NOW "And Peter because he preformed his exit at the foot of a rock face.  END
BEGIN NOW Peter means rock." END
BEGIN NOW "Could you read his story?" Jack asked. END
BEGIN NOW "No, it was long faded.  END
BEGIN NOW I found that spot when I was about 9.  END
BEGIN NOW It was when I was learning respect for the dead, and letting things lie, and similar lessons.  END
BEGIN NOW So that became my real first lesson.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else finds a body and immediately goes and finds their best friend to share the shock and trauma of first real experience of death.  END
BEGIN NOW That's like losing your virginity to a hooker with a crowd watching! ...  END
BEGIN NOW sorry Paps." Paps chortled in mild surprise. END
BEGIN NOW "Now, don't be so soft daughter.  END
BEGIN NOW I've heard such phrases, and I suppose I find them fitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Death is a hugely misunderstood experience, and my desperate attempts to cling to the infinite shelfs of stored human souls, prying into their very livers of essence, picking away at their kidneys of experience, I feel like a voyeur sometimes when I pick through my library, and when I look across the field of gravestones, I am a packrat of humans.  END
BEGIN NOW A keeper of souls.  END
BEGIN NOW A stealer of essences.  END
BEGIN NOW No, I respect what you did Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW letting the poor man lay where he put himself is the most respectful thing you can do, even if he chose a silly pose in a questionable station." END
BEGIN NOW "Thanks dad." Dolores replied. END
BEGIN NOW "I got his skull!" Uncle Jack said triumphantly.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm bringin it in for analysis to the museum, see what they can tell me." END
BEGIN NOW "Jack! There's a shotgun blast thru the skull!! Why would you take that?!?!" Dolores looked a bit sick.  END
BEGIN NOW Paps looked frustrated and about done with the scene. END
BEGIN NOW "Yer SICK Jack." He said, and quickly ushered Dolores inside slamming the front door behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW I hadn't said a word, and was suddenly left alone on the porch with this skull carrying lumberjack lookin bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW Obviously an uncle and brother in this house, but apparently not a house trained one. END
BEGIN NOW "Hi there Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW My name is Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW Nice skull ya got there." I stuck out my hand and shook his free one. END
BEGIN NOW "Hey Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess they think of death differently.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm a bit rougher than them two." END
BEGIN NOW "'course! The world is dangerously short on exposure to literal occurrence in the form of primal immersion." END
BEGIN NOW "I take it you been to college." END
BEGIN NOW "accidentally.  END
BEGIN NOW My enthusiasm to impress my parents turned into a drive to outdo them which turned into a disenchantment with money, ancestry, organized religion, population density, the malleability of language, and the impermanence of social sanity.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I'm severely over that sequence of efforts, and am dedicated to not developing myself, because that seems to have cost me my interpersonal capacities." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, you don't talk like people think.  END
BEGIN NOW I did college, but I only wrote how I thought and wouldn't modify my wording or phrasing, so I ended up taking around 26 creative writing classes, but never getting any of my degrees or nothin.  END
BEGIN NOW Fun little jaunt into a whole new thought box." END
BEGIN NOW "Only creative writing? " END
BEGIN NOW "Yup.  END
BEGIN NOW didn't even do the formal english stuff, except what they required to get into creative writing.  END
BEGIN NOW And than I just kept taking the same teachers semester after semester until I was told I had reached the maximum amount of repeats available, at which point I realized they weren't trying to help people learn what they wanted to get better at, but were instead tryin to get everyone to push emselves through the same filter, resulting in a very thin and watery human bean soup.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not so much into that idea." END
BEGIN NOW "Me neither.  END
BEGIN NOW I got thru, but feel like it was one big booby trap.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure I benefited, but I would've benefited from anything I did, had I done it with proper attention and enthusiasm." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, I got to know them intellectuals, and decided I'd rather be an anti-lectural.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothin but spoutin one thought pattern down ten thousand throats to be relayed and replayed until we lay down in our little six foot dirt beds.  END
BEGIN NOW Wanna hold the skull?" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, I'll heft old laughing Peter for a moment.  END
BEGIN NOW LOOK at THAT bLAST!" I held the skull up to the sky and gazed into the teeth and out the back, a shatter pattern orifice a fist might fit through, like looking out a sharks mouth, up into the sky full of diamonds.  END
BEGIN NOW "I think I see the exit wound." END
BEGIN NOW "Yup, I do believe you're right.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor guy musta done something he wasn't proud of.  END
BEGIN NOW Trippy job, ennit? crawlin up thru that manzanita, prolly on his belly most of the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Too thick and impenetrable for deer or any big cats.  END
BEGIN NOW Lookin for his own perfect site for eternity.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what I REALLY want is to get some investigative photographers with the fancy cameras that document what happened long ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Like it would find flecks of what he used to carve the stone, or maybe it'd be the fracture patterns that continued into the stone.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno." END
BEGIN NOW "You really wanna dig this unburied guy up, dontcha?" END
BEGIN NOW "I gotta know.  END
BEGIN NOW He's a sad solitary sojourner, much like myself.  END
BEGIN NOW understanding this poor bastards story might give me more control over my own." END
BEGIN NOW "Well uncle Jack, I won't judge you for recognizing a like minded fracture in the skull of another.  END
BEGIN NOW More power to ya!" END
BEGIN NOW "Thanks Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't suffer the moral worries that others do.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm only bothered that it makes Dolores sad.  END
BEGIN NOW  Paps, I love pissin that old bastard off.  END
BEGIN NOW We grew up together, and we might be brothers.  END
BEGIN NOW I was raised by a single father in this town, and Paps was raised by a single mother over that ridge in the next town.  END
BEGIN NOW We always used to run off into the woods and build universes and networks of spy paths and tree perches, patterning the passage of animals and humans along the intertownal woods pathery.  END
BEGIN NOW We used to joke about how we was each stolen from the same family of wolves by different lonely grown ups.  END
BEGIN NOW I had the angry solitude of primal man cut off from nurturing feminine essences, and Paps had the melancholy solitude of beatific essence at the whim of primal chaos." END
BEGIN NOW "Nice.  END
BEGIN NOW You quoting someone?" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, I'm quoting myself." END
BEGIN NOW "I dunno if that counts as quoting.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it published?" END
BEGIN NOW "Aaaah, fuck published.  END
BEGIN NOW I got to know a few edges of that business, and decided I didn't like their logics, and wouldn't have the creative gumption were I to modify.  END
BEGIN NOW I write a book and I put it in my security deposit box down at the train station." END
BEGIN NOW "You serious? You have a security deposit box full of your old manuscripts?" END
BEGIN NOW "I do.  END
BEGIN NOW must be over 172 poems, 35 short stories, and 6 novellas, and 3 novels.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothins finished, but nothin ever is, so I say fuck endings.  END
BEGIN NOW Endings are unrealistic." END
BEGIN NOW "That's absurd Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW you just brought this skull back from a dramatic Shakespearean exit! How can you say that's not an ending?" END
BEGIN NOW "Aint nothin ended! It started all THIS nonsense!" He placed the skull so that we could see the lake through it, shimmering with stars.  END
BEGIN NOW "So he got finished with his vessel, and now I get to pick it up and go on an adventure of discovery exploring historical non-sequitors and spooky cultural traditions.  END
BEGIN NOW That aint an end, that's a beginning.  END
BEGIN NOW Now if I was this guy, and I was able to still be in the skull aware of what was going on, I'd be so friggin glad someone found me and decided to investigate and get my back story and bring me back to light!" END
BEGIN NOW "back to light.  END
BEGIN NOW interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Well this one is a bit morbid for me, but we all have our hobbies.  END
BEGIN NOW Any guesses who it is?" END
BEGIN NOW "Not a one.  END
BEGIN NOW my first visit is to Stan Braxton, down at Jibbidy Pass.  END
BEGIN NOW he's got an antique shop and local history museum.  END
BEGIN NOW he knows the local lore.  END
BEGIN NOW He'll have a dozen ideas." END
BEGIN NOW "A dozen, huh? lotta disappearances around here?" END
BEGIN NOW "nah.  END
BEGIN NOW just a good empty rural valley with alota nooks and crannies no one'll check for another hundred years.  END
BEGIN NOW Now how the shit did you wind up here? aint nothin but us deaduns fer miles around." END
BEGIN NOW "Not counting the nature.  END
BEGIN NOW I lost my pizzazz for humanity, and was hoping nature would make me miss the social flip and quiver, but ...  END
BEGIN NOW wow, that sounded dirty.  END
BEGIN NOW meh.  END
BEGIN NOW  ature hasn't helped much.  END
BEGIN NOW It stands as a demonstration of how we ought to behave, realistically, gently, integrative.  END
BEGIN NOW Even its frictions are balletic demonstrations of the laws of the universe." END
BEGIN NOW "Now aint that a fascination.  END
BEGIN NOW Absence does NOT make the heart grow fonder, rather intimacy breeds contempt.  END
BEGIN NOW You got a real prollem there boy.  END
BEGIN NOW yaint gonna have much fun runnin that engine." END
BEGIN NOW "I'm pokin around.  END
BEGIN NOW looking for replacement parts.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll fix this smokey old lemon of a brain of mine if I end up catatonic." END
BEGIN NOW "Nothin wrong with catatonic.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I'm about all done.  END
BEGIN NOW I assume yer takin the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll sleep out here on the swing.  END
BEGIN NOW Wont need blankets ner sheets.  END
BEGIN NOW aint a moskitter in this valley.  END
BEGIN NOW They say its the sage and lemonbalm et keeps em at bay, but I think its all them dead.  END
BEGIN NOW The skeeters can tell there's many a bloodless body in this valley, and so they leave it be.  END
BEGIN NOW after all, the closer to the city you get, the more naked flesh to insert yer proboscis and pump out a sip of blood from." END
BEGIN NOW "Good lord Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW yer gonna give me the most wonderful dreams I never could've asked for a better bed time story." END
BEGIN NOW "Bah! The worse the dream the better waking up feels.  END
BEGIN NOW You ever have the best dream of your life? The next day is like eating sand.  END
BEGIN NOW Dream badly live well.  END
BEGIN NOW Dreams are thoughts that build up in the night to take over and interfere with your day.  END
BEGIN NOW Waking up with images of long dead folk telling me advice on what I did wrong yesterday aint gonna make tomorrow any better." END
BEGIN NOW "You ever try listening to them? They sometimes say some interesting things.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, the dream is your brain trying to communicate with your body.  END
BEGIN NOW Or with itself.  END
BEGIN NOW I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW Gnite Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW don't dream too hard." END
BEGIN NOW "I'll try not." END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER FOUR :: MIGRATORY BONES END
BEGIN NOW The next morning my marooned peace of leather couch consolation was shattered by Uncle Jack bowling into the house hollering.  END
BEGIN NOW Paps was already in the kitchen making coffee, polite enough to leave me sleeping, but Jack just didn't have it in him to leave the resting resting.  END
BEGIN NOW Arresting his enthusiasm, he hooted out, "My skull is gone!" END
BEGIN NOW "Damn right it is Jack! Bargin in hollerin waking up the guest.  END
BEGIN NOW You musta left yer skull on the ridge last nite when you picked up that other one." END
BEGIN NOW "Nah! That's the one that's MISSING!!"  He insisted, grabbing Paps elbow, almost shaking the coffee pot from his grip. END
BEGIN NOW "Well it weren't your skull to start with! Dolores probably took it to put it back.  END
BEGIN NOW You old graverobbin bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't blame her neither.  END
BEGIN NOW You actin like you had some right to the skull.  END
BEGIN NOW Yer about to get the curse of old Leroy Jameson put on yer god fersakin soul.  END
BEGIN NOW I pity these exuberant soul fuckers.  END
BEGIN NOW draggin each others stories out across the map like entrails.  END
BEGIN NOW AH! OUT of my kitchen! GO Bother your dead!! Leave the living in peace!!" Jack let go of Paps' elbow and stomped to the door. END
BEGIN NOW "I'm gettin my skull back! Aint no reason she has a right to it! It's part of nature now.  END
BEGIN NOW Like taking home a rock.  END
BEGIN NOW She aint all bugaboo about that kinda stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW Why are human rocks any different?" END
BEGIN NOW "SHADDUP!" Paps hollered at the slamming door.  END
BEGIN NOW "Sorry Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack's got a funny notion about how life works." END
BEGIN NOW "Don't we all." I countered, rubbing eye boogers into my septum.  END
BEGIN NOW The result was the usual, blurred morning vision fuzz.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost like an intermediary blanket between me and reality.  END
BEGIN NOW Hypnogaugic immersion of the optic expurgation...  END
BEGIN NOW blech.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad case of early morning shit brain.  END
BEGIN NOW musta been my wonderful dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW I stood unsteadily and made my way headily into the kitchen to sit and breathe a bit before trying to piece together either the dream I just had or the present and the people involved in the literal occurrence.  END
BEGIN NOW Bah! thoughts are bi-products.  END
BEGIN NOW They occur after experience.  END
BEGIN NOW Like shit happens after food.  END
BEGIN NOW Bi-product.  END
BEGIN NOW Leftover.  END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts are what's left over after something happens.  END
BEGIN NOW Gah! Fight Back The Thoughts!! ENGAGE HUMANITY!!! END
BEGIN NOW "Nice table ya got here, Paps.  END
BEGIN NOW Thick.  END
BEGIN NOW one big ass chunk of wood." END
BEGIN NOW "Yup.  END
BEGIN NOW I made that myself.  END
BEGIN NOW No hardware neither.  END
BEGIN NOW All wood pegs and tongue in groove.  END
BEGIN NOW Found it down by the lake one day.  END
BEGIN NOW It looked like some kinda ancient remnant of a Paleozoic ...  END
BEGIN NOW Uh...  END
BEGIN NOW Primordial forest.  END
BEGIN NOW Or some such thing." END
BEGIN NOW "Still does.  END
BEGIN NOW The dark stain makes it look like it was pulled out of the labrea tar pits." END
BEGIN NOW "Ah, you don't even know where those are." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah I do! Labrea!" END
BEGIN NOW We chatted and chortled and allowed the coffee to allow us to chatter, and we laughed at little things like a bug not crossing a crack in the deck.  END
BEGIN NOW After a couple hours of lighter topics, we moved into literature, and finally we spoke of Jack, but Paps couldn't compare his brother to any of the fools on his shelves.  END
BEGIN NOW Though he agreed they were fools, all of them and forever, but he felt his brother had a sort of graceless caveman lurch about himself, while the true greats could make a sentence hum and shimmer, culminating in the most perfectly placed period  . END
BEGIN NOW And in the third hour of our exchange, Jack came a tumble grumble stumbling out of the underbrush down from the ridge.  END
BEGIN NOW "NOTHIN!" He hollered approaching.  END
BEGIN NOW "Even his BONES are gone now!!" Paps' expression changed to one of intense worry.  END
BEGIN NOW Had she lost her nuts? I mean,lost her mind and gone nuts? She musta found her nuts to steal a fuckin skeleton! END
BEGIN NOW "Come on Paps.  END
BEGIN NOW She's got a good heart.  END
BEGIN NOW She aint bein a weirdo." I said, hoping he wasn't worried about her mind. END
BEGIN NOW "I know she's a good girl.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm just worried about how the world might treat a 22 year old beauty with a backpack full of bones." He shuddered, as did we.  END
BEGIN NOW "Jack! You better get after her.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no idea where she is, but you better come up with some ideas!" He stormed into the house and slammed the door, and once more I was left with an agitated Uncle Jack on Paps' porch. END
BEGIN NOW "Well Gaddamn, my thievin niece is about to drag me into some hellish nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW Laughin Jack and the Ballad of Gumshoe Girl in, The Mystery of the Stolen Bones.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel like Nancy Drew." END
BEGIN NOW "Well, yer a far sight from her tolerable countenance.  END
BEGIN NOW Remember, think like a weird girl who steals peoples bones to protect them from scientists." END
BEGIN NOW "Ah! Don't Pander to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I aint no scientist.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another cursed soul looking for a recognizable echo in human history.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell Paps I'll find her.  END
BEGIN NOW I fetched her back from runnin away when she was 12, I spose I can do it now that she's twenty two.  END
BEGIN NOW Though I spose I'll have to modify my techniques." END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, be...  END
BEGIN NOW diplomatic.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe tell her you want to bring your expert to the rock, and you'll leave the bones there, so he remains relatively undisturbed." Jack paused and scratched his chin. END
BEGIN NOW "It's worth a try.  END
BEGIN NOW She aint crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW Just fixed in her nonsense." END
BEGIN NOW Doll had risen early, before the sun even began to taint the satin sky with its luster, and crept out to the porch, snatching up Uncle Jack's knapsack with the skull in it, and making off towards the ridge to gather the rest of the bones and return them to a place more peaceful, and perhaps closer to where the soul had come from.  END
BEGIN NOW She felt only mild distaste as to the nature of her quest, but it bothered her little, knowing that her revulsion was purely physical, while her obligation was one purely spiritual. END
BEGIN NOW The path Uncle Jack had left was wide enough for a mule, though only tall enough for a hunchback chimpanzee, the upper branches reaching and lurching down across above like pick up sticks in space, creating a constantly randomizing pattern of the creeping blue light of morning to be cast like a broken stain glass window of infinite lines across the mulchy soft floor of the dwarf forest.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores didn't mind the dirt, and she didn't mind the skull that she carried softly like a egg as big as a football in the crook of her arm.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon she reached the ridge and made light work of prancing across the aggressive rockface with its infinite shale shatter mini-ridges reaching up to break of and stumble the steady hiker.  END
BEGIN NOW She glided across it like a paper umbrella poking ice cubes. END
BEGIN NOW And upon reaching the sanctum of this poor souls final resting place, she paused, and gazed at the markings that once were words, above the blast that seemed to act as a signature, that stood above the crumpled pile of this skull's old bones.  END
BEGIN NOW She almost seemed to be silently asking permission from the ancient inscription, and after a brief moment she went to work filling the knapsack with the sun bleached bones of yet another forgotten existence left to expire like the last tray of hors dvours at a weight watchers convention.  END
BEGIN NOW She paused at her work, holding a fibea halfway in the bag.  END
BEGIN NOW Weight watchers convention? This isn't a thought she would usually have.  END
BEGIN NOW Must be reading too much Wodehouse and Wilde. END
BEGIN NOW She finished packing the bones without another odd thought, stood up, and gazed at the faded inscription.  END
BEGIN NOW What clue might it have for a post mortem investigator? Something.  END
BEGIN NOW Something.  END
BEGIN NOW The shape of each letter, the slant of the line, the length of stroke...  END
BEGIN NOW where would he be from to write like that? tall letters, sharp corners, twisty frilly stoke dissipations...  END
BEGIN NOW he must have edited and accentuated it before offing himself.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder if my guess about his name is right. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter petered out, END
BEGIN NOW His echo died indifferently. END
BEGIN NOW And on we shimmer, we the grout. END
BEGIN NOW The rocks we hold fall into time. END
BEGIN NOW I should write that down.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe carve it in as an antecedent, or whatever they're called. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER FIVE :: DAN BAR  & FRANK END
BEGIN NOW Dolores noticed a man at the far end of the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW He was mumbling a mumble that slowly escalated, and he seemed unaware that it was vocal.  END
BEGIN NOW It sounded like a train of thought, and nothing near a soliloquy and definitely not poetry.  END
BEGIN NOW "Mutha fuckin camera angle always keeps it unclear.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows where she's working, and if they're dating and if it was a hug or a kiss? And will it ever pan out? And who could have known? And here we are staring at the stupid child inside, realizing that its a simple silly way to avoid.  END
BEGIN NOW avoidance a vow to never dance.  END
BEGIN NOW the void and we the ants.  END
BEGIN NOW Tis naught but onslaught tenacious and tacky.  END
BEGIN NOW Will I be this indefinitely? Is there now respite from these things? And when the words stop gushing and dumping, will something keep me buoyant? Is thought only words? Is flight build from laws and explanations? Or is potential directly and indefatigably tied to belief? Are we bound to submit to our own assumptions on and on indefinitely? We switch, we swirl, we watch and we wish and we want for a person who might recognize what we are and how we might fly off into the night as mere blips of...  END
BEGIN NOW  Aw shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Was I doing it again Dan?" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah, don't worry about it Frank.  END
BEGIN NOW That shit kinda cracks me up.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't mind that I let you keep goin, do ya?" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeeeah, just stop me if it gets weird." Frank replied, and looked down the bar towards Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW "I hope you weren't eavesdropping on my medical condition.  END
BEGIN NOW " Dolores looked over grinning. END
BEGIN NOW "Is that what that is? I never knew it had become ushered into the American Medical Association's Big Black Dictionary." Dolores blushed.  END
BEGIN NOW She hadn't meant to make the last joke.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a Laughing Peter, and she wished she had something besides his bones to chastise.  END
BEGIN NOW Even that thought suddenly became invaded by a Laughing Peter Ism.  END
BEGIN NOW Chaste Eyes My Bones.  END
BEGIN NOW Which narrator did she prefer? Crickets.  END
BEGIN NOW "Is there a name for your condition, or is it just your name?" END
BEGIN NOW "It's called Frank Indecency.  END
BEGIN NOW No, My name is Frank, and it's called a narration leak.  END
BEGIN NOW I picked up the wrong drink at a party, and now I can't tell if I'm thinking or talking.  END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of like being incontinent, except with words.  END
BEGIN NOW 'scuse the comparison." END
BEGIN NOW "Not at all.  END
BEGIN NOW It's quite fitting.  END
BEGIN NOW So do words just fall apart in your brain? I noticed what you were doing with the word avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW a vow to dance, the void, we ants." She sipped at her girly drink.  END
BEGIN NOW "Is that a hobby of yours, or a sort of neurolinguistic twitch?" END
BEGIN NOW "Well, you got the words.  END
BEGIN NOW Good on ya! I'd say it's both.  END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a neural twitch I developed into a useful tool." END
BEGIN NOW "I don't see how that could ever be useful." END
BEGIN NOW "You read books?" END
BEGIN NOW "Yeah." END
BEGIN NOW "You ever meet a writer?" END
BEGIN NOW "Hrm..  END
BEGIN NOW Not specifically.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that could qualify as actual." END
BEGIN NOW "What do you think they do?" END
BEGIN NOW "I spose they dismantle words and sounds and thoughts and recombine them into unexpected revelations and resolutions and..." END
BEGIN NOW "And blah blah blah.  END
BEGIN NOW Sounds like you write too." Dolores smiled at his assumption. END
BEGIN NOW "I suppose I could.  END
BEGIN NOW I never tried.  END
BEGIN NOW It ...  END
BEGIN NOW The field seems swamped with people who have already proven beyond a shadow that there is no other approach and all avenues have been plumbed to their depths.  END
BEGIN NOW There seems to be very few remaining expeditions to be pursued." Franks eyes became dark and illusive.  END
BEGIN NOW The reductive element had once more reared its ugly head, and this time, in the guise of a clever attractive girl.  END
BEGIN NOW Why is the world haunted by this infinite shrinking, this perpetual retreat? Where have all the merry makers gone? this dreary lack of gumption sucks the life from me.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh the mournful gloaming of human expression, when did we stray so far from our Godness? END
BEGIN NOW "Was I talking?" END
BEGIN NOW "No." END
BEGIN NOW "Good.  END
BEGIN NOW It probably would have been rude.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm very bothered by smart people who don't write, and madam, you have just now deposited yourself proudly into that paradigm.  END
BEGIN NOW Has your brain ever existed? Will it ever again? Is it a constantly changing wash of unguessable nextness? How is it that one such as you with the gift of effervescence might shrink from the light of exposure? The world is choked with dead authors and dry moderns.  END
BEGIN NOW We cannot sustain on this diet of bones.  END
BEGIN NOW Call back, fall back, into visceral immediacy.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no other, there is no you.  END
BEGIN NOW Words are water, our brains are creek beds, and to neglect the perfection simply because we've seen something similar before, this is to shun our self regenerating potential to be perpetual." END
BEGIN NOW "You really feel about this, don't you?" END
BEGIN NOW "Absolutely! Ever since we stopped literally keeping ourselves alive, our brains have become the biggest threat to a shortened life span.  END
BEGIN NOW Is this how its meant to be? Is this what is required? Will the shadow of death forEVER reign, blanking out the glow of existence? And besides...  END
BEGIN NOW who are you?" END
BEGIN NOW "My name is Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm traveling." END
BEGIN NOW "Well that's nice and vague.  END
BEGIN NOW Where from where to both irrelevant.  END
BEGIN NOW ever been here?" END
BEGIN NOW "Nope.  END
BEGIN NOW Flatsborough is new to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Seems to be a tolerable taint of a town." Dolores twitched. END
BEGIN NOW "Taint much," Frank replied, "but it's ours for now.  END
BEGIN NOW And hours from now, it might be nothing more than a memory.  END
BEGIN NOW See, I'm traveling too." Dan the bartender returned to replace Frank's drink with a fresh one. END
BEGIN NOW "He is not.  END
BEGIN NOW He's on a circuit." Inserted Dan, wiping his wet hands on his jolly belly and wrinkling his nose to fight off an itch.  END
BEGIN NOW "He writes local news for ...  END
BEGIN NOW what is it now Frank, 12 towns??" Frank took a sip and shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW "Go right ahead, Dan.  END
BEGIN NOW put me right out there on blast.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not ashamed.  END
BEGIN NOW I pretend to be from places in order to get hired.  END
BEGIN NOW I find my own work offensive to me.  END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me that people don't want the literal realistic gory details, they want a cookie cutter palatable presentation of a world they want to live in, not one in which they are literally occupied.  END
BEGIN NOW When we decide our hopes for life are more important than reality, this is them moment when we put ourselves at the greatest risk of losing connection to truth, and thus becoming nauseated with life.  END
BEGIN NOW We have taught ourselves to haunt ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW And so I haunt these dozen towns scattered amidst these valleys and ridges.  END
BEGIN NOW I haunt them with their own falsified assumptions.  END
BEGIN NOW I haunt them with superficial shiny grinning interviews with local business owners who also happen to be part of the anti-homeless league and the banish non Christians coalition, but these sacred secret old boy clubs of keeping life how it ought to have been if our ancestors weren't lying to us and themselves...  END
BEGIN NOW Aw shit." END
BEGIN NOW "Don't worry bout it Frank.  END
BEGIN NOW I hear ya.  END
BEGIN NOW So why aren't you writing a novel?" END
BEGIN NOW "'cause I'm full of shit." END
BEGIN NOW "So call the book shit." Dolores offered.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a suggestion she would usually make.  END
BEGIN NOW This skull seems to be interrupting my usual narrator.  END
BEGIN NOW And rearranging my assumptions about prior interpretations.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe it's this guy.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems ...  END
BEGIN NOW Haunted by his own ideals. END
BEGIN NOW "Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW That does have a nice ring to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I will.  END
BEGIN NOW I just don't want it to be pure vomit.  END
BEGIN NOW Since my actual job is such trite shimmery falsities, it would cause this project to be a ruthless assault on all that we hold dear.  END
BEGIN NOW By which I mean it would be unreadable." END
BEGIN NOW "Some of the best books in history have been unreadable! That's no excuse.  END
BEGIN NOW You begin by lecturing me for neglecting my own narrative flow, and yet you stand, cursed with the self same avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW Except even worse, you've auctioned off your expression like a cheap whore in hopes of a fancy new piece to catch the eye of a panting new jon.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really mean that.  END
BEGIN NOW writing is writing.  END
BEGIN NOW words are words.  END
BEGIN NOW They aren't ever true, never will they hold anything except a vein for the electricity of human attention to flicker across.  END
BEGIN NOW I met a man once by the name of Hurricane.  END
BEGIN NOW He helped me throttle my narrator, or at least ignore its incessant insistence.  END
BEGIN NOW Would you like to hear about Hurricane? It sounds like his inputs might be quite applicable to your situation." END
BEGIN NOW "Please! Tell me the story of Hurricane!" END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER SIX ::: HURRICANE END
BEGIN NOW "What do you do when you stop liking yourself?" Dolores asked the old man with the beard the wrinkles and the bottle. END
BEGIN NOW "You be someone else." He replied without pausing.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores looked at him like he was a priest ending services. END
BEGIN NOW "And how does one do such a thing?" She queried. END
BEGIN NOW "Kill yer narrator." He replied, never once having taken his gaze from the cackling fire.  END
BEGIN NOW She moved this around in her mind like a solitary chess piece in the wake of a very one sided game.  END
BEGIN NOW This all made perfect sense to her, and within seconds she had found ways of applying it, already telling herself to shut up and listen, even to the silence.  END
BEGIN NOW She felt her silence becoming foreign, no longer inhabited by fancies and faeries, but cursed with lurking burgeounings.  END
BEGIN NOW Old Hurricane Face had stolen her attention with his gnarled archaic woodgrain face and philosophy.  END
BEGIN NOW The swirling silence of tree stance became a totem of sanity that she pulled into her own sub-expression.  END
BEGIN NOW As if her very bones were changing in accordance with her new head space. END
BEGIN NOW "When you kill the narrator, does another one show up?" END
BEGIN NOW "Everytime." He replied, "And its almost a duplicate.  END
BEGIN NOW It takes ten thousand deaths for the narrator to actually become a different person.  END
BEGIN NOW Until than, it's only changing one word at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW One choice at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW One thought at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Damned narrators are infinite.  END
BEGIN NOW Once your own thoughts stop, all these quotes and song lyrics start pouring in.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, some people think in crickets?" END
BEGIN NOW "Like, instead of ...  END
BEGIN NOW shut up." Dolores tried to fill her thought box with nothing but crickets but found it near impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW A soft base layer of chirping in her head began, but quickly became peppered with her thinking the word "crickets.  END
BEGIN NOW crickets.  END
BEGIN NOW crickets..." which was soon joined by an onslaught of every cricket she'd ever experienced.  END
BEGIN NOW Images of their violin bow legs grinding against each other, cartoons of crickets, cricket characters from fables she had grown up with, and than it fell apart when she stopped to wonder what the difference is between a cricket and a grasshopper. END
BEGIN NOW "The narrator does seem resilient.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't hold only cricket sounds in my brain.  END
BEGIN NOW It quickly becomes awash in a network of related experiences." She stared into the fire.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn't realize how rare it was for people to stare into fires.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn't realize that she was reliving ancient memories of fire worship.  END
BEGIN NOW It became a flickering reverse waterfall dissipating into the shades. END
BEGIN NOW "Be more like the smoke and less like the fire." Hurricane replied.  END
BEGIN NOW "And while you're at it, explain to me why you decided to join me on my jaunt? Just lookin for company?" END
BEGIN NOW "I'm looking for a new narrator.  END
BEGIN NOW Mine is quickly becoming someone else's, and it's causing problems." Dolores paused.  END
BEGIN NOW Quickly becoming someone else's? She shuddered slightly at what she herself was suggesting. END
BEGIN NOW "You steal something?" Dolores jumped, as did her reply. END
BEGIN NOW "YES!" she said, before he'd even finished the question.  END
BEGIN NOW  "I've never stolen! I didn't mean to! I thought I was giving it back to someone, but there's no one to give it back to." END
BEGIN NOW "Sounds to me like it's up for grabs." END
BEGIN NOW "No.  END
BEGIN NOW Its very much not up for grabs, and its very much not mine.  END
BEGIN NOW How did you know I had stolen something?" END
BEGIN NOW "Well, you been tellin stories about yerself in everything you do.  END
BEGIN NOW The way you hold that satchel, it's probably got yer bounty in there, whatever it is.  END
BEGIN NOW The fact that you seem harmless yet unworried by the prospect of being robbed, it must not be worth actual money.  END
BEGIN NOW Must be an emotional totem.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the main clue.  END
BEGIN NOW You're giving in to your totem, letting it steer more than yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW That might be why you've got a conflicted narrator right now, because you've got two channels coming in.  END
BEGIN NOW Mind if I ask what it is you stole?" He finally raised his eyes from the fire and rested them on her.  END
BEGIN NOW She shrank a bit, than reversed it, puffing out slightly. END
BEGIN NOW "I don't think its proper at this time for me to give away too much.  END
BEGIN NOW As you said, it's up for grabs, but it still may be...  END
BEGIN NOW Illegal to own.  END
BEGIN NOW Or carry." Hurricane grinned a grin of muddy triumph.  END
BEGIN NOW The 12 year old grin of an 80 year old man who finally feels fifty again. END
BEGIN NOW "Relax." He said. END
BEGIN NOW "Relics?" She asked, not sure what he had said. END
BEGIN NOW "I WAS RIGHT!!" He hooted.  END
BEGIN NOW "You got yerself some ancient bones, doncha.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe a skull?" The topic had ignited hurricane's ramble muscle, and he was about to perspectify Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW  "I knew a man who got sprayed by a skunk and went blind for 3 days.  END
BEGIN NOW While he was blind he found a rock, and decided it was an alien skull.  END
BEGIN NOW This rock kept him company through his blindness, sending him comforting thoughts and being little spoon to his big spoon, and when his blindness had been healed, which he attributed to the rock, he started touring with the rock, introducing it to what few business owners and park lurkers would lean an ear towards him as he wandered from town to town, never quite finding his actual audience, which I believe is in Sedona Arizona.  END
BEGIN NOW So you see, its impossible to tell whether this rock was an alien skull or a rock, and whether or not our dear friend was insane.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, a totem is a totem.  END
BEGIN NOW If we teach our brains to only work when we are in the presence of incense, if we only teach or brains to work in the evening over dinner, than that is the only time it will become active.  END
BEGIN NOW If only our brains were trained into perpetual competence, never flinching beneath flecks of unexpected input, the spit of thought falling through sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Relics.  END
BEGIN NOW Congratulations my dear, you are far older than your age, and I congratulate.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I said that .  END
BEGIN NOW You, madame, have approached the one aspect of life that our poor species has made itself incapable of processing.  END
BEGIN NOW And you have embraced it and welcomed it into your sphere.  END
BEGIN NOW I still keep what seems to be a finger bone." He pulled a length of nubbin from his pocket, felt it between his fingers without looking at it.  END
BEGIN NOW "I went off to die.  END
BEGIN NOW I layed there at the foot of a redwood tree for three days.  END
BEGIN NOW I rolled around a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW Went on a walk the second day, just around the tree.  END
BEGIN NOW  I mean, literally.  END
BEGIN NOW I got up, and walked around the tree, and sat back down.  END
BEGIN NOW I was ready to die.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd run out of ideas, run out of gumption, run out of places and ways to run.  END
BEGIN NOW And so I went off to be done and let that final sun come down.  END
BEGIN NOW Day three, the animals were ignoring me.  END
BEGIN NOW Skunks and raccoons and squirrels, deer and birds and such.  END
BEGIN NOW I met these animals as if I were meeting my 5 year old self.  END
BEGIN NOW Joy and delirious wonder.  END
BEGIN NOW Recognition of someone and something I've seen every day for decades and had never remembered to notice.  END
BEGIN NOW Each animal's facial expression gave me different advice.  END
BEGIN NOW The deer told me to worry and live.  END
BEGIN NOW The squirrels told me to rattle and thrive.  END
BEGIN NOW The birds told me to take only what I need and stay weightless.  END
BEGIN NOW The raccoons told me tend your own defend your own and even pretend to own.  END
BEGIN NOW And the skunk told me that stink is strength.  END
BEGIN NOW Meeting the animals was profound, but not enough.  END
BEGIN NOW It felt as though I had been sent a death bed to be envied by the gods.  END
BEGIN NOW And I reveled in it.  END
BEGIN NOW My dreams on the third night were those of a Roman God, visiting the life I was wishing to leave, and catastrophizing it, reveling in the disintegration of an essence I had only let accumulate and never intentionally chosen." END
BEGIN NOW Hurricane passed her the whiskey, and continued to ramble.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores nodded off for a moment, and snapped back out of it, feeling extremely guilty for having almost fallen asleep to a story about attempted suicide.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked up at him intently, trying to keep from drifting, but the whiskey was a new kick for her.  END
BEGIN NOW Sangria had been what her paternals sipped, and she was only ever allocated a glass per night, which brings a similar shimmer with less of an eyelid anchor.  END
BEGIN NOW This whiskey wasn't quite sippable, but just the experience of trying to get the blasted stuff into your guts was a worthy task.  END
BEGIN NOW She coughed, and gave a giggle.  END
BEGIN NOW Her thoughts were not her own, and she was ready to own it.  END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey seemed to have loosened her cranial retention, allowing Hurricane's pace and cadence to modify her own patterns.  END
BEGIN NOW But behind that she felt something else.  END
BEGIN NOW She felt the skull in her satchel, she felt the jaw bone through the canvas, and she thought of the man with the alien skull.  END
BEGIN NOW If this man had only needed a new narrator, than it wouldn't matter if he picked up a rock or a skull or a handful of dirt.  END
BEGIN NOW If that is where he wants his new narrator to emanate from, his mind will allow it.  END
BEGIN NOW His mind will enable it.  END
BEGIN NOW What was hers? Had she taken the skull because she wanted change? Or had the skull showed up because it was her time? Or was the skull invading her own, supplanting her system of experience that she'd spent 22 years in pastoral isolation developing and modifying and perfecting.  END
BEGIN NOW She longed for crickets.  END
BEGIN NOW She stilled her thoughts, and realized Hurricane was still talking. END
BEGIN NOW "The morning of the fourth day I awoke weak and blurry.  END
BEGIN NOW Dehydrated and achey, cold and raw.  END
BEGIN NOW But the exuberance I felt is something that remains unmatched in my own experience.  END
BEGIN NOW life is only in sharp relief when pitted against death.  END
BEGIN NOW The further from death we get, the further from life we get.  END
BEGIN NOW So the morning of the fourth day, I tried to walk around the tree again, and fell twice.  END
BEGIN NOW my second fall I felt under my palm something neither wood nor stone.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the bruise on my shin sent adrenaline and norepenephrine in perfect doses to cause what you might call a vision quest moment thing, because once it hit my palm, it stayed in my palm.  END
BEGIN NOW It came up before my eyes, ushered there by my shaking fingers, and ...  END
BEGIN NOW No way to really explain this.  END
BEGIN NOW It meant something.  END
BEGIN NOW It didn't speak, it didn't glow, it just...  END
BEGIN NOW Exuded meaning." END
BEGIN NOW He passed the finger bone over to her, and she agreed, it didn't glow, but it did exude.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to be more real than anything around it, almost as if it were a projector for this three dimensional hallucination called reality.  END
BEGIN NOW She stroked it against her left cheek, and felt its warmth.  END
BEGIN NOW She smelled it, and it had Hurricane's unique stench of rollies whiskey and shitty firewood.  END
BEGIN NOW She knew she had found a good travel companion, and would be sad when he got to where he was going.  END
BEGIN NOW Handing back the relic, Dolores almost immediately nodded off, puddling the canvas up beneath her head.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she was using the satchel of bones as a pillow. END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER SEVEN :: TALL RANTS END
BEGIN NOW Uncle Jack came back, and he is an agry reckless bastard, let me tell you.  END
BEGIN NOW He had cuts and bruises all up and down his arms as if he'd been in dubious battle with a landslide.  END
BEGIN NOW He coughed and spit burgundy sangria phlegm before putting his hands to his face and pushing his hair back.  END
BEGIN NOW His locks hung like creeper vines across his wrinkled forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW He was not young any more, and was obviously doing his best to avoid admitting it.  END
BEGIN NOW His stomach was a pulsating bulb of acid reflux.  END
BEGIN NOW He rattled inside like a train with square wheels, and the sky would not cease churning.  END
BEGIN NOW He hesitated to admit his own craving for oblivion.  END
BEGIN NOW People don't crave such things.  END
BEGIN NOW specially not ones such as Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd never been a quitter, and he'd always found most life in the wilderness.  END
BEGIN NOW But something had pulled him from his sane safety realm of isolation, and there was no clear solve to be applied.  END
BEGIN NOW Solvent salvation was not in the works for that poor bastard. END
BEGIN NOW "Paps.  END
BEGIN NOW Are we brothers?" Jack looked across the fire at the man he'd known for half a century. END
BEGIN NOW "We're more than brothers Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW We're chosen family.  END
BEGIN NOW That's why I tolerate you." Paps replied, ashing his backwood and slouching a little deeper into his little personal pit snuggled up against a massive pine log. END
BEGIN NOW "Ah! You don't tolerate me.  END
BEGIN NOW I been kicked out of here more times than I've been allowed to stay." Jack said, stabbing his thumb towards the house. END
BEGIN NOW "And still you return.  END
BEGIN NOW If that aint tolerance I dunno what is." Jack smiled and took a slug. END
BEGIN NOW "Shit paps, you might end up burying me soon.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm just about out of seasons and reasons to stay on this monkey ride." END
BEGIN NOW "Will you quit yer thinking?! If you didn't think you wouldn't have that thought, and than you might live a little better, a little longer, a little funner." END
BEGIN NOW "You can't just stop your thoughts! It doesn't work like that! They continue! Even if I don't look at the words floating through my brain, they're still there, floating on past!" END
BEGIN NOW "And they will continue to be there, floating on past.  END
BEGIN NOW But if you leave your brain in gear than you will constantly be hitting the brakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Thus, if your mindset is ever at risk of descent, being in gear is the LAST thing you want.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if you have a creeping idle.  END
BEGIN NOW Let em float past! yer grabbin at nothing, and it's pulling you down." END
BEGIN NOW "Is this all we've ever done? Me telling you why I feel crazy, you telling me how to dodge the brain bombs...  END
BEGIN NOW I feel like I been doing this forever." END
BEGIN NOW "You only remember your weak points Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Very human of you.  END
BEGIN NOW Very decent.  END
BEGIN NOW You forget that you saved my life.  END
BEGIN NOW You were there when Sally died giving birth to Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW You pulled me back out of my despondence.  END
BEGIN NOW You rallied me from my doldrums.  END
BEGIN NOW You tackled me and wrenched the gun from my hands when all I craved was a sweet sip of lead to end the shit storm in my head." Paps paused, and choked up for a moment.  END
BEGIN NOW "I'm alive Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW YOU did that.  END
BEGIN NOW Dolores would've been raised by foster parents in a strange town, probably a city.  END
BEGIN NOW But you saved her by saving me, Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Don't neglect yourself Jack, you deserve much much more than that." Jack let out a raucous cackle. END
BEGIN NOW "Well THATS the last thing I expected out of YOU! I almost expected you to hand me a bus ticket and tell me to heal elsewhere." END
BEGIN NOW "Bah, yer not that drunk Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Though that left eye of yours does seem to be looking for something behind your ear." They lapsed into silence and smiled with pleasance.  END
BEGIN NOW The crickets rose in chorus and spun through their skulls, the song of the silken darkness enveloping the chosen brothers.  END
BEGIN NOW This silence seemed to stretch on across three such evenings, though it only lasted less than thirty seconds.  END
BEGIN NOW This ends up being about as long as it takes to read a 5 sentence paragraph. END
BEGIN NOW "And the boy? I don't see Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW You send him on his way? Realize that burying is a one man job?" END
BEGIN NOW "He's still out searching for Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW He's getting to know the area.  END
BEGIN NOW He goes to about one town a week.  END
BEGIN NOW Says he's got a circuit.  END
BEGIN NOW Each town he goes to the library, the cemetery, the park, and the pub.  END
BEGIN NOW He's been to six so far.  END
BEGIN NOW Got six more to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Seems to be enjoying it." END
BEGIN NOW "Is he walkin the ridges?" END
BEGIN NOW "Sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW On the far ones he takes a bus.  END
BEGIN NOW He actually pulled a couple pieces of info from some of his bus rides.  END
BEGIN NOW There's a man by the name of Frank, who's got a circuit.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently that's where Joe learned it.  END
BEGIN NOW YOu know Frank? He writes for ...  END
BEGIN NOW just about every paper in the county." END
BEGIN NOW "Frank ...  END
BEGIN NOW Stern is it? " END
BEGIN NOW "Might be.  END
BEGIN NOW That might be one of his fake names though.  END
BEGIN NOW He started out pretending to be from every town in the county, but this obviously didn't work very well, 'cause everyone knows everyone here.  END
BEGIN NOW So he continually retold his origin story making it vaguer and filled with more mystique until he himself couldn't clarify it beyond saying he was raised by a relative who died when he was nine, and he immediately became a transient ..." END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER EIGHT : NO RATER END
BEGIN NOW "Why is every character I come up with a self hating transient who can't keep their train of thought on the same topic? How did this loop shrink to such unfitting proportions of resistance to shit box billowing pain fish guilt on why never made good why never finish how language fall apart when it come back we find good.  END
BEGIN NOW Not now.  END
BEGIN NOW Not me.  END
BEGIN NOW Not this.  END
BEGIN NOW Something else someday.  END
BEGIN NOW All we do is encourage what is in those around us and discourage what isn't.  END
BEGIN NOW How easy is that? How fucking hard can it really be just to simply say something true and find out a good way to add to the world and make it a better place? How did it become this convoluted fuckery of infinite variable sand unguessable platforms to speak from and qax on and masturbate your soul away with your pontificatory ejaculations.  END
BEGIN NOW My god I disgust myself.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a show of pompous thought slaughter, and aloft I stand holding the jade knife in one hand, and my still pumping heart in the other, and aloft I lift it, screaming a mohikan cackle whoop that ought to shake the very foundations of this mountain that maintains itself as the station from whence I lift my kunta kintay baby brain heart and shatter the night sky with my glorious divine expectations of recognition and occurrence and when nothing happens and I simply slump down against a rock blood trickling down my wrists, rain spitting across my face, mid clasping my under thing like the mighty softness of a woman's hand, and back we are again to the fucking subconscious craving throwing in an extra demand to make the metaphor about sex.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it because that girl was walking by right Nathan? Is it because I'm cursed with a sort of excessively sensitive essence that gets pulled along after every flashing pair of infinite eyes?  I haven't written about women in so long.  END
BEGIN NOW Only death .  END
BEGIN NOW Only madness.  END
BEGIN NOW Only taxes.  END
BEGIN NOW What shitty realms to align my self with to marginalize myself to .  END
BEGIN NOW to extramorbidly fornicate with thoughts that could be better used as filler in a shit brain fix fuck stick shift into a different gear and dont let the sounds escape as the narrator takes on its non onslaught of incomparable ramblings towards some unguessable evacuation that can't help but be exactly what we were hoping to find at the end of all this." END
BEGIN NOW Frank slumped back against his chair.  END
BEGIN NOW It hurts to write, he thought to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW It hurts like picking a scab or treating a burn or that bubbly shit they pour on cuts.  END
BEGIN NOW Writing hurts, like cotton swaps in a flesh wound.  END
BEGIN NOW Like fucking tree bark stuck in your teeth.  END
BEGIN NOW Writing is not meant to be enjoyed, though reading might be.  END
BEGIN NOW Writing is writing is writing is the perpetual suicide of the incompetent narrator.  END
BEGIN NOW The perpetual failing flailure of mortal play.  END
BEGIN NOW why do we crave these things? Why does a healthy hangover seem to be the best tonic for perpetuating this state? Will this road lead to madness? In one hear out the other, feel the heat rising within, hear the rumbling of anothers chosen brother choosing to remind their immediacy of infinity and the unguessableness of all that will end up at some other time. END
BEGIN NOW Dolores was already reading it, and Frank was struggling to control his head space, and keep it from sneaking off into another freestyle ramble.  END
BEGIN NOW Exhausting.  END
BEGIN NOW Truly taxing.  END
BEGIN NOW They had drank and rambled with Dan til the bar closed, and upon hearing that she was camping, he had invited her to stay on his couch.  END
BEGIN NOW Dan had assured her that Frank wasn't a rapist, and Dolores had felt safe and comfortable around him, so she had gone home with him.  END
BEGIN NOW Not in the hollywood sense, but their exchanges were softening and becoming more childish and playful.  END
BEGIN NOW It was 5 in the morning, and they had been taking turns trying to write something that had never been written before.  END
BEGIN NOW This began as a series of haikus, each of which Frank would have to google to make sure, and it became a desperate pursuit of the unexpected.  END
BEGIN NOW This was Franks latest attempt to break through the glass floor into his subconscious.  END
BEGIN NOW It was something he did every once in awhile, but it was always scary, and it always hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been extremely hesitant to try stream of conscious writing with a girl he just met, feeling sure he might accidentally spout out some unforgivable shit, but she had been trading with precisely similar levels of callous colorful language.  END
BEGIN NOW She finished his latest piece, and offered her response. END
BEGIN NOW "I'm not sure what its trying to say.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't seem consistent in your goal." END
BEGIN NOW "I think it's gonna get scrapped.  END
BEGIN NOW I gotta pick through it and identify the dozen narrators that are always jumping in and interrupting each other." END
BEGIN NOW "That sounds a bit ...  END
BEGIN NOW aggravating." END
BEGIN NOW "You have no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I may end up handing each outpouring to a different character.  END
BEGIN NOW It becomes fairly approachable when I can identify who I first heard a phrase from, and what experience made me decide it was the rule and not the exception." END
BEGIN NOW "The main point seems to be there is no rule, only exceptions." END
BEGIN NOW "That's an interesting rule.  END
BEGIN NOW It's a good way to go mad as well." Frank replied. END
BEGIN NOW "So is your writing style." Dolores replied, handing the sheet back to him. END
BEGIN NOW "That's not style.  END
BEGIN NOW That's the aggressive attempt to violently do away with all that is style, and get back to literal occurrence.  END
BEGIN NOW words show up iny our brain, and they somehow reference what's going on around you." Frank popped a purple grape into his mouth and met Dolores in the eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW "Its an attempt.  END
BEGIN NOW Style comes long after the attempt.  END
BEGIN NOW Much the same as jewelry.  END
BEGIN NOW You don't mine gold rings, you mine ore.  END
BEGIN NOW Than you assault the ore with everything at your disposal." Frank sipped blush from the bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW "At this point we've already gone through two very distinct jobs and personalities.  END
BEGIN NOW The miner, and the alchemist.  END
BEGIN NOW Next comes the artisans, and finally the salesmen.  END
BEGIN NOW People get good at their job by recognizing their personal predilection.  END
BEGIN NOW This personal predilection may simply be what narratorial experience occurs most naturally for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Thus, a shitty writer is very good at sounding like themself.  END
BEGIN NOW A good writer is good at sounding like anyone." He finished, placing a cheese laden cracker on his tongue and smoonching it all in one bite. END
BEGIN NOW "Well, this writing doesn't sound like a person.  END
BEGIN NOW It sounds like a radio station that's picking up too many channels and hates the fact that its a radio station." Frank sat up and grinned. END
BEGIN NOW "Isn't there a Roger Waters album about that?" END
BEGIN NOW "No, I think that's about a robot who wants to be a radio.  END
BEGIN NOW " END
BEGIN NOW CHAPTER NINE ::  NARRATORIAL BREAKDOWN END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't really looking for Dolores.  END
BEGIN NOW She was old enough to disappear for her own reasons, and I was relaxed enough, for the first time in my life, to just be where I was, and let that continually be what it is.  END
BEGIN NOW It's hard to write a story about something that didn't happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Or, no.  END
BEGIN NOW 'cause that's called fiction.  END
BEGIN NOW It's hard to write a story about ...  END
BEGIN NOW when nothing happened.  END
BEGIN NOW And how powerful and profound it was. END
BEGIN NOW The death of the narrator is a joyous occasion.  END
BEGIN NOW The birth of the action is also a pretty neat thing, but that seems to be beyond me at this point.  END
BEGIN NOW One crux seems to be my problem with telling the truth, or at least wanting to.  END
BEGIN NOW This makes all stories false in that their emphasis is overly specific, and the story ends when the focus is resolved.  END
BEGIN NOW This is not reality, this is not truth.  END
BEGIN NOW This only serves to teach people to shrink further into their own heads, expecting something out there to fix what ever seems to be misfiring in here. END
BEGIN NOW All these fictional characters have arrived at a new point, become new people even.  END
BEGIN NOW They have accomplished the goal of starting one way and ending another.  END
BEGIN NOW This leaves me, the author, in a bind.  END
BEGIN NOW If I were to prompt some unprecedented change in the lucks of these characters, I'd be forcing it.  END
BEGIN NOW These characters occurred in my subconscious because they each carry a conundrum that I've been toying with as of late. END
BEGIN NOW I told Paps I was looking for Dolores, Just because, well, I can stop by several spots every time I get anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW That's not a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW So I guess in a passive way I was in search, but it was not at all what was compelling me.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm really lookin for myself.  END
BEGIN NOW All stupid and cliche like.  END
BEGIN NOW But someone once said, nature, pure deep naked wilderness, will bring out a mans peculiarities.  END
BEGIN NOW And it seems to be bringing out some series of inner monologues I didn't quite realize were there.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that's why my road trip was spent at high speeds with the music blasting. END
BEGIN NOW "They always come back.  END
BEGIN NOW as long as they're not dead.  END
BEGIN NOW " Jerry ashed his grit and sipped his brew.  END
BEGIN NOW I gave him a lackluster grin of indifferent acceptance.  END
BEGIN NOW He can't just claim they always come back.  END
BEGIN NOW It's simply not true! I know dozens of people personally who have never gone back, nor will they.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe he's talking about something other than physical presence.  END
BEGIN NOW The memory will always come back. END
BEGIN NOW "She'll be fine man.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a question of if, its a question of when.  END
BEGIN NOW 'course she aint fine right now, but that's cause she's aggressively pursuing the one lesson she couldn't learn at her graveyard home from her body buryin paps." He glanced around the dim shabby pub as if in search of an example.  END
BEGIN NOW "There! See that woman over there? I wouldn't call her nice.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn't call her mean.  END
BEGIN NOW I also wouldn't call her back.  END
BEGIN NOW She aint left yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, she left her parents home, her ancestral religion, her origins and educations, but she forgot to leave herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She managed to forget everything except the subconscious path these triggers created in her.  END
BEGIN NOW Thus, she remains, neither nice nor mean, neither right nor wrong, neither more nor less than she's ever been." With this, he lifted his glass, and emptied it into his entrails.  END
BEGIN NOW I was mildly annoyed with his lack of input.  END
BEGIN NOW Where had my question gone, and how had he dragged me into this irrelevancy? END
BEGIN NOW I stood quickly up, drained my glass, and left whiskey stained Jerry at the bar, looking around at his collection of never do nothiners.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed a toy in a toyshop, not bothered, not stifled, simply aware that this was far from all.  END
BEGIN NOW And off I went into the rest of it, to find what I might. END
BEGIN NOW ....................................... END
BEGIN NOW Sonya knew everything that needed to be known.  END
BEGIN NOW She understood things beyond language.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady had nothing on her.  END
BEGIN NOW She owned the entire ranch and everyone on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Not legally, much deeper and more permanent than that.  END
BEGIN NOW She had Grady's depth and Peter's charm, but neither of their dysfunctional tics.  END
BEGIN NOW She was endearing to all she met, paying extra attention to people due to the language gap, and she had no motive nor agenda.  END
BEGIN NOW Hers was the beautific role of appreciating that which blossoms around you. END
BEGIN NOW This was not her only role.  END
BEGIN NOW She entered the cheese farm getting a job as a Churn Maid, a fetish term that Laughing Peter got endless amusement using.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady never laughed at this joke, but you could always catch the edge of his mouth twitch with a soft smile.  END
BEGIN NOW He ended up getting this same twitch every time Sonya entered the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya immediately noticed, and would use it as a gauge of how entertained he was with whatever was going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Only Laughing Peter could prompt the coughing belly laugh that made Grady's face turn red and eyes water, but Sonya knew when he felt at home, and initially, that was enough. END
BEGIN NOW A gushing burst broke the silence of the small patch of grass by the fountain, and the swinging doors to the factory blasted open releasing a murky flow of marbelizing yellow orange and red.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya jumped up from their blanket splayed out on the grass as Grady darted off into the mess, sludging ankle deep through hot melted Fire Cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW "WHAT IN THE BLAZES!!" He hollered, as Sonya scrambled around trying to save the blanket and picnic supplies before the flow consumed them.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady found Peter at the controls, passed out on the floor, a sputtered balloon hanging limply from his hand.  END
BEGIN NOW His chair was tipped over, and it looked as though his foot had knocked the temperature lever into overdrive as he fell backwards.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady gave him a swift kick in the ribs.  END
BEGIN NOW Peter's body responded by curling inward, but his face showed no pain, as if his brain were uninvolved in the occurence.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes slowly opened, and he looked up at Grady through a shiny distant screwball high.  END
BEGIN NOW "I saw God that time." He said, and laid back staring at the ceiling, trying to recollect the glory he had just been part of.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya was on the upper porch now, watching the Fire Cheese ooze past.  END
BEGIN NOW The air was thick with Jalapeno Habanero and Capsacin extract.  END
BEGIN NOW Sonya's eyes were watering, and she knew that Grady was going to get burns on his legs from the cheese, like the speckled chemical burns that the bits of capsacin extract left on your arm if you pressed the cheese against it.  END
BEGIN NOW That's why Peter had been so vital to selling Fire Cheese, because it entailed such a convoluted legal procedure to keep Fire Cheese Incorporated safe from any Capsacin related injuries.  END
BEGIN NOW Peter sold the vitality of such levels of intensity.  END
BEGIN NOW He spoke of the high paying fringe markets that go in for such things.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady wasn't even aware that his product was so sellable, but Peter took Grady's hesitation as an opportunity to prove Grady wrong, and sold the fuckin shit out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter had not begun alone.  END
BEGIN NOW It was not his recipe that made the Fire Cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW He was merely the marketing genius who could give the world cravings.  END
BEGIN NOW He was simply the man who could plant a vacuum inside of you shaped precisely like what he sells.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't even like Fire Cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter simply liked selling people.  END
BEGIN NOW He'd stop strangers in the street and ask them where they were going for lunch, only to tell them that while it's a fine establishment, it's not what would suit them best, instead they should try a place over around the corner where they'll get precisely what they're hoping to find.  END
BEGIN NOW Though his input did nothing, neither improving nor detracting from their lunch, he simply felt not satisfaction, but relief that he could cause some small change in the world around him.  END
BEGIN NOW Satisfied with simple reaction, not tied to what type, as if he merely wanted reassurance that he exists, Laughing Peter made friends and left them based on how willing they were to take his meaningless advice.  END
BEGIN NOW Whether it made the world better or worse, whether his goal of being noticed trumped his positive seeming input, and whether he'd still be alive if he weren't so stuck on seeing some flash in the present, all that is totally irrelevant to the story.  END
BEGIN NOW He lived permanently now, so when he ended up with Grady the philosopher cheese maker, it seemed to reek of powder keg, and to some extent such things are inevitable. END
BEGIN NOW Grady had been making cheese since his childhood.  END
BEGIN NOW Gazing into a bucket of freshly pulled milk, Grady was lost in thought one day deep in his childhood, when his grandfather approached.  END
BEGIN NOW "Watchin the cream separate again? You think 'cause you spend all your time drifting in cream thoughts you're any better than the poor bleeding bastards you're floating on?! Just remember, the rest of the world is why you're floating." and Grady was stranded there in the cream island of his own self awareness of brain activity.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't apprehend the socio-political construct his dad had just presented him with, he couldn't link his grandfather's isolationism to his own father's transient lifestyle.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't find any logic between his grandfather's stone monastic simplicity and his ethereal experience of thought. END
BEGIN NOW 10 years later, Grady was a card carrying member of the local cheese makers guild.  END
BEGIN NOW His pursuit of cheese was some complex philosophical metaphor about how milk is experience and through that we have the capacity to add logics and memories, subtract emotional dysfunctions and false suppositions, and come out with the cream of possibility, which than needs to go through some more processes before it becomes the cheese of truth.  END
BEGIN NOW  He made the mistake of explaining these things at a cheese makers guild meeting.  END
BEGIN NOW He showed how we have the capacity to cause seemingly miraculous things to occur, but in doing so we summon their death.  END
BEGIN NOW And the cheese makers laughed and laughed.  END
BEGIN NOW They raised their ciders and gave a cheers to imagination and another to fancy.  END
BEGIN NOW This than turned into a drinking song about a fancy dancer getting chased by a tractor.  END
BEGIN NOW Unwittingly, Grady had given the guild something to dismantle him and keep him marginalized and defensive.  END
BEGIN NOW He had offered them a level of awareness that their rural capacities didn't have the capacity to apprehend.  END
BEGIN NOW But to be self aware necessitates ignoring others, and Grady soon fell away from the cheese makers guild.  END
BEGIN NOW The other members would often mock him, asking him such absurdities as "are we slaves to the cow, or is the cow a slave to us?" and "If cheese ferments in the forest and there is no one around to call it by any other name, is it not still cheese?" and Grady gave up his awareness of sarcasm, and accepted these questions as serious thoughts, and he came up with a series of essays answering the questions seriously and heavily, and on that day quit the guild.  END
BEGIN NOW Leaving the meeting hall, Grady ran into a stranger who seemed to walk as if looking for a student.  END
BEGIN NOW The stranger noticed Grady, and though Grady made a point of not looking over, the stranger jogged up and fell into pace beside him.  END
BEGIN NOW "Greetings fellow human, my name is Peter." The stranger said.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady was immediately taken in by this approach.  END
BEGIN NOW Fellow human? He had never in his life been addressed by species.  END
BEGIN NOW He glanced over and nodded looking a bit confused.  END
BEGIN NOW "I see you're just leaving the community house.  END
BEGIN NOW And what goes on here might I inquire?"  END
BEGIN NOW "It was a cheese makers guild meeting." END
BEGIN NOW "Ah, cheese making.  END
BEGIN NOW Fascinating.  END
BEGIN NOW I always preferred butter, but to each their own.  END
BEGIN NOW What does one do at such meetings? And is it really much of an advantage to join a guild? I don't understand the practice of submitting to another man's flawed concept of how the world ought to be tied down and trussed up.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope you're looking to abandon the guild and aim your development more along the lines of a corporation.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be like the guild except you would be running the place." Peter had been walking since sun up, and was practically gibbering, but his subconscious was sharp and natural enough for everything to come out as if it were intentional.  END
BEGIN NOW He placed his usual negativity in the usual places to create a vacuum within Grady, and he followed it up by suggesting some absurd permutation of present reality that will make Grady hungry, and perhaps give Peter the upper hand. END
BEGIN NOW "Will you help me than?" Grady asked.  END
BEGIN NOW stopping in his tracks, confused as to why he had just blurted out that question.  END
BEGIN NOW It was too quick.  END
BEGIN NOW He had spent so long on those essays addressing the mockery as if it were truth, reaching deep within the ridicule to find the aspects of it that could be salvaged and put to positive use.  END
BEGIN NOW He had just stepped out of the guild, cutting ties with those who had taught him.  END
BEGIN NOW He had just left.  END
BEGIN NOW And all at once, so suddenly, so easily, this stranger at the perfect moment plants a thought.  END
BEGIN NOW Grady knew that he was in the current, and turning around now to see what was carrying him might only cause his foot to snag a rock and him to get pulled under.  END
BEGIN NOW The best thing to do when caught in a river current is to become the surface of the water, skidding along the top, looking down at your feet to see what's coming next.  END
BEGIN NOW To keep from drowning, relax.  END
BEGIN NOW To last longer, relax.  END
BEGIN NOW To live forever, relax.  END
BEGIN NOW So Grady relaxed, and listened to Peter's response. END
BEGIN NOW "I can help you.  END
BEGIN NOW I am an expert.  END
BEGIN NOW But I am tired now, and need rest, so if you have a porch I might sleep on for the night, we can begin tomorrow." And Peter was recruited as the head of Fire Cheese Marketing. END
BEGIN NOW A low fire cackled soft sparkling laughter into the apathetic sky.  END
BEGIN NOW The hum of the electricity in the wires overhead made the desert fauna seem as though searching for a contact point.  END
BEGIN NOW Information hissed along the black vines of industry oblivious to the reality that in reality the information was reality dismantled into materials and rearranged into an abstraction of reality, and the true reality was nothing more than the visual of the black vines, and the low hum of electricty.  END
BEGIN NOW Information is inevitably a lie.  END
BEGIN NOW Physical occurences such as graphite staining shapes into flattened wood pulp, or perhaps a vibrating voicebox and a malleable windchamber to manipulate the sonic experience of vibration, physical occurences such as these are real, but to take these tools and use them to create a parallel experience in a conceptual realm, this is where it immediately and inevitably becomes false.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no truth in a thought, because it is a manifestation of a past thing that occupies the present reality while clouding the future capacities.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no truth in a thought because it is expression born of perspective based on an inability to see the whole due to it being inextricably a part.  END
BEGIN NOW So all stories are false.  END
BEGIN NOW This one especially. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter danced along at the foot of the rock face in front of the flame, his tiny frame casting grand shadows across the scrawled lettering he'd spent the last two weeks carving.  END
BEGIN NOW His work was done and he had only to sign it.  END
BEGIN NOW In the bottom right corner of the rock face laughing peter sat and at long last not laughing, with a shuddering shot gun blast, he splattered the last of his fading mind as signature on last piece. END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter left his words, scratched haphazard and madly across the rockface leaving his stain, his story, his brain and his face.  END
BEGIN NOW Laughing Peter left because he had nothing left.  END
BEGIN NOW He was left nothing but to leave, and when he did, there was not much left of him.  END
BEGIN NOW But this display, this slipshod alter, this staging of finality, what prompted it, and to whom is it presented? The skunks and crows pass it with hardly a glance, not even a sniffle.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature goes on uncaring that some tortured human, plagued by emotions of guilt fear and chaos brought on his own gory crescendo.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature goes on as the perpetual orgasm, eternally busting splitting pushing turning and flickering across itself uncaring that Laughing Peter is now not.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature; the grand masturbator, not caught up in fantastical thoughts, rather feeling it’s leaves against its wind, a stone in its water, a squirrel on its limb, Nature is the grand orgy, and humanity is the awkward cousin in the corner, clasping her binder against her turtleneck covered chest, hoping she isn’t pulled in, wondering how she landed here among these lawless chaotic love makers. END
BEGIN NOW as the world around us dies in orgiastic synchronicity. END
BEGIN NOW While Laughing Peter was alive, he truly lived.  END
BEGIN NOW He lived in a way that made his parents die inside.  END
BEGIN NOW He lived aggressively and long into the night.  END
BEGIN NOW He lived on scarcely anything, finding his greatest bluffs when hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW He leapt from town to town throughout his early life, never knowing what it was to be still.  END
BEGIN NOW His bright eyes of childhood had scrambled across a thousand passing landscapes as he grew up hopping trains, tagging along with his no good bastard dad, Laughing Peter was an independent anarchistic roustabout ragamuffin by the age of 12, knowing how and where to make due and what to do to make it, gaining a self confidence and flow which he used to dance between the dangers of a transient existence. END
BEGIN NOW As Laughing Peter grew his eyes kept their brightness, but they took on a parallel darkness that seemed to spiral into him.  END
BEGIN NOW This wasn’t, of course, until Mary entered the picture.  END
BEGIN NOW Mary was a perfect woman, and Peter was infatuated from day one.  END
BEGIN NOW The Fire Cheese Factory had barely opened, but Peter was incapable of keeping his capacities aligned.  END
BEGIN NOW After 3 months of Peter floundering and flailing at his role of co-owner of Fire Cheese Incorporated, his partner Grady finally had enough.  END
BEGIN NOW “You go ask that fucking woman to Mary you or it means the end of the Fire Cheese Factory.” Grady hollered, suddenly snapping his pencil and throwing both pieces across the room at Peter.  END
BEGIN NOW Peter looked up shocked, and quickly darted out the door to propose to Mary during her lunch break at Macy's.  END
BEGIN NOW There is love in all things, for love is carbon.  END
BEGIN NOW And there is nitrogen in all things, for nitrogen is boredom.  END
BEGIN NOW And there is many things in many things, but all things return to love and boredom.  END
BEGIN NOW Jack loved her eternally.  END
BEGIN NOW He loved her from day one until day done.  END
BEGIN NOW Mary loved Jack infinitely.  END
BEGIN NOW From here to the end of the universe.  END
BEGIN NOW Sadly, while time and space are infinitely and eternally entwined, they are not the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Eternal love is not the same as Infinite love. END
BEGIN NOW After Jack’s mother left, Laughing Peter wasn’t able to look at people in the face anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW When you approached him he would glance at his shirt as if checking for stains, than check his pockets as if he had something of yours, than he’d look off to the right, as if checking to see if he was being followed.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes began spiraling badly.  END
BEGIN NOW He started buying Nitrous Oxide containers, trying to feel like a modern day Gatsby, and in the end he successfully captured some small corner of the Gatsby Experience. END
BEGIN NOW Well done, Laughing Peter. END
BEGIN NOW It was a crisp autumn morning when Angela Lansbury found herself at the dining room table, tea on a saucer, toast cooling on a plate.  END
BEGIN NOW An array of jams, preserves, marmalade and jelly spread before her in anticipation.  END
BEGIN NOW Angela Lansbury holds her tea like a child holds a bird found broke neck near a large window.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her face goes through an array of emotions, wide eyed and pensive, tight lipped and discerning, open mouthed in mild surprise.  END
BEGIN NOW She nurses her tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Her toast looks up at her from the plate.  END
BEGIN NOW How cruel, to be surrounded by such variety of accoutrements.  END
BEGIN NOW “I think, today, that I should like to purchase some new boots.” Angela Lansbury sets her tea down.  END
BEGIN NOW Her mouth makes a small circle and her eyes wander around the room.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the toast.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re nothing like a pair of boots.” She says.  END
BEGIN NOW The toast has nothing to say.  END
BEGIN NOW Certainly the toast was not a pair of boots.  END
BEGIN NOW Wearing toast on your feet would be terribly impractical.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless, perchance you had to walk on a puddle of soup.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe you came across a stream of peanut butter.  END
BEGIN NOW  It wasn’t even raining outside.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW Toast boots. END
BEGIN NOW Angela Lansbury looks out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW She watches a girl on a bicycle ride by.  END
BEGIN NOW She draws the blinds.  END
BEGIN NOW Peeks out through a slit.  END
BEGIN NOW Watches the street, looks back at the toast with disdain and suspicion.  END
BEGIN NOW “Boots, boots, boots!” Angela sings in Broadway fashion.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face dances around inquiry, pleasant shock, and anxiety.  END
BEGIN NOW  She walks lightly in her slippers across a sparse wooden floor. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, whatever became of my purse?” She talks out loud to no one in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW She is, after all, home alone.  END
BEGIN NOW Angela digs around the closet, the dresser, the hook behind the door.  END
BEGIN NOW She mutters sweet nothings like absentminded crumbs brushed off the table of her own self awareness.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face is a plate of disbelief when the beans of incredulousness have half mixed with the rice of concern.  END
BEGIN NOW The corn tortilla chips of her eyes are heavy with the dip of years. END
BEGIN NOW Angela Lansbury’s eyes drift to her mantle.  END
BEGIN NOW To her eleven awards.  END
BEGIN NOW Marks of achievement in the entertainment industry.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s caught in the pull of a polished metal gleaming without mercy on the mantle above the fireplace she can no longer stoke.  END
BEGIN NOW The fireplace is decorated with dry logs, a poker, and a small shovel.  END
BEGIN NOW Ancient ashes in old brick hearth.  END
BEGIN NOW 	On the edge of the valley, nestled within the rocks, the sparse foliage, trees, shurbs and weeds, there’s a church of stone, marble, morter and prayers.  END
BEGIN NOW Three domes stand tall, and a series of bells resound in echos off the far distant side of the valley wall.  END
BEGIN NOW They peel, breaking the morning fog, hanging and hugging, sliding down and cascading, enveloping the rocks and a fox is looking for strays.  END
BEGIN NOW He can hear chickens half a mile down a dirt road.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears the cats, all four of them, mousing in the dew dusted grass.  END
BEGIN NOW The goats, the dogs, and footsteps on stones, the click of sandels, of two dozen or so feet hurrying to morning prayers.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a chapel on the hill overlooking the complex, a set of rooms, anterooms, workrooms and places to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW This isn’t a prison, but they’re still called cells.  END
BEGIN NOW The sisters make a black line against the dawn, passing through the garden in single file, wordless, lips moving in prayer and fingers passing over black knotted ropes saying silently, making all the motions lord jesus christ have mercy on me a sinner.  END
BEGIN NOW A heavy set of double wooden doors creak open and they pass in, venerating icons of the virgin mother and the lord and saviour.  END
BEGIN NOW Lighting beeswax candles in front of the alter, making many signs of the cross, lots of bowing and kneeling.  END
BEGIN NOW From a side door, the youngest enters, having called everyone to prayer with the bells.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name at birth was Bethany, but here she is known as Angeliki.  END
BEGIN NOW She left home this year to be with God.  END
BEGIN NOW She is sixteen as of last month, according to the calander that puts her birthday in August.  END
BEGIN NOW She is quiet and reserved, she works hard and spends her mind on day dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW She often wanders in the garden at night, smelling roses and petting the cats.  END
BEGIN NOW Her head is bowed now, trying to concentrate on the icons, the incense, the prayers and oh lord jesus christ have mercy on me a sinner.  END
BEGIN NOW She has callouses between her thumb and forefinger from passing the black wool knots.  END
BEGIN NOW Her prayer rope hangs to her feet and is always in motion.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s too young to be a nun, she hasn’t been fully initiated, she has no set task, so she cleans, tends to the animals, reads and prays.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The floor of Angeliki’s cell is spotless save the dust which settles nightly around her prostate form on the hard wood.  END
BEGIN NOW Her bed is always made and if she uses it, she never goes under the covers.  END
BEGIN NOW She lays, stiff, comatose for a few hours a night, lips still moving.  END
BEGIN NOW Her breathing slows and evens out.  END
BEGIN NOW She relaxes all the muscles in her body, only moving her tongue and lips; not making a sound.  END
BEGIN NOW She has few treasures to herself.  END
BEGIN NOW A few books on the lives of the saints.  END
BEGIN NOW Letters from her parents that she keeps next to a picture of all of them.  END
BEGIN NOW A single honey orange rose gives the room some color.  END
BEGIN NOW The curtains are always open, sometimes the window as well.  END
BEGIN NOW Angeliki knows little of the outside world, growing up sheltered, homeschooled, secluded.  END
BEGIN NOW Her parents were kind, soft spoken church goers.  END
BEGIN NOW They tithed, they prayed.  END
BEGIN NOW They read books by the holy fathers to her when they still called her Bethany.  END
BEGIN NOW Her friends are all church friends.  END
BEGIN NOW Her mentors are only known from within the walls and between the icons of a place of worship.  END
BEGIN NOW She knows nothing of the outside world.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Father Michael’s voice is old.  END
BEGIN NOW His back is bent just under the shoulders and a long gray beard hangs down to his belly.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears the robes of a Greek priest, golden and silver inlays, white cloth with reds and purples.  END
BEGIN NOW He stand in front of the alter, swaying an incenser, a trail of smoke billowing out from the finely crafted metel, with bells so it makes a shu-ksh sound everytime it comes forward.  END
BEGIN NOW He has been a priest for some thirty-seven years, he lives down the road with his wife, a kind old woman that never ceases to smile in front of guests.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hands have been baking all morning, nice breads and rolls for their house, a little something for the sisters.  END
BEGIN NOW Her given name was Catherine, but she chose the name of Anna.  END
BEGIN NOW She birthed two sons and a daughter.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the sons was killed by a passing car while jogging.  END
BEGIN NOW His picture stands on the mantle, with a fresh dandilion next to it every day.  END
BEGIN NOW His given name was Johnathan and he kept it until the day he died.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The service is beginning with prayers and songs, slow hymns in greek with byzantine melodies.  END
BEGIN NOW The choir is divided on both sides of the cross shaped church.  END
BEGIN NOW An array of icons painted far across the atlantic, in the heart of Greece, line the walls, the alter, the domes.  END
BEGIN NOW The virgin and chirst child stare out of unblinking eyes, following you around the room.  END
BEGIN NOW There are no smiles in this room save one sister, stewing in memories.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s remembering the rush of the first autumn breeze, the smell of pancakes with maple syrup and melted butter her father would make on Saturdays; Chimneys exhaling into mid season skies.  END
BEGIN NOW She snaps back to attention and notices Mother looking at her, stern, concerned and a little exhausted.  END
BEGIN NOW Her smile fades and her lips move in silent repetition.  END
BEGIN NOW Her fingers feeling over the knots, pausing at the large one to recite the Our Father, the next large knot for a prayer to the Theotokos.  END
BEGIN NOW Her head is bowed again, and she stares at the marble tiles until the grout blurs.  END
BEGIN NOW Her given name was Emily, but here she is called Irini.  END
BEGIN NOW She was fourteen when she arrived at this monestary, and that was five years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The sisters not of song stand scattered on plush rugs of no religious significance.  END
BEGIN NOW They stand in a state of half attention to the service and half to their own prayers.  END
BEGIN NOW The oldest sister stands by the door in the back, mumbling quietly in greek.  END
BEGIN NOW Her parents called her Sarah, but she was given the name Nona when she was initiated thirty-two years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW It was her twentieth birthday, and her parents didn’t know what else to do with her.  END
BEGIN NOW Nona has been to Greece.  END
BEGIN NOW She has seen from an early age, icons that weep sweet perfumes.  END
BEGIN NOW She has seen monks and holy fathers levitate while deep in prayer.  END
BEGIN NOW She talked to a hermit that seemed to receive food from animals.  END
BEGIN NOW She has venerated pieces of the cross of Christ, the Hand of Mary Magdelene, bones, pieces of cloth, all some part of a saint.  END
BEGIN NOW She has taken all of this in, and she still has her doubts.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face is sun wrinkled and tan from working outside most of her adult life.  END
BEGIN NOW She tends the vegetables, and she weaves.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Father Michael begins reading the epistle for the day.  END
BEGIN NOW Nina sneezes, twice in rapid succession.  END
BEGIN NOW She covers her mouth with her hands, getting snot and mucas all over her prayer rope, she makes a noise and Mother Thekla clears her throat with an air of authority.  END
BEGIN NOW Nina walks outside, looking for something to clean her rope off with.  END
BEGIN NOW She knows she’s going to get some kind of task for the outburst of disgust.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like animal refuse, or taking things to the compost heap.  END
BEGIN NOW Nina has was initiated two years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been something of a problem for Mother Thekla.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything that girl touches… Just doesn’t work out.  END
BEGIN NOW She must have arrived here at her wits end.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe at a monastery she wouldn’t destroy so much.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe here she will find some kind of peace.  END
BEGIN NOW Her birth certificate states her name as Theresa and only her little brother still calls her that. END
BEGIN NOW Making candles by hand requires patience.  END
BEGIN NOW Dipping and spinning and dripping and dipping again.  END
BEGIN NOW Layer after layer of beeswax END
BEGIN NOW 	She’s half asleep, curled fetal on the couch,  there’s a high chance that an old Peter Tosh record is playing on an antique phonograph, expertly restored and crystal clear.  END
BEGIN NOW Her long oak and mahogany trim desk is littered with orange Zig-Zag papers, shake, books and records, both audio and accounting.  END
BEGIN NOW There are two photographs, both in sepia stain, age worn.  END
BEGIN NOW Frozen in time, there she is, whispering in her ear, Day of the Dead parade going on in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Graciela… END
BEGIN NOW 	There’s a row of empty tequila bottles on the back window sill, dust coated, long since drained.  END
BEGIN NOW  The Skeez herself is reclining, waiting, and mentally going over books in her head.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a book open on her lap, lists of names and amounts next to.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s half asleep on the couch, a half burned bowl in one hand.  END
BEGIN NOW Julio knocks twice. END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock. END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock… END
BEGIN NOW 	“Sí?” It comes out muddled and sleepy.  END
BEGIN NOW Croaking and cooing, just some throat vibrations.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Señora, hay un señor en mesa veinte y tres …” END
BEGIN NOW 	Sí sí.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll be right out.  END
BEGIN NOW Gracias Julio.  END
BEGIN NOW Greeting tables, meeting the people, the restaurant people, just a front, really.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a list of various associates.  END
BEGIN NOW Drug people, restaurant people, spiritual people… She could go on.  END
BEGIN NOW People come to the Skeez out of need.  END
BEGIN NOW Be it hunger, money, addictions, she has them covered.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a matriarch in her own time, at only thirty-two years old.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her hair, long and black hangs in dreadlocks tied together in the back.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes, never shallow, dark, penetrating gaze clock-ward.  END
BEGIN NOW First table of the night to play for.  END
BEGIN NOW She saunters out, in robes of silk with Aztec patterns, says greetings and exchanges pleasantries.  END
BEGIN NOW Nods, smiles, all with uncanny knack.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s a natural, really.  END
BEGIN NOW She pleases; she leaves the guests still in awe, still pondering the mystery.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks like she has something to hide, something really worth knowing about.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s sitting back down on the couch when the phone rings. END
BEGIN NOW 	It’s Duck, again. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Señora Skeez…” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hey Duck, what’s up?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Oh you know, just lookin’” END
BEGIN NOW 	“I see, I see.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry I gotcha covered.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Coo, be over in a minute?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Sweet deal.” END
BEGIN NOW 	These hook ups are easy, even if the quantity is small.  END
BEGIN NOW The real cash is in the artists, she figured.  END
BEGIN NOW Cats that have that special something are always looking to get high.  END
BEGIN NOW She likes artists; she’s a connoisseur of sorts.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls out a large zip lock from the freezer in the alcove.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the best you can get in town; she’ll put money on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck would put money on it.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows The Skeez would never dick around with herb.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows because he’s listened to her expound on the herb, its many virtues and benefits.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows because she feels the herb is sacred.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a bond he can trust.  END
BEGIN NOW People with spiritual connections to drugs can be trusted.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows how mortals deal with the unknown.  END
BEGIN NOW 	He genuinely likes The Skeez.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks she’s a pretty cool chick.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s only twelve years his senor, and she makes him feel relaxed.  END
BEGIN NOW Like he can tell her anything.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s how she likes it.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck ain’t so bad, really.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a bit neurotic.  END
BEGIN NOW  But fuck man, who isn’t? She’s goes to the phonograph and puts on some Smokey Robinson.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck will dig it when he gets here.  END
BEGIN NOW She knows how music can sway a mood.  END
BEGIN NOW And Duck was one of the moody ones.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of ups and downs.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t mind really; but business is business.  END
BEGIN NOW He knocks three times in slow succession, peaking his head in the door. END
BEGIN NOW 	I don’t like you.  END
BEGIN NOW But I love you.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“’Sup Skeez,” It’s really not a question.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Kickin’ it, as per usual, you know how we do.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Rock on.” He picks up on You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me wafting over the dust and haze, now grinning.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“So do you have something special for me?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Few things came in today, actually.  END
BEGIN NOW Two strains, I’ve had the Kush before, pretty sure you bought one off me a few months back, good strain, good high, smokes like a dream.  END
BEGIN NOW And then there’s this new one, doesn’t have a name yet, but look at it.” END
BEGIN NOW 	It looks glitter coated, sending off disco ball vibes under the light.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a coating of kief in the bottom of the bag.  END
BEGIN NOW The room is invaded by the smell, like a skunk that’s been rolling around in pine.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Damn…”  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Here, we’ll burn one to see if you like it.  END
BEGIN NOW Tequila?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“On the rocks, sure.”  END
BEGIN NOW 	She sways to the alcove, picks up a dusty bottle and two tumblers.  END
BEGIN NOW She drops five ice cubes in Duck’s glass one by one.  END
BEGIN NOW And the tequila cascades over the top, cracking two of the cubes.  END
BEGIN NOW She plops down next to him, and takes the spoon from the coffee table, smacking it flat on the palm of her hand to get the ashes out.  END
BEGIN NOW They end up in an ashtray that’s shaped like a turtle.  END
BEGIN NOW She packs a bowl, sprinkling a bit of the kief on top.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Also, I got a few grams of hash in, real shit straight from India.  END
BEGIN NOW Mushrooms tomorrow, maybe some acid next week; if you’re looking for some coke, it’s going to have to wait a while, my guy got held up for a bit in London.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Maybe a gram or two of hash,” he receives the bowl in gratitude, sparks it and inhales deeply, right to the diaphragm.  END
BEGIN NOW Passes it back, exhaling, watching the smoke drift to the ceiling fan, always on a slow cycle.  END
BEGIN NOW It creeps up on him, a little more with each puff.  END
BEGIN NOW It has a piney taste, with hints of lavender and lemon.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a while since he’s had something this good. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Jesus…I’m sold,” He red eyes his surroundings, relaxes, lets the music come at him in waves; tapping his fingers in time with the Miracles.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a nice high, not too stony, just enough to get shit done and still be pleasantly fucked.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll take one of each then, middling for a friend, you know how it is.”  END
BEGIN NOW 	“She cute?” She winks and smiles. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Yeah, you could say that,” Implications of severe understatements.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“You’ve got a bad habit, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Always middling for a cute girl, it’s kinda funny really.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“You’d like this one…” grinning from ear to ear and blushing a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW “She’s got a voice like you wouldn’t believe, hits you in the gut and gives you goose bumps.  END
BEGIN NOW My god, she’s adorable, and her eyes…” The way he smiles says more than any words could convey.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“She’s just so… perfect…” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Awww Duck, you’re adorable.” Empathically she’s grinning right along with him. END
BEGIN NOW 	“So yeah, I’m pretty far gone.” He sips a little, letting it sooth the smoke torn throat.  END
BEGIN NOW Red face more so now with alcohol involved.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“She got a name?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Callia…Callia Sommer.” Just saying the name gives him a warm rush, tingling and radiating out from the heart.  END
BEGIN NOW He marinades in it.  END
BEGIN NOW “So what’s new with you? Let’s see, last I was here was about, two weeks ago?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Damn, alright, uh,” The Skeez pauses, recollection churning away inside her head. END
BEGIN NOW 	“So I’m dating this girl that works down at The Republik, you know that new club off Seventh? She’s alright, you know? We get along pretty well, she’s great in bed; most amazing dark, red hair I’ve ever seen.  END
BEGIN NOW Excellent taste in music” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Any drawbacks so far?”  END
BEGIN NOW 	“She’s a huge pothead,” Laughing about it now, the both of them. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Well shit, who isn’t around here?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Don’t know, can’t associate with those types, really fucks me up, you know?” She’s weighing out the bags, licking the ends after rolling it up.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Did you want to see the hash now, or save it for next time?” She doesn’t need to be a pushy pusher, not with Duck. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Let’s save it a bit, call you in a day or two, depending.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“That works.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatcha up to for the rest of the day?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“First, this delivery, then I’ll be at the Afternoon for a while.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Right on, tell Jolie I said hi.”  END
BEGIN NOW 	“As a kite!” They giggle.  END
BEGIN NOW She hands him the double, and he places it with care inside his book bag, one in each pocket, the better stuff marked to prevent mix up.  END
BEGIN NOW He gets up and stretches, says thanks for the tequila and such.  END
BEGIN NOW They hug goodbye and he makes his way to the back door, past the alcove.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The air outside is warm, not so bad for early evening, summer weather definitely.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck Augustine is dressed in an old, well worn pair of jeans, a beat up pair of Vans, and a zipped up black hooded sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls up his sleeves and unzips the sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW Bailamos is located just off Main, right around the corner of 4th, where the old pool hall used to be.  END
BEGIN NOW The outside is simple, tasteful décor, the name painted on in large black letters on tan bricks.  END
BEGIN NOW The remains of a mural, now weather worn, paint chipped, hang on that wall farther down.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a couple of couples, dancing to a mariachi band.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a few cars parked along the sidewalk, metered all day.  END
BEGIN NOW The Skeez has one of them rigged so her spot always has an hour left.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck takes all this in, still grinning like a stoned idiot.  END
BEGIN NOW 	He reaches into his left pocket, pulling out a cell phone and half a pack of Camel Lights.  END
BEGIN NOW One handed, opens and props one up to his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW Puts the pack back gently, produces a green Bic from the other pocket and lights.  END
BEGIN NOW Inhale, exhale, all over again.  END
BEGIN NOW The nicotine hits a bit hard on the incredible mellow that’s been going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Callia, Callia, indeed.  END
BEGIN NOW And how she melts me when she smiles, turning all to warm mush on the inside; can’t wait for the next open mic.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d sooner die than never see her again.  END
BEGIN NOW God what a hold, and for only that one time.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s got me in a spell, wrapped around her finger for sure.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t even want to escape this, this high, this rushing tumbling crazy feeling.  END
BEGIN NOW Better by the second.  END
BEGIN NOW And love really is just another four letter word, (thanks Bob), all void of genuine niceties, bitter implications really.  END
BEGIN NOW And let’s see, three more blocks to The Afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW On foot, no less, need to get a car, somehow right? Somehow.  END
BEGIN NOW This is how it starts.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a hangover, and not a nice one.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to be a few bottles of wine, beer break, whiskey punctuated with five shots of vodka hangover.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re going to need to take a mean shit before you shower.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll feel worse as you shit.  END
BEGIN NOW The last liquids in your body will leave you and your head will pound and ache on all sides.  END
BEGIN NOW The shower will steam up and in you go.  END
BEGIN NOW The water will feel much better.  END
BEGIN NOW You might want to drink some, still hot right from the shower head.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll stand in the water for minutes or hours waiting to feel normal again.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll scrub your body, wash out your ass, wash your hair, shave your balls and if you’re up to the task masturbate furiously.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a rough morning and everyone needs a good orgasm now and then.  END
BEGIN NOW Then you towel off, dry up, put on some fresh clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW You have a bus to catch in a few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t bother shaving your face.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no time for that.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe later.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus leaves at 1:05 and you just make it.  END
BEGIN NOW It costs four dollars for an hour long ride over the brown hills of California summer.  END
BEGIN NOW Your job right now is to observe everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Every sign, every person on that bus.  END
BEGIN NOW Because this bus might crash today.  END
BEGIN NOW Because you might never make it anywhere except the center divide.  END
BEGIN NOW So take a look around right now and keep it up all the way to San Jose.  END
BEGIN NOW At the train station you’ll check the schedule.  END
BEGIN NOW The train will depart in 45 minutes, but you can’t wait that long.  END
BEGIN NOW So you take the express bus which costs 3.50.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s really 1.75 but they charge you 3.50.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re terrible people.  END
BEGIN NOW Bus drivers.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Sit in the back and put your feet up.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s only two of you on this bus so relax, nothing terribly important is going to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Put your sunglasses on, and try to rest your head.  END
BEGIN NOW The hangover should be receeding by now.  END
BEGIN NOW All the bumps in the road are not going to help whatsoever.  END
BEGIN NOW But don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything’s going to be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW The brown grass, dead grass hillsides will there.  END
BEGIN NOW The freeway will hum along.  END
BEGIN NOW Just don’t give up your seats.  END
BEGIN NOW You should be taking up three of them.  END
BEGIN NOW One for your ass and two for your legs.  END
BEGIN NOW You paid three fifty, use all of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise you’re just a sucker.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not your goal today.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be that guy. END
BEGIN NOW Part I END
BEGIN NOW Like most stories this begins in a bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a night club, social club, bar and grill, or a pub.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a bar.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where you go to drink.  END
BEGIN NOW When you’re thirsty.  END
BEGIN NOW When sobriety doesn’t sound so pleasant anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a destination of those destined to be drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no food here, no dance floor.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re only distraction is the jukebox.  END
BEGIN NOW Or perhaps that girl sitting at the end of the bar, stirring her drink with her finger.  END
BEGIN NOW She licks it clean and motions the bartender over.  END
BEGIN NOW “It’s not strong enough, pour another shot in.” END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t need to be polite.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a very pretty girl.  END
BEGIN NOW People will forgive her.  END
BEGIN NOW She has no need for niceties, nuance, or subtleties.  END
BEGIN NOW The subtle tease sucks vodka off her finger. END
BEGIN NOW “Perfect.” END
BEGIN NOW She takes a long, slow sip, closes her eyes tight and exhales slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW Purpose.  END
BEGIN NOW She aims for intoxication.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s on a mission.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks through her purse and comes up empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, she’s looking at you.  END
BEGIN NOW Stay calm; we’ve handled these kinds of situations before. END
BEGIN NOW “Got an extra cigarette?” She asks.  END
BEGIN NOW And her voice isn’t mentholated; it’s unfiltered and not light.  END
BEGIN NOW She sounds like Lauren Bacall if Lauren Bacall were a Cuban cigar.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to reply nonverbally, extending your pack, flicking the box open with your index and pushing one forward with your thumb.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes it and you light it, like a perfect gentleman.  END
BEGIN NOW She nods instead of saying thanks.  END
BEGIN NOW You nod back like a sucker.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to try and get you to buy the next drink.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where you have to make a stand.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where you put your foot down.  END
BEGIN NOW But there’s a white flag in your pants.  END
BEGIN NOW Your white flag says it’s worth a shot.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been wrong before. END
BEGIN NOW But really, why not? What’s the worst that could happen? You won’t get laid and spend maybe forty dollars and have a stupid conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be a bummer night but at least you got to spend some time talking to a pretty girl.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW It sure as hell beats spending the night drinking by yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW You finish your drink and order two vodka tonics.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender gives you this look.  END
BEGIN NOW He gives you the look etched on the face of every bearer of bad news; it’s not his job to save you.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re beyond redemption.  END
BEGIN NOW You bought the girl a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender sets the glass down in front of her.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a taste with her finger and motions the bartender back over, pointing at her drink.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles and bats her eyelashes.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender shakes his head, reaches for the vodka and pours another shot in. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re such a sweetheart,” She coos, blowing smoke rings over each syllable. END
BEGIN NOW The bartender sighs.  END
BEGIN NOW She lifts her glass at you and smiles, tilting her head.  END
BEGIN NOW You get a good look at the softness of her face, the delicate symmetry at work there.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes like two glass marbles pretending to be twin suns going nova at the bottom of the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW You hope that’s just the out of focus effect of a little too much to drink.  END
BEGIN NOW You say “Cheers,” with as little awkward inflection as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW She moves a few stools closer and your palms sweat.  END
BEGIN NOW You feel a little light headed.  END
BEGIN NOW Now you have to step up.  END
BEGIN NOW Say something, be funny.  END
BEGIN NOW Pretty girls like to laugh.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re charming.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re witty.  END
BEGIN NOW You can do this. END
BEGIN NOW “What’s your name?” She jumps the gun. END
BEGIN NOW You can leave any time.  END
BEGIN NOW You could run, your gut is screaming obscenities at you.  END
BEGIN NOW But you’re a cool guy.  END
BEGIN NOW You play it cool.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what you do.  END
BEGIN NOW So you give her your name and ask the same question.  END
BEGIN NOW She tilts her head again and exhales three syllables in your ear.  END
BEGIN NOW She taps out “Melinda” on the back of your hand.  END
BEGIN NOW The hair on your neck stands up.  END
BEGIN NOW Blood rushes down artery after artery, flushing your cheeks, swelling your cock a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW Your damn palms are so wet that little pools have formed on the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW You order some shots and two more mixed drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Her toes play on your ankle.  END
BEGIN NOW Her fingers dance on a highball glass, skating on the condensation.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t ask you for cigarettes anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes them and you let her.  END
BEGIN NOW You still have to light them.  END
BEGIN NOW Conversation tumbles along.  END
BEGIN NOW Small talk, bar talk.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing either of you will remember.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing of consequence.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember her name and two years of high school Spanish.  END
BEGIN NOW Me Linda.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m so pretty.  END
BEGIN NOW Very honest, sincerity in her name.  END
BEGIN NOW She asks you if you live around here but you’re just in town for business.  END
BEGIN NOW The company has set you up with a hotel room.  END
BEGIN NOW She asks you to call a cab and let’s get out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything she says sounds like a good idea.  END
BEGIN NOW You get in the cab after her, cupping and squeezing the mathematically precise curvature of her ass with your eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW In the alcohol fog you’ve forgotten something important.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a company card that paid for those drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW You might have to explain these expenditures to that waifish girl in accounting.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell did you do with that receipt? END
BEGIN NOW You wake up the next day, early in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW Alone in a sea of once crisp hotel sheets.  END
BEGIN NOW The receipt is on the night stand.  END
BEGIN NOW Right next to your checkbook. END
BEGIN NOW Part II END
BEGIN NOW Bare feet on a clean hardwood floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Comfy jeans and an oversized floppy sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW A well worn, hand-me-down couch.  END
BEGIN NOW Softly clad, sink in cushions; late afternoon television movies and one ashtray five butts deep on a small rectangle of coffee table.  END
BEGIN NOW Mug stains aptly placed in rings along the surface.  END
BEGIN NOW Melinda has earned a day of rest.  END
BEGIN NOW The check cleared; cash in hand.  END
BEGIN NOW Tax free rent money, food money, leisure money.  END
BEGIN NOW Melinda isn’t her real name.  END
BEGIN NOW And black isn’t her natural hair color.  END
BEGIN NOW She runs her fingers through her hair; scratches her scalp.  END
BEGIN NOW Scratches her itch and pulls a long drag from the cigarette between her middle and index fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW Flicks the ash and takes a swig from the tall can of beer in her other hand.  END
BEGIN NOW She won’t have to go out for a few nights now.  END
BEGIN NOW Nice score.  END
BEGIN NOW The month has been taken care of.  END
BEGIN NOW Next month means another bar across town, blonde hair and her name is Bonnie.  END
BEGIN NOW Next month means a short black skirt, Bing cherry red-purple lipstick and a manicure.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts her cigarette out and washes her mouth out with beer.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre mince words on the TV screen.  END
BEGIN NOW She should shower soon and get some breakfast.  END
BEGIN NOW She should buy some groceries and do the laundry.  END
BEGIN NOW Clean up the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Tidy things up a little.  END
BEGIN NOW A whole list of shoulds.  END
BEGIN NOW A list of shoulds that can wait until tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now the couch is nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now Mary Astor is inspiring her next night out.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to finish this beer before anything else.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to smoke again, before taking a shower.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a knock at the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Nelly opens it to see her land lady. END
BEGIN NOW “Hi Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW McConnell.” END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW McConnell stands slightly over five feet tall.  END
BEGIN NOW She wears tennis shoes, dirt stained, and a denim skirt all the way to the ankles.  END
BEGIN NOW She has on a knit wool cardigan, which she may have made herself.  END
BEGIN NOW Her rusty hair is naturally curly down just past her shoulders.  END
BEGIN NOW For the most part unkempt and unadorned.  END
BEGIN NOW She wears earrings made from sea shells and bracelets made from copper.  END
BEGIN NOW  There’s a necklace there, underneath all that wool.  END
BEGIN NOW Two bright green eyes, semi-wide, stare out from the barrage of her freckles.  END
BEGIN NOW Her lips move without the aid of lipstick. END
BEGIN NOW “Hello Nelly.” She pauses.  END
BEGIN NOW “You know, I was passing by your room just now and I thought to myself, ‘that balcony on 210 could really use some flowers.’ Do you like flowers?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t like forgiveness flowers, or wedding flowers, or funeral flowers.” END
BEGIN NOW “What about daises? Daises are such happy flowers.” END
BEGIN NOW “I like yellow roses most.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yellow roses?” END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm.  END
BEGIN NOW The color and smell.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re not over used or pretentious like other roses.  END
BEGIN NOW No one sends roses to someone just for being friends anymore.” END
BEGIN NOW “I bet boys send you flowers all the time.” END
BEGIN NOW “No, not really.” END
BEGIN NOW “Really? Not even your boyfriend?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t have a boyfriend, Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW McConnell.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess I’m between boyfriends right now.” For some five years or so.  END
BEGIN NOW Give or take. END
BEGIN NOW “Between boyfriends? That’s strange.  END
BEGIN NOW Although, now that I think about it, I never see you bring boys home.  END
BEGIN NOW Your apartment always seems so vacant.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t like to bring people over much.  END
BEGIN NOW Peace and quiet, you know.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, yes.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW But it seems strange for a girl your age.” She pauses.  END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t give up my dear.  END
BEGIN NOW Love is out there.”  A true believer.  END
BEGIN NOW A true believer that’s been divorced three times.  END
BEGIN NOW Face to face with the atheist of love.  END
BEGIN NOW The woman that murdered romance in cold blood.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice of the Me Generation.  END
BEGIN NOW Nelly tries not to laugh. END
BEGIN NOW “I have my doubts.” END
BEGIN NOW There’s an awkward pause.  END
BEGIN NOW The eyes of both parties dart about at details, never lingering. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, yes.  END
BEGIN NOW Nelly dear, it is the 8th…” END
BEGIN NOW “It is?” Now it’s Nelly’s turn to pause for second, trying to conjure up the significance of the 8th.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, right, right.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Hold on a sec.” She walks inside, rifles through her purse and produces a check. END
BEGIN NOW “Last month and this? Thank you for catching up so soon.” Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW McConnell looks the check over like she’s never seen one before. END
BEGIN NOW “I try.” END
BEGIN NOW “And do put some flowers on that balcony? It looks so lonesome.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll see what I can do.” END
BEGIN NOW The door closes and Nelly exhales through pouty, puckered lips.  END
BEGIN NOW She readjusts her hair, pulling her pony tail back.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks back to the coffee table, picks up her pack of cigarettes, extracts one and lights it.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits back down on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW Part III END
BEGIN NOW It took four outfits to get to this club.  END
BEGIN NOW It took the approval of two of your girlfriends.  END
BEGIN NOW The opinion of the third wasn’t terribly important.  END
BEGIN NOW It took three hours of changing hair, shoes, belts and bracelets.  END
BEGIN NOW Scrutinizing in front of the mirror.  END
BEGIN NOW Hair up, hair down.  END
BEGIN NOW Too much black, not enough.  END
BEGIN NOW It took time, effort, and collective opinion to even get your size zero ass out the door.  END
BEGIN NOW But here you are.  END
BEGIN NOW And you can’t hear a goddamn thing unless it’s shouted two inches from your ear.  END
BEGIN NOW Your friend with the sausage curls asks you to get some drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t pay for drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone else pays for your drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s your birthright.  END
BEGIN NOW You were born gorgeous.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is continually indebted to you for the privilege of gazing at you.  END
BEGIN NOW Some guy approaches your group.  END
BEGIN NOW He shouts, END
BEGIN NOW “Oh my God!” END
BEGIN NOW You turn and walk towards the bar, looking back every once in a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Your friends are laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy must be hilarious.  END
BEGIN NOW You get two drinks within five minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy at the bar said you have pretty eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He buys you and a friend all expense paid tickets to vodka and Redbull.  END
BEGIN NOW  Friends three and four are left out.  END
BEGIN NOW You go to the other end of the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re not a bitch; your ugly friends deserve drinks too.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that they’re ugly in the conventional sense.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just that you’re prettier.  END
BEGIN NOW The boys cat call you on the street.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re beautiful and everyone reminds you of this all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW  You see a guy three stools over from you, drinking alone.  END
BEGIN NOW But his clothes are nice.  END
BEGIN NOW You sit closer.  END
BEGIN NOW You bat your eye lashes and he blushes. END
BEGIN NOW Christ. END
BEGIN NOW You move a stool closer.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks down.  END
BEGIN NOW You throw a general comment out at this guy and look at your friends.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re laughing again.  END
BEGIN NOW That guy must be really entertaining.  END
BEGIN NOW Something interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Definitely not like the guy next to you. END
BEGIN NOW “You have nice eyes,” He says in shy voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Thank you so much.  END
BEGIN NOW You had no idea. END
BEGIN NOW He looks generous.  END
BEGIN NOW He offers to buy you a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW You say you need one for your friend as well.  END
BEGIN NOW He obliges.  END
BEGIN NOW What a tool.  END
BEGIN NOW Two more vodka Redbulls.  END
BEGIN NOW You say you have to use the restroom and never acknowledge his presence again.  END
BEGIN NOW Your friends are still talking to that guy.  END
BEGIN NOW Upon closer inspection he’s handsome, but not enough to make you nervous.  END
BEGIN NOW His nose is a little wide, he hasn’t shaved today.  END
BEGIN NOW His shirt is almost as loud as the music.  END
BEGIN NOW But his shoes are nice.  END
BEGIN NOW You say, interrupting him, END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell is going on?” Just under screaming volume, distributing drinks to your friends.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns slowly and looks at you END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus Christ, you can wait to talk.” And he turns back to your friends, “Who the fuck is that girl? Are you really friends with her?” END
BEGIN NOW Your friends giggle.  END
BEGIN NOW Your friends are laughing at the attention you’re not getting.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re laughing because Miss Popular just got cut down.  END
BEGIN NOW Nobody tells you when to speak.  END
BEGIN NOW Nobody tells you what to do.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to set this guy straight.  END
BEGIN NOW You take a big gulp of liquid courage, siphoned though a neon orange catch up stick.  END
BEGIN NOW “How do you all know each other?” The man asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, Kara and I met senior year,” your friend with the albino sausage curls starts, recounting the story of how your foursome came about.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s rambling and giggling.  END
BEGIN NOW She always rambles when she’s nervous.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s always nervous around boys when you’re all together.  END
BEGIN NOW You can see his eyes darting at you every once in a while, bored eyes searching for distraction.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s trying to be polite.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh man, you guys are like vultures in this place.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet you’re in here just to talk shit at all the stupid guys being pathetic, and the ugly girls with their pretentious faux chic shit.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys must be so fucking rad.” END
BEGIN NOW That’s all true, you think.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy with the loud voice and the loud shirt has basically got you nailed.  END
BEGIN NOW He can tell you know how to dress yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW That no expense was spared on your appearance.  END
BEGIN NOW That this outfit cost more than two months rent for a downtown loft.  END
BEGIN NOW “And you!” He shouts, facing you and holding your arms.  END
BEGIN NOW “I think I found the perfect guy for you.” END
BEGIN NOW He takes you and pushes you around the club.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re steered towards groups of guys standing around holding drinks up to their chests like shields made from ice and glass. END
BEGIN NOW “No, not that one, he’s too clean.  END
BEGIN NOW You need a bad boy, someone with tats and at least one missing tooth.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of his teeth should be yellow and cracked.  END
BEGIN NOW And he must! Must! Smell like he bathed in PBR!” END
BEGIN NOW You’re laughing and protesting, but not too much.  END
BEGIN NOW Your head is spinning and you realize that you haven’t had this much fun at a club in ages.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy just doesn’t care; he’s ready to throw you to some insane biker.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll throw you away like a jewel encrusted bone to a three legged junk yard dog.  END
BEGIN NOW Fearless.  END
BEGIN NOW Utterly offensive and fearless.  END
BEGIN NOW  He steers you outside to a balcony.  END
BEGIN NOW To a view of the city in lights.  END
BEGIN NOW “Fucking finally.  END
BEGIN NOW Fresh air.” He lights a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW “Got an extra one?” you ask. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t buy extras.  END
BEGIN NOW I plan on smoking them all.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you could earn one.  END
BEGIN NOW Prove to me that you deserve a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Prove to me that you’re worth more than four cents.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m very pretty.” You say defensively. END
BEGIN NOW “Boring! Beauty is common.  END
BEGIN NOW If pretty girls are a dime a dozen, that makes your net worth less than a penny.  END
BEGIN NOW Try harder.” He’s flaunting every smoky breath. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t have to try,” you say. END
BEGIN NOW “So you’re a spoiled little princess? Go buy your own.  END
BEGIN NOW I refuse to cater to whatever it is that you’re used to.” He smokes and looks out across the city.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d rather look at the city.  END
BEGIN NOW Something is very wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW “I can play the oboe,” you offer. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh? A musician are we? Well then, how long have you been playing?” END
BEGIN NOW “Since I was ten.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fantastic.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you like to play?” END
BEGIN NOW This is not a question you like to answer. END
BEGIN NOW “I’ve been playing classical in college for the last few years…” END
BEGIN NOW “But what do you like to play? What drives you? What about the oboe makes you want to play it?” END
BEGIN NOW You stammer.  END
BEGIN NOW Words start off your tongue but turn to mush before they leave your mouth. END
BEGIN NOW “So your parents got you started.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah,” you say. END
BEGIN NOW He gives you a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW “For effort.” He says, handing you a book of matches.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the city. END
BEGIN NOW You strike a match and watch the flame, making sure the stick catches before lighting up.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ve been neglecting your drink and this catches you by surprise.  END
BEGIN NOW The straw is between your lips and you suck deeply. END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell are you drinking anyway?” END
BEGIN NOW “Vodka Redbull.” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus, that sounds awful.  END
BEGIN NOW Like medicine.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever drink cough syrup?” he asks. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s not that bad! But I knew a guy in high school that drank cough syrup.  END
BEGIN NOW He said he talked to space aliens and then he got kicked out of class.” END
BEGIN NOW He turns and looks at you.  END
BEGIN NOW Every movement of his eyes evaluates your existence. END
BEGIN NOW “For some reason I thought I saw something in you.  END
BEGIN NOW Something different and interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Why are you in college?” END
BEGIN NOW “I, well, I’m studying for a degree in business.” END
BEGIN NOW “Great, just what the world needs now.” END
BEGIN NOW “There wasn’t a degree for Love, Sweet Love.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry to disappoint.” END
BEGIN NOW “A great failure of the university system, to be sure.” He shakes his head and looks at the city. END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell man! Who are you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Some guy, does it really matter?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes! Yes it matters.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t you know?” END
BEGIN NOW “Do you want a name? Is that what you need?” END
BEGIN NOW “A name would help, yes.” END
BEGIN NOW “Blake.  END
BEGIN NOW Does that work for you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Lindsey.” You shake his hand and he holds onto it.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks you in the eyes and holds your hand firmly, with your fingers interlocked.  END
BEGIN NOW “And who are you, Lindsey?” He smiles at you now, his eyes are soft and they shimmer. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m a business major that plays a very mechanical sounding oboe.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s just what you do.  END
BEGIN NOW Who, are, You?” He pokes you on the tip of your nose.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes dart from your left to your right eye and then your lips. END
BEGIN NOW “I, I.  END
BEGIN NOW I am...” His hand pulls you close from your waist.  END
BEGIN NOW Your lips touch his and your head is spinning.  END
BEGIN NOW The city lights, the breeze, the vodka and spinning.  END
BEGIN NOW Then release.  END
BEGIN NOW His merry-go-round mouth has sent you reeling.  END
BEGIN NOW The next few hours pass quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW Blake takes you out for a milkshake.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember laughing and hanging onto his every word.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember showing him your apartment, making a few drinks and putting a movie on.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t remember him leaving in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t remember him holding you and looking over your shoulder at the ATM.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t notice your card is missing until you try and pay for dinner later the next day. END
BEGIN NOW Part IV END
BEGIN NOW You’d be amazed how long someone can hit the snooze button.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d be even more amazed how many times a guy can miss the same button he’s been slapping for ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW Press button.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten more minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten more minutes is just enough to drift off to half sleep with heavy eyes until the noise starts again.  END
BEGIN NOW Rinse, lather repeat.  END
BEGIN NOW For hours.  END
BEGIN NOW The window is blocked by a blanket; the sheets are more like a nest.  END
BEGIN NOW There are some five pillows lying about unused.  END
BEGIN NOW Empty cans of Olympia litter the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Magazines and newspapers, personal ads.  END
BEGIN NOW Weeklies.  END
BEGIN NOW Ashtrays. END
BEGIN NOW Blake’s hand moves under covers, scratching his testicles.  END
BEGIN NOW He yawns and turns over, peeling his scrotum off his leg.  END
BEGIN NOW Blake isn’t his real name, neither is Byron.  END
BEGIN NOW One foot on the ground, another foot on the ground and he’s at least sitting up now.  END
BEGIN NOW He yawns again and thinks about brewing some coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW The thought is enough to get him out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW The living room is a couch and a TV.  END
BEGIN NOW A coffee table and a roommate that only moves his thumbs.  END
BEGIN NOW He says “Hey dude.” END
BEGIN NOW He says, “Hey dude.” END
BEGIN NOW In the kitchenette he rinses out the pot, fills a filter with grounds and presses the button.  END
BEGIN NOW The sounds of water heating, then dripping, then turning blacker by the drop into the pot and the smell that says good morning.  END
BEGIN NOW He could sit and wait until he has a cup ready.  END
BEGIN NOW A shit, shower and shave would get him half way to awake.  END
BEGIN NOW The water takes about ten minutes to heat up, just enough time to shit therapeutically.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t bother to whip his ass; the shower can take care of that without the thought of rubbing shit all over the place before it comes off on the paper.  END
BEGIN NOW He pushes a lever and everything goes away. END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes later Drake is clean from the bottom up.  END
BEGIN NOW Drake is the name his mother gave him, and sometimes it’s a good enough name to use.  END
BEGIN NOW He combs his hair, brushes his teeth and rinses out his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW A bath robe goes on, a cigarette in his mouth and he returns to the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee pot is already half empty.  END
BEGIN NOW The roommate moves his thumbs.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no coffee mug in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW The wrinkles in his clothes have collected dust.  END
BEGIN NOW The roommate’s beard is always the same length.  END
BEGIN NOW His face only changes expression from mild, detached apathy, to partial vexation. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey dude,” the roommate says, “Hey dude, have you ever, well, when’s the last time you shat on your own balls?” END
BEGIN NOW “Huh wha?” END
BEGIN NOW “You know like, maybe you’ve been drinking, and maybe your shit’s a bit on the watery to loose side of things, and maybe your sack just hangs a little lower that morning slash maybe afternoon, or maybe you wiped a little overzealously.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe you shat your pants and couldn’t deal immediately.  END
BEGIN NOW And while you were walking, running, whatever to deal with your problem, some shit got on your balls.  END
BEGIN NOW Or you know maybe you weren’t exactly shitting sitting down.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you were lying on your stomach and you shat yourself.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, on a scale of one to ten, that’s fucked up.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m fucking serious.” The roommate presses pause to emphasize his point. END
BEGIN NOW “Since when were you ever serious?” END
BEGIN NOW “On a scale of one to ten, I’m about seven point five on the serious scale.  END
BEGIN NOW Seven point five out of ten points of seriousness.” END
BEGIN NOW “Wow, you’ve never been that serious.” END
BEGIN NOW “Whatever, dude.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m always at least a four and then some.  END
BEGIN NOW I was a four and then some with your mom for like two months.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there was that one time when the power went out.  END
BEGIN NOW I was definitely off the serious scale then.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, point.” END
BEGIN NOW “No, no point dude; tell me about shitting on your balls.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why all this shit balls talk?” END
BEGIN NOW “No whys right now, just tell me about the last time you shat on your own balls.” END
BEGIN NOW “This is highly ridiculous.” END
BEGIN NOW “On a scale of one to ten, shitty balls could be the most important thing to ever happen to you.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re talking life changing experience here.” END
BEGIN NOW “You shat on your balls when you were a kid, didn’t you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Often.  END
BEGIN NOW Doing so saved me from doing some very unpleasant things.” END
BEGIN NOW “There are things less pleasant than shitting on your balls?” END
BEGIN NOW “Tons of things,” The roommate elaborates.  END
BEGIN NOW “So you’re six years old,” END
BEGIN NOW “No, you’re six years old.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t shit on my balls until I was at least twelve.” END
BEGIN NOW “Aha! Now we’re getting somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW So I was six years old and my grandparents are over.  END
BEGIN NOW Grandma smells like Listerine and Marlboro Lights, Granddad has a lazy eye and Mom is cooking dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m only six so all I ever do is sit in the living room with my hands in my lap wishing I were outside.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s awkward, I’m restless, and they’re talking and talking and talking.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t take it anymore, so I sat there and shat myself.” END
BEGIN NOW “How did that solve anything?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not finished.  END
BEGIN NOW Jump ahead two years.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sitting in class and I’m a runt.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no friends.  END
BEGIN NOW I have yet to discover the joys of my penis and we’re supposed to divide ourselves into groups for some stupid project that only eight years olds do.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted no part of the matter, so I shat my pants and squirmed in my seat, oozing shit all over my balls, the chair, it’s seeping through my pants, a girl screams and I’m off the hook.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude…” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m still not finished.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s more.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, on a scale of one to fucked up, this is really fucking twisted.” END
BEGIN NOW The roommate scratches his beard.  END
BEGIN NOW Particles fall into the crevices of his clothes. END
BEGIN NOW “The point of all of this, the point of this whole thing, is that shitting myself became an outlet for escape.  END
BEGIN NOW Whenever I needed to get out of a bad situation, I knew I could just crap my pants and squirm.  END
BEGIN NOW The trouble really began when I grew pubes.  END
BEGIN NOW Cleaning shit out of your pubes is a whole new aspect to the shitballs dilemma.  END
BEGIN NOW I like to think of the cleaning part is akin to the rebirth aspect of the Phoenix cycle.  END
BEGIN NOW Like how a phoenix dies in fire, and is reborn from the ashes.  END
BEGIN NOW I die in shit and am reborn in moist towellets.” END
BEGIN NOW “Your logic never cease to confuse and sicken me, dude.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, you just need to embrace shitballs logic.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not going to shit on my balls every time I might have to do something slightly unpleasant.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s so unnecessary.  END
BEGIN NOW I can deal.  END
BEGIN NOW I can hang.  END
BEGIN NOW I can accept my fate.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re just mistaking tolerance for acceptance.  END
BEGIN NOW You can affect change and avoid nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW Just relax your bowels and give a little push.  END
BEGIN NOW Give birth to the brown baby of selective action as opposed to passive fatalism.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’ve been thinking about this for a long time, haven’t you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Years, dude.  END
BEGIN NOW Years.” The roommate reflects on the ceiling, lost in memory. END
BEGIN NOW “Something else you should know about shitballs.  END
BEGIN NOW This came to me during Sunday school.  END
BEGIN NOW My parents were in Mass, and I’m sitting on a rug looking at big, dead Jesus, loin-clothed and just hanging around.  END
BEGIN NOW My older brother had informed me the previous night about how when someone dies, the last thing their body does is release the bowls.  END
BEGIN NOW Giving up the ghost, so to speak.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh Christ…” END
BEGIN NOW “Exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW So there I am in Sunday school, and father is droning on about sin and death and wages and Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m still thinking about shitting myself when I die, and then it occurs to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus died naked, with his ass against a cross.  END
BEGIN NOW When Jesus Christ shat on his cross, the shit had to push out around his ass; it had nowhere else to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Logically, it escaped between his legs, right onto his balls.  END
BEGIN NOW So you see, I’m not the only one that escapes things by shitting on my balls. END
BEGIN NOW “You didn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW You really did not just compare yourself to Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW That is by far the most roundabout, logic stretching, rambling diatribe you’ve ever subjected me to.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW Just fucking seriously I can’t believe anything I just heard.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, if you didn’t want to listen, all you had to do was shit your pants.” END
BEGIN NOW Part V END
BEGIN NOW Like most stories, this ends in a bar.  END
BEGIN NOW  The wooden bar top stretches along, doing what bar tops do.  END
BEGIN NOW The barflies drink expectedly.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartenders pour vodka drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW They pour beer, whiskey, gin, rum, and the occasional glass of wine.  END
BEGIN NOW They do all of this and grumble at meager tips.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like they’re making minimum wage.  END
BEGIN NOW The poor bastards.  END
BEGIN NOW The poor bitches.  END
BEGIN NOW The pitcher soaked patrons and everyone in between.  END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow night they’ll all be here again.  END
BEGIN NOW Some with familiar faces.  END
BEGIN NOW  Some fresh ones.  END
BEGIN NOW Fresh isn’t really the right word for this kind of bar.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a bar after all.  END
BEGIN NOW There are no surprises here.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially not the blond in a tight black dress.  END
BEGIN NOW You should have know she was going to be here the minute you opened the door. END
BEGIN NOW She looks around her and seems frustrated.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at you once or twice but always goes back to her drink.  END
BEGIN NOW Staring at the bottom of her glass with her head in a hand, with an elbow on the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at you like she’s really annoyed.  END
BEGIN NOW Her well manicured eyebrows angle in disgust.  END
BEGIN NOW Her lips tighten and curl into a fingerless fuck you.  END
BEGIN NOW The thing is, you haven’t done anything.  END
BEGIN NOW You just felt like a drink after a long day.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a little night cap.  END
BEGIN NOW Or an after work muscle relaxer.  END
BEGIN NOW A little something for the road.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not your problem and you’re not anyone’s problem.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just there.  END
BEGIN NOW That is entirely your fault. END
BEGIN NOW The door down stairs opens and closes.  END
BEGIN NOW A face comes up a flight, accentuated by aviator sunglasses and pomade.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just after midnight.  END
BEGIN NOW What a clown.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s dressed too well for this bar.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks around like he’s meeting someone here.  END
BEGIN NOW The blond has perked up.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her back straightens, she tidies her hair up a little.  END
BEGIN NOW The new arrival glances in her direction and takes a seat on the other end of the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW He orders old scotch and lights an imported cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He tips entirely too much and the bartender has already claimed the real estate closer to him.  END
BEGIN NOW Finally, a reason to have gone to work tonight. END
BEGIN NOW The blond gets up from her stool, takes her purse and coat and walks right behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets her coat brush against his back but makes no other acknowledgement of his existence.  END
BEGIN NOW She goes to use the ladies’ room.  END
BEGIN NOW She returns ten minutes later and the stranger hasn’t taken more than two sips.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits two stools away.  END
BEGIN NOW “A cigarette for a lady?” she asks. END
BEGIN NOW “No.” END
BEGIN NOW “No? What does that mean?” END
BEGIN NOW “It means you have been denied.” END
BEGIN NOW “You don’t have a spare?”  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs at her.  END
BEGIN NOW “And I suppose you want me to buy you drink too?” END
BEGIN NOW The girl looks confused.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t understand.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight is not her night. END
BEGIN NOW “Look, I’m sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I got started on the wrong foot.” END
BEGIN NOW “You were wrong well before you started walking over here.  END
BEGIN NOW Both times.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck man, what’s your problem?” END
BEGIN NOW “You left half a drink where you were sitting before, grab and come back over.  END
BEGIN NOW Then we can talk about my problem like civilized human beings.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh jesus…” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I’d say subtlety isn’t exactly your strong point.” END
BEGIN NOW The man waits a while while the girl fetches her beverage.  END
BEGIN NOW He sips his scotch slowly and inhales in between.  END
BEGIN NOW Fire water and fiery air.  END
BEGIN NOW Earthy tobacco on fire and now nothing but smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits down again with a drink in hand.  END
BEGIN NOW A drink to lips and down the hatch and now nothing but an empty glass. END
BEGIN NOW “So about that drink you were going to buy me…” But he just laughs at her again.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a loud laugh, or really, even a mirthful one.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a little chuckle that reminds her that he’s no fool.  END
BEGIN NOW She can try and trick him, but he’s not going to fall for it.  END
BEGIN NOW And if he’s even a little nice to her, it will be on his own terms.  END
BEGIN NOW She calls the bartender over. END
BEGIN NOW “Three wise men on the rocks.  END
BEGIN NOW And another straight up.” END
BEGIN NOW “Are you trying to get me drunk?” he asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes.” She says, “Yes I am.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fair enough, honesty appreciated and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW But what brings you here? Why this bar on this night?” END
BEGIN NOW “Thought I was meeting someone.  END
BEGIN NOW Thought it was going to be a good night.  END
BEGIN NOW Haven’t met anyone but a handful of losers and stereotypes so far.  END
BEGIN NOW This bar may be a joke.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t decided yet.  END
BEGIN NOW The jukebox is decent enough.” END
BEGIN NOW “The jukebox hasn’t been changed in twenty years.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither have the patrons.” END
BEGIN NOW “You really don’t expect me to believe you’ve been going to this bar for twenty years, you’re what? Twenty seven? END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty five.  END
BEGIN NOW Give or take.” END
BEGIN NOW “So you’ve been going to this bar for four years at most? Maybe a few more if you’re clever.” END
BEGIN NOW “Actually, this is my first time.  END
BEGIN NOW Expecting a larger turn out.  END
BEGIN NOW How disappointing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I don’t know about you yet.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just another face as of right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me something to go on.” END
BEGIN NOW “Like what? ‘Oh hello sir, I’m a lost little girl in the big city with all my hopes and dreams in a row… Just hoping to meet some new friends…’” She shifts her pitch up an octave to emphasize innocence. END
BEGIN NOW “Trite.  END
BEGIN NOW Trite but effective.  END
BEGIN NOW No, you can’t get to know someone in a sentence.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s begin with introductions,  ames and all that.” He extends a hand and waits.  END
BEGIN NOW She hesitates, looking at him a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW Then her hand meets his and they both wait for the other to start. END
BEGIN NOW “…Nelly…” She says, drawing every bit out. END
BEGIN NOW “…Drake…” he says, feeling no need for the first time in a while to hide behind a moniker.  END
BEGIN NOW The way they say their own names as if they are strangers shaking hands with the image in a mirror.  END
BEGIN NOW Uncomfortable with the syllables that emcompass inherited labels.  END
BEGIN NOW For a while they both frown at something off to the side.  END
BEGIN NOW Then remembering that, hey I was about to start a conversation with a stranger… END
BEGIN NOW “So… Nelly… who was this dude you were so set on metting?  Boyfriend? Husband? Business?” END
BEGIN NOW “Um, business.” She answers skittishly.  END
BEGIN NOW “What about you? You stand out at this place like a clean shave at a ZZ Top concert.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell brought you here? To drink old scotch and smoke expensive cigarettes?” END
BEGIN NOW “I was, uh, supposed to meet up, with a friend… She must be running late.” END
BEGIN NOW “Uh huh.  END
BEGIN NOW Isn’t she always?” END
BEGIN NOW “No sense of time.  END
BEGIN NOW Bitch needs a watch.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, a bitch is she? When do I get to meet her? We might have something in common.” END
BEGIN NOW “Maybe later.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe if she’s not going to be a flake tonight.” END
BEGIN NOW “Waiting on a flake? That sounds like a perfect night.  END
BEGIN NOW How’d you meet her?” END
BEGIN NOW “Personal ads.  END
BEGIN NOW Single White Female seeks scotch drinking deviant for evening of folly.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.” END
BEGIN NOW “And you responded? You actually took her up on that?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well sure, I mean, why not? I can drink scotch.” END
BEGIN NOW “Slowly, but obviously.” END
BEGIN NOW “Besides, she’s Irish.” END
BEGIN NOW “How do you know that? You haven’t met her yet.” END
BEGIN NOW “Because she’s late.” He says taking a longer sip than usual. END
BEGIN NOW 	The outside of The Afternoon is all tables and umbrellas, café seating for about fifteen.  END
BEGIN NOW White furniture; whicker chairs and glass tables.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a neon open sign, on until midnight, down and to the left of a hand-painted welcome sign; and The Afternoon painted in letters made from clouds.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a stage in the corner, and a small shelf of books on the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW Notebooks and pens, some basic art supplies can be purchased in a tiny shop, opposite corner of the stage.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar stretches along the opposite wall from the door, heavy oak top, well polished and worn from use.  END
BEGIN NOW Stools, floor bolted in a row of seven sit with enough room for your feet to dangle.  END
BEGIN NOW  No two of the tables on the floor is the same, or any chair with a twin.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of it was salvaged, lots of here and there stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie restored some of them and let the others proudly show their age. END
BEGIN NOW 	Jolie Praddle rebuilt this place damn near from the ground up.  END
BEGIN NOW Used to be an antique shop, all dust and neglect; grandfather clocks and rocking chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie wanted a scene; neurotics and genius intermingle within her walls.  END
BEGIN NOW She wanted talent to surround her, a mother hen to the few consumed by creative drive.  END
BEGIN NOW She has the apartment upstairs, which is more of a warehouse.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a museum.  END
BEGIN NOW She has her instruments, the flute and cello, and a Steinway against the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW There are paintings, framed and stacked, a few are hung up.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll rotate them later this month.  END
BEGIN NOW She has her first composition hung next to her BA in music theory.  END
BEGIN NOW On the floor and a few shelves are stacks of LPs, all kinds of stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW A turntable, neatly cleaned and dusted, cared for and frequently used rests on a small table; there’s a Joan Baez record on there now. END
BEGIN NOW 	The place smells like tea, toast and butter.  END
BEGIN NOW She usually keeps a kettle on the stove.  END
BEGIN NOW She picks loose-leaf teas expertly and has them all in glass jars on the shelf above the range.  END
BEGIN NOW Labeled, with notes about each flavor.  END
BEGIN NOW And a little strainer filters them.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits in front of the coffee table, thumbing through a book of water color landscapes.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s looking for something spring time, something new and wet and bursting.  END
BEGIN NOW Her kettle sings again and she sets the book down, marking her place with a note pad.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The kettle is removed from the heat, lid open to let a bit of steam out.  END
BEGIN NOW The strainer is set with a few cups worth of an orange mint tea, floral with a citrus finish.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets is steep for a few minutes, bobbing the tea up and down in the rapidly coloring water.  END
BEGIN NOW The shade grows deeper with every dip, until it’s just right.  END
BEGIN NOW The cup is left on the counter until it’s cool enough to touch.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie gets her slippers and a robe, walking down the steps into the back room of The Afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks on the lights and sets the thermostat.  END
BEGIN NOW The small kitchen hums to life.  END
BEGIN NOW She turns the brewers and the grinders on, the ovens, but not the sign just yet.  END
BEGIN NOW She unlocks the front door and picks up the newspapers, turns and relocks the door.  END
BEGIN NOW She sets a stack in a stand for anyone that needs something to read.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes one back with her up the stairs and fetches her tea cup.  END
BEGIN NOW 	She sips after blowing over the surface sending steam clouds rolling upward, taking in slow the hot tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Feeling warmer in the morning cool with every bit more.  END
BEGIN NOW She scans the headlines, the weather, the comics.  END
BEGIN NOW An old habit to check the obituaries, just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW She reads her horoscope but doesn’t believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a slow news day and she takes a shower.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands in front of the mirror, now clean, brushing her dark, red hair and studying her naked form.  END
BEGIN NOW Never satisfied and always drawn to flaws.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face wrinkles and frowns, eyes meeting eyes in the mirror and crossed now, she sticks out her tongue giggling.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re not so bad, really,” she tells her reflection.  END
BEGIN NOW 	In the closet Jolie finds a blouse and a pair of jeans, she pulls underwear and a bra from the chest of drawers adjacent.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts everything on, slow and tired and careful.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls her long red hair into a pony tail, gives one last check in the mirror, straightening the edges of her shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW She heads back down the stairs, stepping lightly on each of the twenty-four steps and hears the back door open. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Mornin’ Jolie.” It’s Iris. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hey kid, how’s it going?” Yawning big mouthed, steady and holding her tea cup. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Ah man, it’s so cold this morning, woke up with Leviathan still one-twenty deep and my glasses crooked again.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m never going to finish Hobbes, he’s so dry.” Iris Celestiene has been spending the last few of her sixteen years going over major works in western philosophy.  END
BEGIN NOW Her book shelves at home are lined with paperbacks, spines all bent to hell, pages creased in the corners marking previous pausing points, making everything a little thicker.  END
BEGIN NOW This is her thing.  END
BEGIN NOW She collects ideas.  END
BEGIN NOW During the days when she’s not finishing school work she bakes and works the register.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hobbes is pretty thick reading,” Jolie says.  END
BEGIN NOW Having spent college wrapped up in music theory, she still managed to take enough philosophy to pretend she can follow the conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW “So before you get started, we’re going to need a batch of cinnamon rolls and croissants, maybe some raspberry scones, just to be safe.” As she wakes up, caffeine hitting in all the right places, her voice carries a slight sing-song rhythm.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“’Kay, I’ll get on it.” Iris is thumbing through a book of CDs, looking for The Violent Femmes.  END
BEGIN NOW She checks the oven temperatures; pulls the ball of puff pastry dough from the cooler and sets it on the three by four hardwood board resting on an island in the middle of the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Surrounded by stainless steel reflections, distortions from dents set by previous owners; She mixes the frostings, the blend of sugar and cinnamon, chocolate and chili.  END
BEGIN NOW She rolls the dough out for the buns and scones, rolls the puff pastry into sheets which she brushes with melted butter.  END
BEGIN NOW Her brush works up down, up down; she can smell the butter, and she’s humming American Music.  END
BEGIN NOW She cuts off a square, folds it into a crescent and places it with care into the fiery furnace.  END
BEGIN NOW We cannot readily stress the importance of careful quality control, these things are very important.  END
BEGIN NOW Without these rigorous tests, without checking everything with strong discretion, without calculated and careful consumption of all these delicious doughy delicacies.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, without all that the whole thing wouldn’t be worth a shit now would it? She knows with no small degree of certainty that the croissants will be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW However, hunger dictates that a little fresh pastry never hurt anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Most important meal of the day and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW Hard to beat fresh baked anything at this hour.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Jolie calls back, “Oh! And we’re going to need couple of quiche.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s some fresh chives and lardons in the cooler.” Quiche makes everything better.  END
BEGIN NOW Still she’s got quite a list before opening and inhales the remainder of the croissant, trying to savor what she can of the sweet, flakey pastry.  END
BEGIN NOW All buttery and consistent light crunch, crunch to dissolve on the tongue.  END
BEGIN NOW She switches out the CD for some Social Distortion, picking up the pace and folding croissants with mad, feverish fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW Sheet pans hit racks to cool, the whole place smells of fresh breads and sweets.  END
BEGIN NOW She prepares lemon custard, whisking the yolks and sugar, lemon juice, honey and cream.  END
BEGIN NOW She steams a cup of milk and honey, sipping sporadically with dough crusted fingers and all-purpose flour speckled face.  END
BEGIN NOW Her short mocha colored, slightly curly hair is hidden under a blue and black bandana.  END
BEGIN NOW She sings to herself, “…She never seemed to notice that this silly, school boy crush, wasn’t just pretend.” Voice dropping to comically low levels for the background vocals.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The timer on the wall begins beeping rapidly, meaning the cinnamon rolls are ready to cool.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls them and puts the pan on a cooling rack, where they will wait until optimal temperatures for the spreading of sweet cream frostings.  END
BEGIN NOW She double checks the sweetness, making sure all the flavors are there.  END
BEGIN NOW She drops cookie dough with a two ounce scoop onto a greased pan, watching them bake and rise.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Jolie turns on the sound system in the front and checks all the tables and chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a head poking around out front, silhouetted by the now risen sun. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Fifteen minutes, and we’ve got a head out front!”  END
BEGIN NOW 	She curses people with watches set fast and gives the place a quick double check, makes sure the brewers are full, plenty of cups and mugs.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks to the front, flicks on the sign and unlocks the door.  END
BEGIN NOW The man that was hanging about the front door enters and the bell rings.  END
BEGIN NOW He says good morning and walks up to the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie’s seen him a few times before, one of those early risers.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s married by the ring on his finger and has a picture of two children in his wallet.  END
BEGIN NOW He orders a large vanilla latte and a sesame seed bagel with cream cheese, toasted, please.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s dressed in well worn blue jeans and sandals.  END
BEGIN NOW His blue shirt marks the anniversary of some blues festival.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s balding like a fryer; he wears a thick brown-black moustache with salt and pepper overtones.  END
BEGIN NOW He drives a green Subaru, parked a block away.  END
BEGIN NOW As Jolie takes the cash she notes his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Scars and black-blue thumb nails, hammer struck a few days previous.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Jolie steams the milk, pours in a double shot of espresso and a shot of vanilla syrup.  END
BEGIN NOW She leaves the lid off and places the cup on the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW The bagel halves slide off the toaster oven and she picks them up.  END
BEGIN NOW Plain cream cheese spatula spread, thick and rich.  END
BEGIN NOW She presses the halves together and slides it into a paper sleeve.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Thanks again,” Jolie says handing it to him. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Have a nice day,” the man says, looking into her green eyes and taking a big sip, leaving foam traces between the hairs on his lip.  END
BEGIN NOW He licks them off and walks to the door.  END
BEGIN NOW “Who was that?” Iris yells over two songs simultaneously from deep in the heart of the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Moustache guy,” Jolie replies over Even in Blackouts and Simon and Garfunkel.  END
BEGIN NOW 	It starts soon afterward, the mad rush of slow, soon to be woken citizens looking for a little warm something.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a light breakfast.  END
BEGIN NOW Something sweet maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Iris is cranking up the radio now, breaking a sweat- now bobbing and kneading with reckless abandon.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s making muffins to the sounds of Minus the Bear.  END
BEGIN NOW Her fingers working in the flour furiously.  END
BEGIN NOW She pushes her glasses up her nose, leaving white finger prints.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls sheet pans of gooey hot cookies from the ovens pitching them on cooling racks; Pulls no bake cookies from the cooler, placing them with care into a basket and running them up to the front display case.  END
BEGIN NOW Switching out the old one and munching on the broken bits still left at the bottom.  END
BEGIN NOW She throws the linen liner into another basket, later to be laundered.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lull for fifteen minutes and Jolie steps out back for a smoke, leaving Iris register bound. END
BEGIN NOW 	Behind the Afternoon is all dumpster and recycling bins.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a couch and a butt can placed there for the same purpose to which Jolie has now occupied herself.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside the phone will ring in about ten minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now she’s inhaling slowly, pulling at the spark on the tip of tabacco.  END
BEGIN NOW Watching the paper burn and turn into carbon and smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW She feels it fall into her lungs, closes her eyes and lets it escape out of the mouth and nostrils.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks the ash carelessly and sighs.  END
BEGIN NOW She could use a sandwich in a minute, something warm.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe toasted foccacia bread with sun dried tomatoes, red onions and swiss cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe roast beef, maybe roasted turkey.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a lot of maybes today.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks off the end, sending a finger crushed butt can-ward.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Iris is settling the syrups in the cabinet, keeping things in order.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“I was thinking about getting some sandwiches from down the street, want anything?”  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hell yeah! I could totally go for a reuben right about now, yeah, thanks.” Iris pushes her glasses up and brushes her bangs out of her face.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“’Kay, be back in a few.” The bell on the door rings. END
BEGIN NOW 	Iris watches her leave and wrinkles her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes the opportunity to change out the classic rock for something a little more modern.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a burned copy of Bloc Party’s debut album and sets it on the CD tray.  END
BEGIN NOW The first track comes on in a cascade of squeeling guitars; drums, pounding and thumping and crashing all around.  END
BEGIN NOW She hits on the rhythm and restocks for the slow few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Sets more napkins in the dispenser, wipes down the counter, brings more cups from the back, and satisfying the occasional customer.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie returns with a brown paper bag; within the sandwiches.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a local weekly tucked under one arm.  END
BEGIN NOW The sandwiches come out of the bag and on to the counter top along with the paper.  END
BEGIN NOW She sorts out whose is whose and they drink a chai tea together.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Dad called while you were out,” says Iris between mouthfuls.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Oh? And what was he up to?” says Jolie in half chewed words. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Wants to know if you want to meet up at that Greek place downtown to discuss the new gallery show.” Iris clenses her palette and rinses bread crumbs from between her teeth with the warm tea.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Awesome, now I get two lunches.” Wonder where I’m going to put it all. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Well, then I’m taking a break while I can.  END
BEGIN NOW Got a smoke I can bum?” Iris is trying to sound mature enough to convince her.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“You know where they are,” She raises an eyebrow.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Iris gives her a look like, thanks for the guilt trip mom.  END
BEGIN NOW I may not be legally entitled to this pleasure, but it’s not unfamiliar; it’s a comfort thing, it’s a mature thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck never guilts her for bumming smokes, even buys her a pack from time to time.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck also can’t say no to pretty girls, regardless of blood ties.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d probably be by later; he almost always stops in, if only for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW She grabs Leviathan on her way out back, bookmark unshifted from her previous attempts to gain a few pages the night before.  END
BEGIN NOW She flops on the couch, and sparks the bright green bic always in her pocket, bringing the flame towards her face and sucks the heat into the delicate white cylinder.  END
BEGIN NOW She cracks open the book and traces her free finger to her last paragraph, blowing smoke down between the pages.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Through the front door in walks a leg followed by another, jean clad and moving with all the grace of a dedicated pedestrian.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottoms of his shoes are well worn from constant concrete caresses.  END
BEGIN NOW The shoes themselves used to be a light brown, but weather and elements have taken their toll, making things a few shades dark with dirt.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a black hooded sweater, ripped slightly at the neck, cord removed soon after purchase, rips in the cuffs soon afterward, mostly by accident.  END
BEGIN NOW The zipper is half way down to his stomach and he wears a simple red t-shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW His face is clean shaven, his dark brown hair clean and short.  END
BEGIN NOW His large brown eyes a little blurry and scanning the room for familiar faces.  END
BEGIN NOW He spies Jolie at the register who looks up at him as the bells clang against the door.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hey Duck, right on time.” She’s warm and this is very routine.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Hey beautiful, how’s business?” He’s all smiles, eyes and all.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Usual weekday nonsense, what are you up to? Chronic lay-about that you are,” She says in slight rib jabbing tones.  END
BEGIN NOW Sympathetic to the lazy artist.  END
BEGIN NOW All the creativity and only half the drive.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Gathering inspiration, admiring my muses.” Meaning he’s stoned and checking out chicks.  END
BEGIN NOW Red eyes revealing everything in between the words.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“How’s Liz doing?” Not the most eager of subjects, but these things must be discussed.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“I dunno man, she’s getting all distant on me.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t get it, she’d just rather sit around the house, doped up and watching Dr.  END
BEGIN NOW Phil and Oprah.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Is she still living with her parents? How old is she?” END
BEGIN NOW 	He sighs, “Twenty-two by birth, about fifteen by action.” He’s already painted a negative picture, facing an unpleasant inevitability.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes a face.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“So, my uncle said something about a gallery show later this month, have you seen what he’s been working on?” Change the subject, let’s not dwell on the unpleasentries. END
BEGIN NOW 	“First I heard of it was this morning, Iris said he called earlier, speaking of, need to call him back, do me a favor and fetch Iris out back, could you two mind the place for a while?” Duck isn’t technically employed, but he knows the place.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“I can do that, I’ll bring her up.” He walks through the kitchen, eyeing the stereo that’s run out of CD to play.  END
BEGIN NOW He pushes open the back door and gives it a shave and a hair cut.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“’Sup Cous?” He says it to sedate after the startling knock that snapped her out of a literary trance.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Duck!” She leaps up and gives him a hug.  END
BEGIN NOW “How’s yourself?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Oh, you know, waking up, kinda.  END
BEGIN NOW Jolie needs us to get inside and watch things while she goes out with your dad.  END
BEGIN NOW Scandalous behavior, I expect nothing less from those two.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Please, Dad’s not like that, you think everyone’s fucking on the side.” She’s trying to give him a look. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Well, they should be.” Pausing between, “I’m kidding, you know I don’t think that, and besides, I love your mom way too much to wish that upon her.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“You love everyone’s mom, you dirty little whore.” She punches him in the arm. END
BEGIN NOW 	“I get around.” But not really. END
BEGIN NOW 	He holds the door open for her and closes it softly behind them.  END
BEGIN NOW He watches her move across the kitchen floor, almost bouncy.  END
BEGIN NOW He goes to the radio and finds something to put on.  END
BEGIN NOW The case is well worn and has seen a bit of travel.  END
BEGIN NOW He leafs over everything once and works his way backwords.  END
BEGIN NOW An idea occurs to him and he reaches into the bookbag at his side, purducing a CD case of his own.  END
BEGIN NOW He opens it to the back and pulls a freshly burned mix of Beatles songs.  END
BEGIN NOW The disc spins to life and the first pluckings of Blackbird dirft and reflect off the ovens and tables and utensils and make their way out to the register. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Oh, do bring that up here, let’s put it on the main system.” END
BEGIN NOW 	Jolie nods at the idea and gathers her keys and purse.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Call Cyril if you need anything.  END
BEGIN NOW And Duck, help yourself to a scone or something.  END
BEGIN NOW Just don’t burn the place down.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“I think we can manage,” Iris says. END
BEGIN NOW 	They watch her leave.  END
BEGIN NOW Duck pours himself a cup of coffee and looks at the pastries.  END
BEGIN NOW All the golden brown, the rich chocolates and creams.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“I’ll find something in the back,” He says and walks over to the island. END
BEGIN NOW 	A customer walks in and puts his backpack on a couch.  END
BEGIN NOW He pushes sandy blonde bangs from his forehead, exhailing, eyeing the menu, uncertain.  END
BEGIN NOW His weight moves from foot to foor, still undecided.  END
BEGIN NOW A look of impatience crosses Iris’s face, she instigates, END
BEGIN NOW 	“Can I help you?” she says. END
BEGIN NOW 	“I hope so,” he says.  END
BEGIN NOW “I can’t have dairy or nuts, do you have anything to eat that won’t kill me?” END
BEGIN NOW 	“We have vegan brownies and muffins, but they’re no where near as good as the real thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Also the ginger cookies and lemon drops should be alright.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Soy or rice milk?” he inquires. END
BEGIN NOW 	“For coffee? Either or.” Picky picky, I doubt it would kill him anyways. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Soy latte then, easy on the foam.” I expect nothing less. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Sure thing, it’ll be a minute.” END
BEGIN NOW 	Duck is puttering around the kitchen looking for odds and ends and loose bits to make some semblance of a meal out of.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears the conversation at the counter and shakes his head.  END
BEGIN NOW These people, he thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW These people are going to be the death of decent eating.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears a rap at the back door and sees a week past shaven head poke in, hand still knocking on the wood. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Motherfucker.” Duck says, shaking his head. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Duck man, sup? You stuck here?” He let’s himself in a few more feet and slaps palms against Duck’s, tapping knuckles white in fist form on the follow up. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Yeah for a few, Jolie had to step out and lunch with my uncle.  END
BEGIN NOW Dunno when she’s getting back, could take a while.” This won’t do at all. END
BEGIN NOW 	“That’s no good man, you should run with me to Gypsy’s place for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW You think Iris can handle things for fifteen?” This is Shea Digit.  END
BEGIN NOW He is before all things a buisness man.  END
BEGIN NOW He is, directly after that, completely out of touch with the notion of time and scheduale.  END
BEGIN NOW He is after all, a drug dealer.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s life on the hustle.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“I dunno man, lemme check.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think it’ll be a problem.”  END
BEGIN NOW 	The main stretch of town is mostly restaurants, banks, cafes, small window shops, a salon or two.  END
BEGIN NOW A clock on the side of the First National reads three-thirty and a scrolling banner reads seventy two degrees.  END
BEGIN NOW You could say it’s mostly cloudy.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside one of these banks a teller is handing over a loan form on yellow paper.  END
BEGIN NOW She slides it through the window with a blue plastic pen with the banks name printed on it.  END
BEGIN NOW She says to come back when this is filled out and the lady at desk to the right will take care of it.  END
BEGIN NOW She gives a quick nod to the next person in line, signaling that it’s their turn now, and off you go ma’m, have a nice day but please don’t stay because I’m really close to my lunch break, but I need to deal with the last two people in this line and yes, someone else can assist you with that if you have any questions.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name tag says Trisha and her hair is straight, strawberries and cream blonde.  END
BEGIN NOW The woman she was assisting takes a seat in this black leather lounge chair with wooden legs, stained a deep red brick brown.  END
BEGIN NOW Now seated, she crosses her thin legs, idly tapping her shoes together.  END
BEGIN NOW The shoes are brown, but more like auburn brown.  END
BEGIN NOW She had her solid chestnut hair cut recently for the weather, shoulder length, bouncy, easy to manage.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s dressed in jeans and a short sleeve t-shirt she found at a thrift store.  END
BEGIN NOW The shirt advertises a freight company that went out of business when she was seven.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a book to set the paper on in her lap, so the pen doesn’t poke through, forcing her to deal with that bitchy girl at the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW She almost wants to get back in line, but really she has better things to do.  END
BEGIN NOW The money from this loan is going to pay for a new exhaust hood.  END
BEGIN NOW She brushes the hair out of her face and exhales loudly, like a sigh, but more breathy.  END
BEGIN NOW She frowns at the teller, wrinkles her nose and starts at the top of the page.  END
BEGIN NOW The basic information goes down quickly, name address, account numbers, amount needed.  END
BEGIN NOW She stares at the words Rachael Vox and thinks hey that’s me.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks over the address and everything is in order.  END
BEGIN NOW She double checks the numbers, gives it one final look and walks to the lady at the loan desk, handing her the sheet all caution tape yellow in hue. END
BEGIN NOW 	The immediate firsts are her bitch face.  END
BEGIN NOW Her glasses on a chain being pushed to her sharp bitch nose, her make-up caked face, the mole on her chin with a stray hair poking out.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hideous mauve and orange circa nineteen seventies power suit coat and an equally hideous lime green blouse.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s probably around forty-five, but her makeup adds ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name tag reads Hilda, but it’s short for Hildegard.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael extends an arm lead by a hand in a gesture of greeting; with airs of we are here to discuss business matters, specifically my desperate financial situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael can feel the soft pack of Luckies burning a hole in her pocket and she fiddles with the pen nervously.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “Hi, I’m Rachael and I need a loan.” END
BEGIN NOW 	Hilda, short for Hildegard says, I can read that, thanks, have a seat but you’re already sitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely ignoring the extended hand.  END
BEGIN NOW She glances over the paper, sees St.  END
BEGIN NOW Helena’s Soup Kitchen, and raises an eyebrow.  END
BEGIN NOW She coughs and taps a pen on the desk, lots of hmmms and I sees.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael reads one of her business cards for the fifth time, trying not to read Hilda’s bitch face, trying not to exude loathing.  END
BEGIN NOW And Hilda, short for Hildegard looks up at the pretty girl in front of her, with her still skinny legs well clad in those jeans, her thin frame and pert conservative bust.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hips that haven’t passed a child.  END
BEGIN NOW She follows up to her pleasant face, lacking in age lines, and save for a few wrinkles on her brow.  END
BEGIN NOW She follows her bright green eyes and freshly trimmed brunette hair, her cute as a button nose.  END
BEGIN NOW Her ringless fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW Her twenty dollar department store wrist watch.  END
BEGIN NOW Her skepticism from the canary yellow document has changed to envy of her looks and glaring disapproval of her unmarried twenty-five year old finger.  END
BEGIN NOW She readjusts her glasses, then removes them.  END
BEGIN NOW Sighs looking downward and face still down looks straight ahead at the now hussy in front of her.  END
BEGIN NOW This young woman, this young woman that needs a loan for an exhaust hood so she can cook soup for vagrants and bums.  END
BEGIN NOW This pretty little tart that doesn’t have a man to take care of her, this dirty trampslutbitch that doesn’t live her life properly.  END
BEGIN NOW This unstructured harlot, looking for a loan she can no doubt not pay back any time soon.  END
BEGIN NOW This uppity self righteous whore that leeches off the charity of others.  END
BEGIN NOW And Hilda short for Hildegard excuses herself for a minute, she needs to check on something with her supervisor.  END
BEGIN NOW And Rachael knows what this means.  END
BEGIN NOW She jumps up and across the desk, laying her hands around her fat neck, over the gaudy necklaces and gripping the thick bull fat neck of the bitch in front of her.  END
BEGIN NOW The skin envelopes her fingers, folding over her hands.  END
BEGIN NOW She wrings her like a gym towel screaming and shouting, watching her flail about, the undulating waves of cellulite start from the swinging mass of her underarms.  END
BEGIN NOW Her green eyes flash fire, she breathes brimstone and smoldering seventh circle smoke exits her nose END
BEGIN NOW 	STUPID FAT FUCKING BITCH FUCK YOU (gargling noises) FUCK YOU FUCK YOU ITS ONLY MONEY ITS FOR A MISSON HOUSE (her veiny blue face stares ahead with the underside whites of her eyes) I HAVE PEOPLE THAT NEED ME I HAVE PEOPLE THAT RELY ON ME JUST (Rachael takes a hand off and slaps her hard across the face) BECAUSE (slap) YOU (slap) HATE (slap) POOR PEOPLE (her pudgy pepper pot body shudders violently) FUCK YOU. END
BEGIN NOW And Hilda (short for Hildegard) returns and says, sorry but we can’t process this at the moment, I’m afraid without the proper collateral or some kind of guarantee of payments END
BEGIN NOW 	And Rachael has already pushed open the glass swinging doors with her fists clenched and reached for her cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Under her breath she exhales “That fucking bitch-ass cunt motherfucker.” Guilt sets in as the syllables form off her lips and tongue.  END
BEGIN NOW She mutters more curses and inhales the nicotine to the bottom of her lungs.  END
BEGIN NOW The smoke absorbs into her tissues, her blood stream, hits her central nervous system, her body sighs in relief and she curses again.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at her phone and selects the Skeez’s number, not dialing yet.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking it’s time for a cup of coffee before she resumes her hunt for funds.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking a cup of coffee and half this pack of smokes sounds really good right now.  END
BEGIN NOW The sky is overcast and it’s about fifty-six degrees, give or take.  END
BEGIN NOW Her twenty dollar department store wrist watch reads four in the afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW 	She flicks ash off the cherry and starts walking down the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW One way traffic passes her by, a city bus, two mini-vans, a station wagon and a Chrysler truck lifted several inches.  END
BEGIN NOW A maroon sedan with a dent in the bumper waits at the corner, turning signal blinking in anticipation of an opening.  END
BEGIN NOW In the spaces between buildings light creeps over and through cracks, steel and concrete canyons, brick and mortar monoliths.  END
BEGIN NOW Their shadows pale from the homogenous spread of sunlight over cloud cover.  END
BEGIN NOW A breeze picks up and Rachael shivers, cursing her sweater neglected in the closet, her lack of foresight; a newspaper on the desk containing forecasts predicting recent weather changes.  END
BEGIN NOW But she hasn’t grasped that yet.  END
BEGIN NOW She ducks in an alley, shielded from the wind, rising steadily to gusts.  END
BEGIN NOW  She looks down at her chest self consciously and god damnit.  END
BEGIN NOW The hairs on her neck and arms stand up; a chill runs down her spine.  END
BEGIN NOW She switches her cigarette hand, warming the previous one back up under her arm.  END
BEGIN NOW Waits for it, and heads back to the sidewalk, arms across her chest, half a cigarette hanging out of the corner of her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She watches her feet move forward, starts counting the steps.  END
BEGIN NOW The Afternoon sits a few blocks ahead, brick and mortar; two stories tall, right on the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW The open sign glows iridescent behind the glass of the door.  END
BEGIN NOW And two hundred sixty-five, two hundred sixty-six… The door swings open and out, pushed by these two guys rough around the edges, with shallow, paranoid sunken eyes, unkempt and weary looking.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael pauses to flick the butt into the street and waits for these guys to move away from the door.  END
BEGIN NOW 	The inside lights hit her blinking; retinal adjustments.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound system sends vibrations that bounce off ear drums sending a signal, firing synapses to tell you that this is Here Comes The Sun by The Beatles.  END
BEGIN NOW An aroma of roasted beans floats over the tables, the chairs, and half a dozen bodies, seated or browsing, reading and writing, typing on laptops and just sitting quietly.  END
BEGIN NOW Iris sits on a stool behind the counter looking up as a bell on the door rings.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts down her book entitled Sophie’s World, inserting a bookmark made from an old time slip.  END
BEGIN NOW Brushes the hair out of her face and takes off her reading glasses.  END
BEGIN NOW Unshielded bright hazel-green eyes with reading tired lids. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Wow, looks like it’s getting cold out there,” and rain starts pelting the windows.  END
BEGIN NOW “The hell happened to the weather today? Just when it was looking really nice.  END
BEGIN NOW What can I get for you? Something warm I’m guessing.” And she’s trying to do something about the look of disappointment on this girl’s face, this girl reeking of nicotine and trying to brush off her cold shakes.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Coffee, black, big cup.” She holds herself tight, rubbing her arms for friction heat.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl in front of her, behind the counter, has plain dirty blonde hair, knee length khaki shorts, knee high green striped socks and black Converse All-Stars.  END
BEGIN NOW The blue hooded sweater has the sleeves rolled up and the zipper half way down.  END
BEGIN NOW On the right breast is what looks like a gray smattering of ink drops.  END
BEGIN NOW She has simple gold studs in her ears, and three small rings going up the crest of the lobe.  END
BEGIN NOW The shirt under the sweater is grey.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael sizes her up as a small B cup.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Iris: (humming along to her Beatles mix which has just started Blackbird) END
BEGIN NOW 	Her hands move the cup under the industrial brewer and she pulls the spout, sending a cascade of coffee cup-ward, splashing on the bottom only to wave up the sides and still contained within it’s papery prison.  END
BEGIN NOW She slides that caution coffee is hot hand protection slip around the diameter and a plastic lid on top, perforated on both ends to allow the proper flow of liquid during the tipping and drinking phase of consumption.  END
BEGIN NOW 	She hands it to the young woman across from her with her Turkish tobacco breath and slowly warming up so her arms fall off her chest revealing the ending scene of her once cold hardened nipples.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s something they can both be embarrassed about, they can pretend they’re not there, and neither of them really noticed because heaven forbid we talk about things we can’t really prevent.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we can’t always be in control.  END
BEGIN NOW And thunder tumble rumbles off a cloud in the distance, it would have been a twenty-seven second count if either of them saw the lightening.  END
BEGIN NOW And Iris looks up from the register to hand the lady her change but she’s already seated, looking out around the café.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael doesn’t come here often at all, being usually locked up at the mission, finding volunteers from churches and youth groups, looking for funding, and all the while trying to feed a bunch of people that can’t afford it.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the paintings and portraits on the wall, the charcoals, the watercolors, relief’s, sketches, prints and she’s thinking, damn that’s a lot of decent looking art.  END
BEGIN NOW The portrait of an artist as a young man draws her attention.  END
BEGIN NOW The charcoal lines and shadows, the delicate shading and broody mood of the piece. END
BEGIN NOW 	Rachael Vox holds a cup of coffee and hands over one dollar and sixty-five cents, she hands it over reluctantly because she’s poor.  END
BEGIN NOW Because this cup of coffee will warm me up, because I’m cold, because I forgot my sweater at home like a dumbass.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I need something to calm my nerves after that hideous beast of a woman at the bank.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I needed to get out of the cold for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW And here I am at a table looking around at the coffee shop people, one with a laptop and headphones, one with a book, and a couple holding a hand on the surface of a table and looking into each other’s eyes, talking quietly.  END
BEGIN NOW And some dude is thumbing through the notebooks standing there with his hands leafing through the pages trying to find something lined or unlined, what kind of paper and my pen might bleed through this one, and hmmm paper’s too rough, maybe just a simple college ruled and this is for notes and writings and stuff right, not sketching seriously and maybe I should just get a new pen to go with it I mean why not, ok and yes something black and slick and smooth writing something that won’t scratch the paper and rip and tear and hurt my notebook we can’t have that no no no, not at all that would be very bad, no scars for the ink to bleed no wounds except in words and no, let’s see what kind of money we’re talking about here because I really like this pen and to settle for something less could prove disaster we can’t settle we must be satisfied and that’s what matters. END
BEGIN NOW 	So here I am in this coffee shop, no eyes on me, I blend in, soaking up the anomnity, revealing in it, and wallowing.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t have a book or a notebook or anything but my cup and here I am, just drinking it.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s still hot enough to scald my taste buds and scorch the throat on the way down, the plastic lid comes off in a bouquet of steam and scent.  END
BEGIN NOW I watch the rain flick and prick and smack the windows, and tap tap tap it hits the glass and I stare at it, avoiding eye contact with anyone that wants a conversation and honestly I don’t really desire attention like that right now, just quiet in the coffee shop and I don’t want to worry, but then the door opens.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s ring ding ding with the small metal bell, and the belle entering has a boy behind her holding the door open and she says “Thanks.” And she means it.  END
BEGIN NOW And he smiles because he likes doing nice things for pretty girls.  END
BEGIN NOW The jacket she wears and the sweater enveloping his torso are scatter splattered with drops and wet pock marks, they both wear blue jeans and sneakers.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a knit cap and a clean shaven face and she has her short, raven-black hair in pig tails.  END
BEGIN NOW Her opal eyes flash on sight of the citizens and fixtures of the place, eyes the stage and looks Rachael right in the eyes and her heart skips a beat like a split second stab.  END
BEGIN NOW The rings and studs in her ears, the ring in her eyebrow and what looks like a tattoo peeking out from under the left sleeve of her cream colored jacket.  END
BEGIN NOW They unzip and the boy rubs his hands together blowing into them to try and make temperature adjustments, and he looks at her and says, END
BEGIN NOW 	“Whatcha want?” Smiling every time he looks at her. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Mmm, tea, green, chai tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell yeah.” And he scratches at her back and walks to the counter while she takes a seat at the corner table.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl at the counter with the stripped socks jumps off her chair and greets him excitedly and he smiles and says hello and they both look at the girl and she grins at him and he loves it.  END
BEGIN NOW He places the order and I hear, “is Jolie around?” and the girl says something like “…out for a bit… try back… won’t be that long… maybe.” And he says, “cool.” And goes to sit down with the girl.  END
BEGIN NOW Out of the corner of my eye, I see them lean close and talk excitedly; they play the name dropping game over musicians, especially guitar players.  END
BEGIN NOW They laugh and mock each other’s tastes and find common ground and smile at each other a lot and honestly I’m jealous.  END
BEGIN NOW And here I am eavesdropping in a café.  END
BEGIN NOW The window takes interest again and it looks like the rain let up for a bit and hey look there’s sunlight and that means it’s my cue to get back to business.  END
BEGIN NOW So I take one last look around and the boy looks at me like he knows me from somewhere but can’t quite remember and quickly gets back to the task at hand.  END
BEGIN NOW 	And she leaves the building wrapping her arms back around but not before extracting a cigarette and a lighter.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks a Bic and flames the end of another nail in the coffin, breathing deeply.  END
BEGIN NOW Exhaling in shudders and shivers, she puts her head down and marches on down the street, on and past the cars parked and passing, the four wheeled parade of sedans and station wagons and sport utility vehicles, the meters and meter maids, parking lots and more banks and fuck that bitch, and she flicks the ash and marches on.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a trail of a tail of smoke wafting and curling around her head and she puffs away with a furrowed brow.  END
BEGIN NOW And finally there’s Bailamos, which is Spanish for we dance, and she sees the mural and the side door to the office and she walks to the front double doors with heavy wood and spiraled brass handles pulling it open on the hinges, entering and she shivers in the new warmth. END
BEGIN NOW 	She’s standing in front of a desk of dark stained wood behind which stands a young girl of Mexican descent, her dark straight black hair and light brown skin with dark eyes, and she’s wearing a white pleated skirt and a white cardigan.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael hears her say, “table for one?” in perfect west coast English and raises an eye brow at her white Adidas sneakers.  END
BEGIN NOW And Rachael says, END
BEGIN NOW 	“I need to speak with Maestra.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Un momento senorita.” Flawless Mexico City Spanish. END
BEGIN NOW 	Rachael sits down crossing her legs and barely has enough time to sink into the chair when the girl previously behind the desk intones, END
BEGIN NOW 	“Maestra will see you now, Julio will take you.” She bows her head, sending her off through the kitchen, behind the walk-in freezer and refrigerator, past the pantry and the larder, to a simple green door and Julio knocks twice in slow succession. END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock. END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Entre,” she says in Mexican accented French.  END
BEGIN NOW Julio takes his leave, bowing out and walking backwards.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael pushes open one more door; The Skeez is in cut off shorts of denim, wearing no shoes and a sunset red-orange knit sweater from the marketplace in Rosarito.  END
BEGIN NOW Reclined on a couch and smoking a joint, her dreads pulled back and tucked under a wool cap in Grateful Dead colors.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks up at Rachael and END
BEGIN NOW 	“There you are,” and she says it dripping with affection, like a mother to a child that’s late for dinner but still so glad she’s safe.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“And here I am.” She sits down on the couch and sighs heavy.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs again, and “Look, so my loan was rejected today, for the exhaust hood.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Really? Even with all the collateral you have to offer?” The Skeez smirks lovingly.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s really getting a kick out of this. END
BEGIN NOW 	“That’s not funny,” she looks a bit hurt, like today hasn’t been going so well and please not right now because I hate to be a bother and I hate owing anyone anything and I still just want to strangle that bitch at the bank but here I am on your couch, again; don’t look at me like that please, not right now, and seriously this isn’t going to end well not with those eyes and I can’t I just can’t and you know that. END
BEGIN NOW 	“You know I’m only doing this so I can write it off as a tax deduction.” Winking still prodding because it’s ok, I’m right here and you don’t need to worry because I’ll take care of you and just seeing you makes me happy, and you know that no matter what I’ll be right here when you need me, and I mean shit man, it’s only money. END
BEGIN NOW 	The Skeez walks over to the safe and twirls the knobs, happy little clicks as pulls the latch sending a network of gears and mechanics into play.  END
BEGIN NOW And cold steel opens to all kinds of private treasures.  END
BEGIN NOW She stuffs an envelope full of money, tucks the flap in, unsealed and closes the heavy door to the safe, with all the clicks and kerchunks and everything settles.  END
BEGIN NOW She reaches over to the wine rack in the alcove and finds the right vintage, that label with nothing but the year and the word Muscat.  END
BEGIN NOW She hands the envelope to Rachael and tells her not to look so guilty, it’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael tells her she’ll pay her back someday, but they both know she’s lying. END
BEGIN NOW 	“You look pale and hungry, I’ll have the kitchen make you a little something warm, also we should drink this wine before it’s past peak.” Fetching some balloon glasses and a corkscrew.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks but really you shouldn’t, I mean there’s only so much hospitality a girl can take and these feelings of guilt even though I really could use something to eat and something to drink and this money is more than enough, but The Skeez is in the kitchen talking to Juanito who runs the food. END
BEGIN NOW 	Her knit cap held high she walks back in and finds a jacket to lend the poor girl for the walk home, but in her mind she wants to delay that moment as long as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW A little food, a little wine and do take shelter from the cold, the rain, the dreary mission house with it’s cold rooms and that awful office with the chain smoker teeth yellow walls, with the coffee and god knows what else stained, ragged carpet.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t we just stay here for a while, forever maybe and your face is so pretty but worried and sad and what can I do, what can I do. END
BEGIN NOW 	“Don’t worry dear, don’t worry, I’ll take care of you for now, for a while, as long as you need me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m right here and will be.” END
BEGIN NOW 	She says, “Thank you,” she says “thank you so much.” And her head falls into her hands on her knees, crying, sobbing and choking on the tears.  END
BEGIN NOW 	“Oh dear, dear,” looking for a box of tissues or a handkerchief or something to blow her nose on and oh dear oh dear.  END
BEGIN NOW There they are, she hands one over, END
BEGIN NOW 	“Thank you,” She looks up from her tear streaked face, bites her lip and again with “Thank you.” END
BEGIN NOW 	The Skeez sighs and looks on her with compassion, with tenderness, with warmth and with love.  END
BEGIN NOW If she could make everything better somehow, in a moment despite the cost.  END
BEGIN NOW They both look up when they hear END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock. END
BEGIN NOW 	Knock. END
BEGIN NOW 	The Skeez gets up, saunters to the door and takes the plate in with some silver and a napkin of deep wine red cotton.  END
BEGIN NOW She lays it all on the table, right in front of her, plate’s hot, watch your fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW It steams steady carrying scents and memories, cumin and cinnamon, slow braised pork, corn butter and beans, and rice.  END
BEGIN NOW Overtones of lime and cilantro.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael looks at it, the smells drifting into her nostrils, setting off signals of salivation.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a good long time since she’s had a meal that didn’t come straight from the can.  END
BEGIN NOW Into and out of the goddamn microwave.  END
BEGIN NOW The glasses are placed on the table with care, a corkscrew inserted into the cork, it squeaks when she twists it.  END
BEGIN NOW That sound of a cork popping, that uncorking sound of release, it’s just been in place for all these years waiting for this moment.  END
BEGIN NOW The wine is poured into glasses side by side to equal volumes, the color; the fruit and smell are much too complex for their smoker palettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Had they been pure of tongue and trained in this delicate art of distinguishing tastes then hints of tobacco, strawberry, maple, with light floral notes and a finish that sends it all home.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a damn good bottle of wine, there’s no such thing as wasting it, especially when it’s about company and sharing with someone you love.  END
BEGIN NOW 	Rachael picks up a fork and starts into the food in front of her while The Skeez changes the record, leafing through the vinyl library on the shelving in the alcove.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds exactly what she’s looking for and she gently sets the needle into the groove.  END
BEGIN NOW That thunderous guitar like bah bah bah bah bada duh then Janis starts in with her unmistakable raspy then clear and straight from the gut voice.  END
BEGIN NOW The tune is Cry Baby and Rachael looks up at her with a mouthful of food like honestly, you’ve got to be kidding me; it’s not that she doesn’t love this song, it’s just timing.  END
BEGIN NOW The timing is just so inappropriate.  END
BEGIN NOW The Skeez is laughing and laughing herself silly, sorry I just couldn’t resist, it seemed so fitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Her laughing makes Rachael crack a smile, her smile making The Skeez smile too.  END
BEGIN NOW And she sits back down on the black leather couch, lifting the glass of wine to her lips and sipping it down feeling the alcohol warmth as it travels down the throat into the belly, sitting and resting until it’s digested and pissed out. END
BEGIN NOW 	The food is nearly all gone by now, just sauce and stray rice, the odd bean or two.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael’s stomach is full and satisfied, she leans back holding the wine glass by the stem and taking the occasional sip, feeling a bit flushed in the cheeks.  END
BEGIN NOW The face of The Skeez is blushed against the natural brown of her cheeks.  END
BEGIN NOW The record has long since been spinning on grooveless label, thump and scratch.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael looks at her twenty dollar department store wrist watch, noting the time and wondering if the rain has cleared up by now it must be getting late and she has a bus to catch.  END
BEGIN NOW She says “Thanks,” one more time and “Thank you, so much, for everything.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Don’t mention it,” waving her hand away like it’s really nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW But it’s something; it’s such a wonderful something. END
BEGIN NOW 	“It’s about that time, I hate to say it, but yeah, I’ve got a bus to catch.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“Don’t worry about the bus, I’ll have Julio take you, and I won’t hear a no thanks about it, I insist, it’s ok, stop worrying so goddamn much, you’ll start going gray.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t have that happen to your pretty little head now can we.” END
BEGIN NOW 	“I’ll be alright.” And she’s hoping it’s true, but she doesn’t really know for certain and how could she, really. END
BEGIN NOW 	The Skeez brushes her hair away from her face and kisses her forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW Rachael blushes a little deeper than wine alone can allow and stands up.  END
BEGIN NOW Not such a bad night after all.  END
BEGIN NOW The Skeez watches her walk out of her office, watches her all the way through the door until she can’t see her anymore, until the door closes and clicks into place.  END
BEGIN NOW She downs the rest of the wine, pulling it right off the bottle and curls her legs to her chin on the couch, closing her eyes and hugging her knees thinking all the while stupid stupid stupid… END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing terribly interesting about being a nurse.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing glamorous.  END
BEGIN NOW I read somewhere or other that women typically go through a nursing phase and playing doctor and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly it’s just an outlet for what the psychologists call maternal instinct.  END
BEGIN NOW The drive in the mind of a woman to care for, heal, nurture and deal with people that can’t do much for themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW I have noticed in my last few years, having had the time and curiosity to study the femmes around me in a way that borderlines between pure science and drunken theorizing, that many of the beautiful women I’ve encountered are going to nursing school.  END
BEGIN NOW This shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, and quite frankly, there’s nothing shocking about this in the least.  END
BEGIN NOW The part that doesn’t make sense is this.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where everything falls apart.  END
BEGIN NOW In all my time in the offices of doctors, in hospitals, dentists offices, veterinarian clinics, in a million waiting rooms with uncomfortable chairs and the same selection of last year’s parenting magazines, I have not once in my life come across the beautiful nurse.  END
BEGIN NOW She seems an elusive creature, hiding, lurking, possibility hibernating in the many rooms that average, uninjured people are not allowed into at hospitals.  END
BEGIN NOW  I wouldn’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW They never let me go through those doors.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s always a chance of ending up somewhere gruesome and horrific if you wander around the hospital anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW And that would be achieving the opposite of my goal.  END
BEGIN NOW Worth noting is the fact that last year all the nursing students were art majors.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they realized or were led to believe that there was no money to be made in the art world.  END
BEGIN NOW That making a successful career in the art world involved more than starving in your romantic rat hole of an apartment, drinking cheap wine from a gallon jug and yelling at a blank canvass about the rationality of color and the complexities of crossbreeding combinations from the three primaries.  END
BEGIN NOW As seems to be the case for all but the true believers, everyone drops out and ends up at nursing school or waiting tables.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting tables seems to be much like being a nurse.  END
BEGIN NOW Granted that I have no experience being one or the other.  END
BEGIN NOW I have on numerous occasions been on the receiving end and the treatment is quite similar.  END
BEGIN NOW I should add that those lucky waitresses that make the jump up to bartender enjoy a much closer link to the role of the nurse in the lives of not quite there yet invalids.  END
BEGIN NOW  A promotion measured in clear financial increase and a separate set of romantic notions.  END
BEGIN NOW The trouble with all of these professions and the attitudes behind them should be fairly clear.  END
BEGIN NOW In each case the nurse is not there to diagnose, to prescribe medication, to elaborate on various methods for treatment.  END
BEGIN NOW The nurse is there to bring food to the patient, to administer the drug, and to clean the shit out from under the beds.  END
BEGIN NOW  The nurse is not there to help aside from cleaning, feeding, and being an extra set of hands to do what the doctors tell them.  END
BEGIN NOW Being a nurse means becoming intimate with every possible type of body fluid.  END
BEGIN NOW Being a nurse means being jaded about the trivialities of everyday problems.  END
BEGIN NOW Being a nurse means dealing with humanity on a level that is typically only shared between a mother and an infant.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just as the good bartender with put her customers to sleep, just as a good waitress will see that her table orders dessert and always has something to sip on.  END
BEGIN NOW Being a nurse means changing the sheets and spooning creamed nonsense into the sagging maw of some halfwit half brained charity case with vacant smoke stained eyes and scabs unscratched because the muscles just don’t move like that anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW  With smiles that remain fixed on a television in the corner because the box emits light and sounds and flashes with color and excitement.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sometimes they scream, sometimes they cry.  END
BEGIN NOW Most times they drool and other times they piss with ruthless enthusiasm.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes the patients smile because there’s a nurse cleaning up their excrement. END
BEGIN NOW “Just like mom used to wipe my ass.” END
BEGIN NOW He laughs to himself and looks back at the television.  END
BEGIN NOW There are reruns on most of the networks these days.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not a matter of real concern.  END
BEGIN NOW  His roommate hasn’t said a word in two weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW Just about as long as they’ve been together.  END
BEGIN NOW Mac was lucky, he has the window bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Mac also has movement of his neck and back and most of his face is still intact and he can talk a country mile from sun up to sun down and so help you god if you try and stop his god given right to free speech and so help you god if you try to poison his food like the last nurse and so help you god if you so much as dream of switching the channel on the television because that was my show Goddamnit. END
BEGIN NOW Mac leans up against an elevated bed.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks down the lower half of his torso and thinks as little as possible about prostate cancer.  END
BEGIN NOW  He looks at the lump under the blankets and frowns at it like a paper boy at a flat tire. END
BEGIN NOW “Useless piece of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW At least I’m old.  END
BEGIN NOW At least this didn’t happen say, twenty years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Charlie! What was you doin’ say, twenty years ago?” END
BEGIN NOW The other man in the room lies flat in his bed.  END
BEGIN NOW His face has been hung over for the last few years.  END
BEGIN NOW Eyelids just past half way to closed, slack jawed yellow skin neck fat jowls flabby with gravity towards the center of the earth.  END
BEGIN NOW Making a path for lazy mouth moisture to accumulate and drip into an accepting pillow.  END
BEGIN NOW Charlie isn’t technically in a coma.  END
BEGIN NOW That doctor with the Polish name, ends with an i or something along those lines.  END
BEGIN NOW He said it wasn’t technically a coma, but all the symptoms were there.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever that means.  END
BEGIN NOW Not technically.  END
BEGIN NOW Some doctor.  END
BEGIN NOW All he does all day is wander into rooms with a clipboard, ask the nurse some question and then disappear.  END
BEGIN NOW  How many years of schooling and thousands of dollars for a top notch education, to land a job as clipboard courier.  END
BEGIN NOW  All he has to offer Charlie is a place to sleep if you could call it that.  END
BEGIN NOW All he has to offer are morphine shots and a few meals a day.  END
BEGIN NOW Hydration and synthetic sustenance. END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty years ago, hell.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me back the eighties.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me back the functional decadence of two decades ago.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Hoo boy.  END
BEGIN NOW The women with all that hair! All that hair! Came out of their heads like hedges and down to legs in miniskirts and high heels.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time me and Mark Suthers were in this place ‘round North Beach.  END
BEGIN NOW Been up all night and day doing glorious lines of coke in the back of Mark’s Fiat.  END
BEGIN NOW Ended up in this dive with a few good taps and godawful juke box.  END
BEGIN NOW Always sounded like some kind of faggot dance music bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW But this doll walks in.  END
BEGIN NOW And believe me, she would have broken your neck from whiplash.  END
BEGIN NOW She walked into that place like Cleopatra descending on Rome.  END
BEGIN NOW All cackling bracelets and long legs that you could climb to heaven on.  END
BEGIN NOW Had a face like a frozen pond on a moonless night.  END
BEGIN NOW Breathtaking.  END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely.  END
BEGIN NOW Mark gets it into his head to make a pass and he’s all fumblefuck for words.  END
BEGIN NOW She gives him a long looking over and laughs at him like good mother when her child displays a drawing that could be a bear or a dog or a dinosaur.  END
BEGIN NOW He slumps back over to the bar and me and the barkeep and takes his beer, near full beer in one of those nice glasses, and throws the fucker clear to the other side of the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Had to drag his ass out of there find us a quite place to get a cup of coffee right quick.  END
BEGIN NOW He was shit for driving at that point and I was catching up to him.  END
BEGIN NOW  I got him to the diner and get some coffee under his nose for a change and he looks right up at me and says, END
BEGIN NOW ‘Now Mac, why you gotta ruin a good night like that?’ END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I damn near shit myself.  END
BEGIN NOW I explained the situation to him a thousand times and he insisted she was about to come home with him.  END
BEGIN NOW I asked if he got her name or number or anything and he just looks at me and says, END
BEGIN NOW ‘Why you gotta ruin a good night like that?’ END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty years ago, hell.” Mac looks out the window, watching the wheel chaired patients getting pushed around by apathetic nurses and slightly less enthusiastic relatives.  END
BEGIN NOW A young girl in a white coat enters the room and says something like, END
BEGIN NOW “Good afternoon Mister Daltry.  END
BEGIN NOW How is everything today?” END
BEGIN NOW “How the fuck do you think everything is? I’m still here ain’t I?” END
BEGIN NOW “Indeed you are Mister Daltry.  END
BEGIN NOW Indeed you are.” The girl in the coat checks the clipboards at the foot of each bed.  END
BEGIN NOW She writes a few new words in.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks over the two men and notes their present condition.  END
BEGIN NOW “Is there anything I can do for you while I’m here?” She asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Would you be so kind as to fetch me some cold beer and a pack of cigarettes? Maybe a nice roast beef sandwich and also, if it’s not too much trouble, suck my cock? I don’t want to be a burden or anything.” END
BEGIN NOW “I see your sense of humor is still intact Mister Daltry.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s excellent news.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll ask the doctor if there’s anything he’d be willing to provide for you.  END
BEGIN NOW In the meantime, I suggest getting plenty of rest.” END
BEGIN NOW “Right.  END
BEGIN NOW Rest up.  END
BEGIN NOW Big day tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW All that bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW What has rest ever given me, really? What do I need to recharge for? Get all energetic and healthy so I can die on my feet?” END
BEGIN NOW “Now, now Mister Daltry, let’s not get too excited.  END
BEGIN NOW How has Mister Finn been? Any changes?” END
BEGIN NOW “Charlie? Nope.  END
BEGIN NOW Charlie just lies there, drooling at me.  END
BEGIN NOW Same as yesterday.  END
BEGIN NOW Same as tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Same as next week and next month and next year if he makes it that long.  END
BEGIN NOW Charlie ain’t moved nor said nothing as long as I been here.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes a great listener though.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s nice Mister Daltry.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll send someone up with a meal in a little while.” The nurse leaves the room and leaves behind two beds with two old men and a longwinded one sided conversation. END
BEGIN NOW “Hoo-fucking-ray for meal time.” Mac looks out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW The people in the wheel chairs don’t seem to be reacting much to being outside.  END
BEGIN NOW As if the whole idea of being wheeled around the garden for a while is for the benefit of the nurses.  END
BEGIN NOW Give them time to smell the roses.  END
BEGIN NOW Let them get out of the stagnant stale breadbox hospital rooms, the long hallways with acoustics built for sharp sounding shoes marching towards inevitable disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW “God, if I ever end up in one of those damn chairs I hope someone has the common courtesy to push me down a flight of stairs.” END
BEGIN NOW Mac returns his attention to the television and refuses to change the channel.  END
BEGIN NOW The remote has been lost all week and he will never admit this to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW The nurse closes the door and takes a heavy intake of breath.  END
BEGIN NOW She holds the air in for a second or two and lets her lungs empty slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets her shoulders sag and slumps her back and releases a stale hospital sigh, drained of the vital molecules, back to the air ducts for another round against the filters and conditioners. END
BEGIN NOW She pads along the corridor in simple black flats, made for spending eight hours on your feet, made cheap and disposable in case they are doused with some leaking bag, be it a body or bacteria.  END
BEGIN NOW The nurse walks along with the clipboard held close to her chest and looking not quite down, but not straight ahead.  END
BEGIN NOW The air smells like sanitizer and stray coughs that wandered out of the mouths of children, slowing dying of emphysema due to a few years living above a busy street END
BEGIN NOW Behind the reception desk is the gateway to the break room.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a coffee pot and a water cooler.  END
BEGIN NOW A small refrigerator for staff to keep food in.  END
BEGIN NOW A table that discourages lingering and chairs to match.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite the chairs, or in spite of, the receptionist has been on extended lunch break.  END
BEGIN NOW The phone jockey twirls cold spaghetti in a plastic container meant for leftovers and the transportation of lunch.  END
BEGIN NOW The noodles spin on a fork absentmindedly.  END
BEGIN NOW “Big day for breeders.” The receptionist says. END
BEGIN NOW “Excuse me?” The nurse replies. END
BEGIN NOW “The maternity ward? It’s poppin’ in there.  END
BEGIN NOW Must have been twenty kids in the last twelve hours.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d bet there was a power outage nine months ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn blackout babies.” The receptionist receives a mouth full of noodles and lets her teeth do all the work. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, well.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a hospital.” The nurse pours herself a cup of coffee into a white ceramic mug.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a sip and the bitterness of burnt beans—overly roasted coffee—overwhelms.  END
BEGIN NOW She shivers taking in a petite sip of still too hot to drink, still too burnt to enjoy coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW She holds the mug in her hands, letting the coldness of her fingers thaw, wrapped around the mug in temperature contrast. END
BEGIN NOW “Damn right this is a hospital.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t really forget this is a hospital.  END
BEGIN NOW The smell, the sounds, the phones, the phones, the phones.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone rushing around from room to room, delaying death and making everyone sign forms about it.  END
BEGIN NOW God.  END
BEGIN NOW Hospital, indeed.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have got a job at a massage parlor.” The receptionist takes another bite, lazily flicking noodles around her mouth, masticating starchy strips of boiled flour and egg. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re still young.  END
BEGIN NOW You could get a job anywhere answering phones.  END
BEGIN NOW Not like you spent the last three years going to school for it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW But I’m so settled here.  END
BEGIN NOW It took me days to learn everyone’s names.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to go through with that all over again just yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides… Benefits and whatnot.” END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm…hmm.” The nurse tries again at the coffee, hoping to get something more for her efforts, hoping that waiting will pay off.  END
BEGIN NOW The temperate has dropped to acceptable levels, but the bitterness lingers. END
BEGIN NOW “Say, tell me.  END
BEGIN NOW What made you want to get into nursing anyway? You’re pretty enough to get a job somewhere else.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, with a body like yours you could have been a dancer or something.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dancing? Seriously? Oh, no.  END
BEGIN NOW No, no.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t dance for shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Let alone money.  END
BEGIN NOW No.  END
BEGIN NOW But, well, the nursing thing just kind of happened.  END
BEGIN NOW I was at college for whatever, undergrad stuff, fluff classes.  END
BEGIN NOW Just killing time and lost in the drift of now what.  END
BEGIN NOW The nursing program caught my eye.  END
BEGIN NOW Year and a half more of classes, and viola, I have a career.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost guaranteed.  END
BEGIN NOW Right out of school.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone needs nurses, I guess.” END
BEGIN NOW “So it was kinda a fool proof path to getting your loans paid off?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Loans and bills and rent and you know, benefits…” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, benefits.” The receptionist stabs at the noodles, propping her head up with and arm resting on the table. END
BEGIN NOW “I always seem to get the old men.” END
BEGIN NOW “No shortage of those right now.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tell me about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Always the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Vulgar comments and stares.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t stand it.  END
BEGIN NOW They give me the chills.” END
BEGIN NOW “What would you prefer? Dealing with babies or burn victims?” END
BEGIN NOW “God.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I’d take the ER over watching a bunch of dirty old men dying slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW At least there’s something always going on in the ER.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t have time to think so much.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thinking’s a bitch.  END
BEGIN NOW Never gets you anywhere.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tell me about it.” The nurse finishes her burnt coffee and leaves the mug in the sink, the last few drops evaporating into a brown ring at the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, back to the rounds.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t work too hard.” And she’s gone. END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm.” The receptionist pokes at stray, broken noodles.  END
BEGIN NOW Too short to twirl, too long to throw away.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just yet. END
BEGIN NOW The narrator invites you to a small community park.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind with picnic benches and a swing set.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of park with a basketball hoop and concrete in all the right places.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of place where you expect to find children playing tag, or running around being children.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a river nearby.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of river that is dammed in the summer in order to allow the kids a deep enough place to swim.  END
BEGIN NOW On the basketball court are a young boy and a young girl.  END
BEGIN NOW They have been playing a game.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy is providing running commentary.  END
BEGIN NOW “Dermit takes control of the ball; he makes a line drive for the hoop, takes the open shot!” The boy throws the ball and watches as it bounces off the backboard and on to the concrete. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh! So Close! The score remains four to two, Dermit leading by two in the third quarter.” The boy stands on one end of the court, waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW “Possession of the ball goes to Russie.  END
BEGIN NOW Russie eyes the defense and seems to be planning an attack.” The girl dribbles the ball in place and eyes the boy crossly. END
BEGIN NOW “Do you really have to announce everything I’m doing?” She shifts her nose and mouth in opposite directions and furrows her brow. END
BEGIN NOW “C’mon Russie, the clock’s ticking we have to be home before it gets dark.” He spits with acquired machismo on the concrete court. END
BEGIN NOW The girl continues bouncing the ball back and forth between her hands.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls forward and dashes straight at the boy.  END
BEGIN NOW She lunges at him with enough speed to stall the commentary.  END
BEGIN NOW A moment before contact she spins around him in a dance move suggesting her own elusiveness.  END
BEGIN NOW She hurls the ball up and out and into the net. END
BEGIN NOW “Three points for Russie! The score is now five to four, Russie leading and only ten minutes left!” The girl gives her account of the game as the boy stands rooted in disbelief, jaw slack then tight in an air of stubborn renewal. END
BEGIN NOW “Dermit has the ball.” He says to himself, standing under the net.  END
BEGIN NOW He bounces the ball three times in a personal ritual of determination.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks up to see the girl standing with arms and legs at the ready, awaiting the moment to block his shot.  END
BEGIN NOW He starts off at a slow pace, marching in a weave trying to weaken her powers of anticipation.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her eyes follow his movements and her body bounces along with the ball from side to side.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes a charge, fakes to the left, hands to the right and snatches the ball mid bounce from the boy’s control.  END
BEGIN NOW She breaks away and takes a clean shot off the rebound and into the net. END
BEGIN NOW “Another for Russie! She now leads by three.  END
BEGIN NOW Seven minutes left on the clock and the ball goes back to Dermit.” She smiles her way back to the other end of the court, taking it at a brisk jog.  END
BEGIN NOW A breeze picks up and the evening is perched on a branch above, waiting to swoop down and swallow the sun when the day comes up to the surface to have dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW  She shivers slightly and brushes her hair out of her face. END
BEGIN NOW “We don’t have all day Dermit! Clock’s ticking!” She laughs at him and his frustration. END
BEGIN NOW “Dermit has the ball.” He reassures himself.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes three bounces in rhythmic fashion.  END
BEGIN NOW The springs of his legs burst forward, propelling him half the length of the court.  END
BEGIN NOW He stops at the center and lunges, ejecting the ball towards the hoop with the full force of his body.  END
BEGIN NOW The only sound is cloth on rubber; the delicate penetration of three points passing right through the net.  END
BEGIN NOW He lets out a small cry of victory.  END
BEGIN NOW “What a play! Dermit ties the game with only five minutes left! The level of excitement is almost overwhelming.  END
BEGIN NOW The crowd is going crazy!” The boy runs a victory lap around the court making all the sounds so his audience doesn’t have to. END
BEGIN NOW The girl takes the ball and walks back underneath the hoop.  END
BEGIN NOW She bounces the ball in place with one hand and looks at the opposite side of the court.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy is grinning now, victory seemingly within his grasp.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun hits the horizon and seems to speed up time.  END
BEGIN NOW The permeating dimness of dusk; the sudden chill brought on by the blocked rays of heat.  END
BEGIN NOW And then the sun sinks out of sight. END
BEGIN NOW “Aww man! We can’t end with a tie game.  END
BEGIN NOW Hurry up and play, we still have enough time for one more.” END
BEGIN NOW The girl doesn’t answer.  END
BEGIN NOW She stares at the other end of the court.  END
BEGIN NOW She stares ahead and right through the boy.  END
BEGIN NOW “If I make this shot,” she thinks, “then I win.  END
BEGIN NOW If I miss, then he’ll get the rebound and he’ll win.” She stands in place, bouncing the ball in the same spot, devoid of expression.  END
BEGIN NOW “If I make this shot, then I win…” She bounces the ball again. END
BEGIN NOW “C’mon Russie! If you don’t hurry then my mom will get mad at me again!” END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t hear anything except the breeze as it gains courage and strength, enough to rustle the leaves and wave a few flags.  END
BEGIN NOW  “What happens if I win?” She continues thinking, barely feeling as the ball glides from her hand to the ground and back again.  END
BEGIN NOW “What do I win, exactly? Is there a prize of some kind? Would victory really mean anything?” END
BEGIN NOW “The ball’s in your court, Russie! What are you going to do with it? It’s either win or lose right now! The ball’s in your court, time’s running out! You better make a move!” The boy tries to goad her on.  END
BEGIN NOW He stands at the other end of the court with his hands on his knees and his eyes on the ball. END
BEGIN NOW “The ball’s in my court… What happens if I don’t make a move? Will the game be suspended on account of inactivity? Will victory go nowhere? The ball’s in my court.  END
BEGIN NOW Win or lose.  END
BEGIN NOW Make a move.” She continues bouncing the ball and watching the leaves being unbuttoned from the trees as the breeze blows them apart.  END
BEGIN NOW She bites her lower lip and looks at the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW “Come on! I have to go home soon! I can’t wait all night for you to do something! Mom is going to kill me if I’m late for dinner again.” He kicks at a leaf lying dead on the concrete. END
BEGIN NOW “What happens if I lose? Will I be doomed to live in shame? Will I be forever cursed? Will I be a loser? Am I establishing patterns that will only repeat themselves as I grow older and the consequences become more critical? Will he lord his victory over me and think of me as some kind of conquered goal? Would beating me in a game of basketball give him the right to think less of me? To condescend to me? Would I have proven myself inadequate to the world at large? What does it really mean to lose? What have I lost, really?” The ball stops bouncing.  END
BEGIN NOW She holds it in both hands and presses it to her chest.  END
BEGIN NOW “The ball’s in my court.  END
BEGIN NOW My turn to make a move.  END
BEGIN NOW Win or lose.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t we just stay tied? Can’t we just be equals and go home happy? Does it always have to end up like this? What’s the point if one of us always ends up losing? Isn’t there enough loss already? Do we really need to act it out in a game? But, the ball’s in my court…” She trails off in her thoughts and looks up at the sky growing dark and breeze becoming a wind, knocking the soft hairs of her arms into attention atop goose pimple hills where they wave like little flags. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey! Russie! Ruuussie! Hey! You still there? We have to get back, it’s getting too dark.  END
BEGIN NOW My mom’s probably already mad at me.” He gives her a stern look and notices that her eyes have welled up.  END
BEGIN NOW He notices her cheeks are wet and she’s shivering in the wind and her eyes are far away from the park.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey… Russie, c’mon.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s go home.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a good game.” END
BEGIN NOW The boy puts a hand on her shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW The touch snaps her back to the present.  END
BEGIN NOW She drops the ball and watches as it bounces lower each time and rolls away from her.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes follow the ball until it stops moving.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy leaves his hand on her shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, let’s go home, alright?” END
BEGIN NOW She nods.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy walks over to a bench and picks up their coats, putting his on as he walks back to the girl with hers in his hand.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts on her coat and buttons it all the way up the neck.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s still shivering.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy picks up the ball and looks for a second at the net.  END
BEGIN NOW He tucks the ball under his arm and the two of them walk home. END
BEGIN NOW The wind softens to a breeze again and the last bit of sunlight turns into street lamps and neon signs.  END
BEGIN NOW Into headlights and stop lights and the into the kind of light bulbs people use for illuminating the dining room in order that the mothers of young children can wait for them to get home while the food slowly becomes cool in a softly lit place. END
BEGIN NOW There’s something to be said about dining alone.  END
BEGIN NOW The art and science of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially in a big city with the world at your feet and options everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Selection is the first crucial step.  END
BEGIN NOW If you happen to own a car like the bourgeoisie asshole that you are, abandon the heap as soon as possible, maybe with a free to a good home sign on the windshield and the keys sitting on the front seat.  END
BEGIN NOW Now that you’re a little alleviated, pick a street and start walking.  END
BEGIN NOW Walk until you come to an intersection with as many options as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Pick a direction that looks laden with restaurants.  END
BEGIN NOW When the mattress stores and furniture outlets pan out and the mechanics have faded into the background of the urban mishmash the glow of neon signs will bloom over the gateways to fine cuisine.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have any preference about ethnicity or cultural settings for your dining experience, now is the time to keep that in mind.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be distracted by convenience, proximity and attractive front window displays.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be deceived.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep the original intent in mind.  END
BEGIN NOW This is important for dining alone properly. END
BEGIN NOW My problem was of a calendar nature.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a Sunday after Christmas.  END
BEGIN NOW I had been walking for the better part of an hour with hunger welling up to my neck and the coffee and cigarettes throughout the day beginning to take their toll on me.  END
BEGIN NOW I had had it in my head since waking that I wanted to eat some Chinese for the first time in months.  END
BEGIN NOW Chinese food sounded so exotic and in contrast to my usual diet of work scraps and dollar store noodles with canned tomato sauce or three days boiling chicken soup.  END
BEGIN NOW The appeal was over whelming.  END
BEGIN NOW I was forced into action. END
BEGIN NOW Around the job there was talk of a fantastic Chinese place up in Albany called China Village.  END
BEGIN NOW But Albany is at least a Bart ride away.  END
BEGIN NOW I had around sixty cent left on my last rail card and figured that now was not the time for a little northbound trek only for the sake of a meal.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a bit much for the budget.  END
BEGIN NOW Oddly, the only person in the kitchen with no comment on China Village was the young, recently married, Chinese girl that worked next to me.  END
BEGIN NOW She was the pastry chef and seemed to have something to say about everything else.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked at me yesterday and said, END
BEGIN NOW “Nick, you’re like the Eeyore of the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor sad and lonely Nick.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re so fucking depressing.” END
BEGIN NOW Was I really that depressing? I mean, I never had much to say and lived for the most part in my head at work.  END
BEGIN NOW But I never thought of myself as being depressing or a depressed kind of person.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinking always about other things, day dreaming, stuck with a song or focused on cutting some vegetable or other.  END
BEGIN NOW But depressed? Really? The comment came out of her mouth like child that’s been let out of the orthodontists, brace-less and facing the world with a set of shiny incisors for the first time since the forced exit from the chute between her mother’s legs.  END
BEGIN NOW I mulled that incident over again in my head for the twentieth time that evening.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, introspective is certainly applicable.  END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Her words left me self-centered and conflicted.  END
BEGIN NOW A little hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW And that may have made me depressed.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d prefer tragic.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I told her I was never alone as long as there was whiskey involved.  END
BEGIN NOW I dig my own holes, I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW And instead of climbing out, I’ll break the shovel and keep on until there’s dirt caked underneath my nails and soil stains on my hands and clothing. END
BEGIN NOW Before leaving to find a place of refreshment, I did a little research to find a restaurant that would be suitable and close enough to walk to.  END
BEGIN NOW The computer read off a list that centered on University and Shattuck—generally a failsafe destination for the famished—and I got moving.  END
BEGIN NOW From Telegraph there are numerous options for a footpath to the food court on the strip mall section of upper Shattuck.  END
BEGIN NOW The path is generally a kind of North West route that can either be colorful with all the signs of commerce or promises of higher education or mostly quiet suburban blocks with quaint sidewalks and street lights in front of clusters of housing units commonly known as neighborhoods.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a decent night for the more urban of routes, main streets with not exactly heavy traffic, but not what you might call dead.  END
BEGIN NOW The asphalt arteries carried enough sedans and sport utility cells to keep the beast breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW  It was a three cigarette meander down the road.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about how long it took. END
BEGIN NOW I was looking for a place called King Dong.  END
BEGIN NOW I confess that the name did catch my attention.  END
BEGIN NOW If there’s any reason I love the Chinese dialects I’d have to say that the lost in translation misinterpretation of the symbols tends to come up with more than a few words that could be construed as innuendo to my overly sexually stimulated mind.  END
BEGIN NOW The name King Dong conjured up sun kings, sun gods, fertility worship, a million people prostrate in front of a phallus of royal proportions.  END
BEGIN NOW If someone told me to eat a dick, I’d go straight to King Dong for a few bites of egg rolls.  END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunately, I didn’t remember more than the street name.  END
BEGIN NOW Details like actually address failed me.  END
BEGIN NOW Shattuck stretches on for miles in a few directions.  END
BEGIN NOW I could end up in Oakland one way or Albany in the other.  END
BEGIN NOW I decided to leave fate to go fuck it’s self and went in the opposite direction of home.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d settle on the first decent looking Chinese place I laid eyes on.  END
BEGIN NOW It took a few blocks and a few side streets.  END
BEGIN NOW One place was too crowded, another too large and empty.  END
BEGIN NOW But there was a street with two Chinese places on opposite sides of the street.  END
BEGIN NOW I figured competition would be high between them and quality would increase.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt safe here.  END
BEGIN NOW I walk up a place called May Flower, wondering what the hell a ship of fools had to do with Chinese food.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW  The place was small and silent.  END
BEGIN NOW I was the only one in the building aside from a cook and a man I could only assume was the owner.  END
BEGIN NOW This seemed like one of those family affairs. END
BEGIN NOW He looks up as the door makes a racket behind me, cutting off the December chill that tried to follow me in.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s in no hurry to seat me.  END
BEGIN NOW And I stand in expectation in the middle of the restaurant dining room.  END
BEGIN NOW Your move old man.  END
BEGIN NOW Should I seat myself, or would you like the honor of directing my ass to a chair of your preference? I would just like to sit down, take off my coat and hat and get my hands around a hot cup of tea END
BEGIN NOW A note about Chinese restaurants.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve always had an aversion to the places that set table without chopsticks.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s an inherent barbarous quality to western silverware, the need to cut and stab at the food before eating.  END
BEGIN NOW  I’m pretty sure that Confucius had something to say about that.  END
BEGIN NOW It might have something to do with the reason behind using chopsticks either as a genesis or an afterthought.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t remember these things.  END
BEGIN NOW Too many details.  END
BEGIN NOW But, the point is, the places that don’t set table with chopsticks are either pandering to the fumble fingers of the western hand or they seem to doubt their own authenticity, or perhaps it’s a gesture of condescending nature.  END
BEGIN NOW  As if anyone that walks in would be able to wield the chopsticks.  END
BEGIN NOW And either way, something about that disturbs me. END
BEGIN NOW This was not a restaurant with chopsticks at the table.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a napkin and a fork.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a place mat concealing the placemat underneath the glass on the table top with a print of the Chinese zodiac on it.  END
BEGIN NOW I read that I was born in the year of the rat.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the description is lost on me.  END
BEGIN NOW As far as the Chinese are concerned, I’m a rat.  END
BEGIN NOW I can never win with them.  END
BEGIN NOW At least with the western zodiac I’m a goat.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, according to the stars, I belong with the trash.  END
BEGIN NOW But I guess we have a saying about trash and treasure so all is not lost.  END
BEGIN NOW I find that it’s important to carry at least one book with me always.  END
BEGIN NOW When dining alone, the necessity is most certainly there.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea is to give the appearance of not being alone because that was your only option tonight, but rather you needed some space between all your engagements to grab a bite to eat and relax with a good book.  END
BEGIN NOW After what seems a good five minutes of me looking the menu over and the man behind the counter polishing glasses or counting something, he comes back around and to take my order.  END
BEGIN NOW  I could use some spring rolls and pot stickers and tea to start and some house special pork.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no further description.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s pork in it and that’s enough for me.  END
BEGIN NOW He asks me if I’d like some rice in a way that makes me think I’d be a fool not to.  END
BEGIN NOW I agree to the rice and continue reading. END
BEGIN NOW In the book, a young Italian sheepherder is having dinner with some aristocratic family for the first and only time during his employ.  END
BEGIN NOW The story is told from the perspective of the youngest boy in the family, being fairly close to the age of the sheepherder.  END
BEGIN NOW He describes the details of his awkward family and the class differences separating them and how the whole show is painfully awkward and ritualistic.  END
BEGIN NOW The story makes me glad that I am alone in a Chinese restaurant that doesn’t offer me chopsticks upon arrival with a book about eating with someone else’s family in a country I have never been to. END
BEGIN NOW The egg rolls arrive almost too hot to eat and tea that has yet to steep properly.  END
BEGIN NOW I take an eggroll and dip into a sauce of an almost absurdly red nature, a kind of too bright to be natural, goopy, slime of a sauce that coats the eggrolls like a layer of ruby silicone gel.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m too hungry to care about aesthetics and care only for getting some kind of sustenance into my empty since noon belly.  END
BEGIN NOW After the first one is down the hatch I turn my attention back to the book and read while absentmindedly eating the rest of fried to a golden brown cylinders stuffed with something that only the cook knows about.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple walks in.  END
BEGIN NOW When I say a couple your mind might jump to images of a man and woman.  END
BEGIN NOW You might have ideas about how old they are before I can lay the details on you.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t tell if the pair was composed of two men or a man and a very ugly woman.  END
BEGIN NOW One sounded slightly feminine, but not enough to persuade me to a definite conclusion.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d peg their ages around early fifties to late forties.  END
BEGIN NOW They walk straight up to the counter and make a to-go order without looking at the menu.  END
BEGIN NOW They then sat in semi-silence while waiting for a bag full of boxes to be bestowed upon them.  END
BEGIN NOW I ate and read.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the pot stickers showed up. END
BEGIN NOW The old man put down the plate on the table and walked away.  END
BEGIN NOW I said thank you and pushed the plate into position, waiting until the eggrolls were consumed before moving on.  END
BEGIN NOW The pot stickers held a hard sear on one side.  END
BEGIN NOW They were plump pockets of dough stuffed once again, with something indistinguishable.  END
BEGIN NOW The sauce was a kind of translucent black goo this time.  END
BEGIN NOW Not as sweet as the last one, more salty, maybe soy based with hints of something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW I continued eating and reading.  END
BEGIN NOW By this time, the tea has steeped properly and the color was getting darker by the pour.  END
BEGIN NOW I was up to three cups and the last one finished bitterly.  END
BEGIN NOW Around this time a woman walked in from somewhere in the back.  END
BEGIN NOW After a few minutes her relationship to the restaurant was obvious.  END
BEGIN NOW She was the owner’s wife.  END
BEGIN NOW  She bickers at the man behind the counter; at least I assume it was bickering.  END
BEGIN NOW  She was speaking a language I’m not at all familiar with, but the bickering pattern is one I know well enough.  END
BEGIN NOW She talked a lot and quickly, he responded sparsely with one or two word replies.  END
BEGIN NOW The old man brought me the pork and I never saw him again. END
BEGIN NOW The woman fixed a smile on her face when she saw me and immediately made sure my water glass never came close to empty.  END
BEGIN NOW She checked my tea and rice to see if I needed more.  END
BEGIN NOW She put music on the stereo and began straightening tables that no one had sat at for weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW She was either counting something behind the counter, or adjusting napkins, aligning the forks and napkins, or putting the tea cups in their place.  END
BEGIN NOW She must be a mother, I thought.  END
BEGIN NOW She even offered me a pair of chopsticks. END
BEGIN NOW She refilled everything before I could get in a word about how much more intake I could deal with.  END
BEGIN NOW I made the universal gesture for being full—rubbing my hand on my stomach and exhaling through pursed lips.  END
BEGIN NOW She asked if I would like a box to the remains in and I said yes, thank you.  END
BEGIN NOW  What was left of my meal appears much smaller when condensed to a traveling container.  END
BEGIN NOW She says thank you, good night at least twice.  END
BEGIN NOW She may have been sad to see me go.  END
BEGIN NOW I was the only customer that sat down to eat all night.  END
BEGIN NOW She may have needed someone to dote on while her husband was condemned to the back room to deal with the paper work.  END
BEGIN NOW    END
BEGIN NOW I received two fortune cookies along with my bill.  END
BEGIN NOW One told me of the onset of a new romantic interlude.  END
BEGIN NOW On the back were instructions for learning simple Chinese words.  END
BEGIN NOW On the back of this fortune was the Chinese word for ‘No’.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside again and with a full belly that will benefit greatly from the long walk home and a mind that has been grateful for an evening out, dining alone.  END
BEGIN NOW The cioppino was a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think in a small, port town with a name like Port Townsend, the seafood would be nothing short of transcendent.  END
BEGIN NOW If transcendence can be found in a motel room full of stomach cramps, bloating, and the rank toiling trouble burbling down below my belt, I must have missed it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve only seen my father cry twice.  END
BEGIN NOW Both times at funerals.  END
BEGIN NOW This time --number three-- he was on the phone to my Aunt Karen, who was also crying.  END
BEGIN NOW The death of my uncle was expected.  END
BEGIN NOW We knew about it.  END
BEGIN NOW He was supposed to have another month or two.  END
BEGIN NOW The service is tomorrow and my father has to read psalm 23 at mass.  END
BEGIN NOW At Our Lady of the Sea.  END
BEGIN NOW At a church in Port Townsend, Washington on the 22nd of October, 2009.  END
BEGIN NOW A Thursday. END
BEGIN NOW My guts hate me right now.  END
BEGIN NOW My guts have filed no less than three written complaints, all notarized and signed in triplicate.  END
BEGIN NOW All this sitting around in the car.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have walked to Washington.  END
BEGIN NOW My parents are sleeping in the same motel room.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s their 31st wedding anniversary.  END
BEGIN NOW Their anniversary will be marked, from now on, by the absence of my uncle.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother is watching a documentary on the queen of England.  END
BEGIN NOW Father’s reading the bible from the drawer where they keep bibles in motel rooms.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why he’s reading it.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think he knows either. END
BEGIN NOW Uncle Larry was a big man with a big laugh and a moustache that he must have been born with.  END
BEGIN NOW His ashes are to be scattered on the trails he blazed in the Pacific Northwest.  END
BEGIN NOW  He forged the Olympic trails with the Sierra Club crew.  END
BEGIN NOW He picked up trash on the highways around Port Ludlow where he lived for the last few years.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone gave him an orange vest, like the community service workers.  END
BEGIN NOW Something to spare him from the winding road traffic in small town Washington. END
BEGIN NOW This is the last night with my folks up here in the eternal fog of northwestern edge of the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not counting Alaska for practical reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t count Alaska as more than a defense post just in case Russia ever tries to make a comeback.  END
BEGIN NOW My folks have passed out in the bed next to mine.  END
BEGIN NOW A long day for them and a curfew of ten o’clock.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a little reading light to write by.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a few more pages of notebook to get whatever I can down before I can sleep. END
BEGIN NOW The church is high up on the hill in Port Townsend.  END
BEGIN NOW Up a few roads, past the lighthouse that doesn’t have a light anymore, past the fire station which would have more trouble trying to start a fire in this ever present dampness.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re a half hour early, which is normal for my folks; abnormal for me.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a preacher and an altar boy, they read some things.  END
BEGIN NOW I just look up at big dead statue Jesus on the cross.  END
BEGIN NOW Big statue Jesus with his hands frozen in blessing.  END
BEGIN NOW Big statuesque Mary holding statue baby Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW Frozen in infanthood. END
BEGIN NOW I can see the ferry pulling up to the dock in Bremerton.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a complimentary cup of coffee thanks to a Keurig promotional event at the dock.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a coffee place.  END
BEGIN NOW The weather is all about coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Strong, hot black coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to keep warm.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to stay dry. END
BEGIN NOW There was a piper at the wake.  END
BEGIN NOW If not for the piper, I wouldn’t have felt much of anything.  END
BEGIN NOW My uncle is all ashes in a can.  END
BEGIN NOW Could even be one of those cans that nice Scotches come in.  END
BEGIN NOW My aunt is wearing a tartan shawl, hugging and holding everyone in sight.  END
BEGIN NOW My father gets up to read psalm 23, each verse punctuated by a response from the crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW The people are mostly old folks, his sisters from Indiana.  END
BEGIN NOW My aunt’s brother Don, his two daughters.  END
BEGIN NOW Representatives from the Scottish American Military are here in their kilts, sporrans and hats. END
BEGIN NOW My father and I drink single malt in honor of my uncle.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re at a place called Sirens.  END
BEGIN NOW A siren, aside from the blaring ruckus emanating from emergency vehicles, is a vocalist that lures wayward sailors to their deaths.  END
BEGIN NOW Typically by dashing their ships against the rocks.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually a death by bludgeoning followed by drowning.  END
BEGIN NOW We drink it neat.  END
BEGIN NOW We avoid the rocks.  END
BEGIN NOW Tepid Scotch on a chilly day.  END
BEGIN NOW There was something like rain on the walk over here.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough to soak our hats and jackets.  END
BEGIN NOW Our spirits are being nourished by other spirits.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a fireplace in the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW The fire just far enough away that it’s only good for the flame.  END
BEGIN NOW The warmth long since dissipated before stretching long fiery fingers in our direction. END
BEGIN NOW The piper plays Amazing Grace.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother dabs her eyes with a tissue and passes it to my father.  END
BEGIN NOW Fred Willard guest stars as the priest.  END
BEGIN NOW Sounds like him, looks like him.  END
BEGIN NOW The priest won’t shut up about how my uncle was at peace because of god.  END
BEGIN NOW That because of god, my uncle had no regrets, no enemies, no wants or desires.  END
BEGIN NOW The priest says the word god at least sixty times in his eulogy.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather hear about how he’d sit his grandson, Gio, on his lap, tell him stories until he slept like the toddler he is.  END
BEGIN NOW How my uncle cussed out some guy on a rafting trip down the Colorado River once.  END
BEGIN NOW How my uncle would have rather been outside today.  END
BEGIN NOW Up on a hill somewhere, looking down at the Puget Sound.  END
BEGIN NOW The ashes are to be scattered along the Olympic trail in the spring.  END
BEGIN NOW A large Scotsman, thick as an accent, eyebrows big enough to hang a Sunday hat on, sings The Flowers of Scotland.  END
BEGIN NOW Another man steps up to the mic, harmonica in hand, plays You Take the High Road, can’t even make it through the song.  END
BEGIN NOW His voice cracks, my aunt sobs and shakes and wipes her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Another of the Scottish American Military steps up and tells how my uncle did him a favor once.  END
BEGIN NOW Stood as color guard when his father died.  END
BEGIN NOW Lent him his sporran.  END
BEGIN NOW My uncle would give up the skin on his back if you were cold.  END
BEGIN NOW I am on a boat.  END
BEGIN NOW A ferry, really.  END
BEGIN NOW Upper deck, back right.  END
BEGIN NOW Same place I’d sit if this were a bus.  END
BEGIN NOW The captain sounds much too chipper.  END
BEGIN NOW For some reason that worries me.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t expect anyone to be chipper at 9am.  END
BEGIN NOW Even on a Friday.  END
BEGIN NOW I have an hour on the boat before hitting ground again.  END
BEGIN NOW 2 hours to myself right after landing.  END
BEGIN NOW Might go busking.  END
BEGIN NOW Might do something.  END
BEGIN NOW Nowhere to smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW Washington is not a smoke friendly place.  END
BEGIN NOW Here is something I can’t understand.  END
BEGIN NOW Rain and fog and cloudy weather are the most delightful and rewarding conditions to smoke in. END
BEGIN NOW My uncle died of cancer.  END
BEGIN NOW Starting in his lungs.  END
BEGIN NOW Which is par for the course, I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW All my grandparents died the same way.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though my uncle wasn’t blood, it just seems like the way my family did, and will die.  END
BEGIN NOW My cousins are here, we haven’t seen each other in years.  END
BEGIN NOW Tony is in a sober living home until February or so.  END
BEGIN NOW Rose is a dispatch operator for the police.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes are too far apart on her face.  END
BEGIN NOW She must have amazing peripheral vision.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a fish.  END
BEGIN NOW Tony is built like he’s half Italian, half Scottish.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a bulldog.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing long sleeves to hide his tattoos.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been doing hard time for most of my adult life.  END
BEGIN NOW Something about meth.  END
BEGIN NOW His son is the youngest member of the family. END
BEGIN NOW It smells like popcorn on the ferry.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m full of eggs and potatoes from breakfast with my god brother.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s in the navy and his name is David.  END
BEGIN NOW Billy Joel wrote a line about him in the song that ruined his career.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t seen David since his wedding two years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW I was one of those people opposed to him joining the service.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he’s just pushing paper instead of pulling triggers.  END
BEGIN NOW His wife is young and in college.  END
BEGIN NOW They get to see each other for a few hours a day on good days.  END
BEGIN NOW Then he ships out and lives on a submarine for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Cruising underwater around the pacific, doing things he’s not allowed to talk about.  END
BEGIN NOW This makes conversation a cobweb of small talk with little dead flies of anecdotes every once in a while.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not terribly interested in anything I’ve been up to.  END
BEGIN NOW We went in opposite directions after high school.  END
BEGIN NOW Puget Sound is beautiful.  END
BEGIN NOW The autumnal assault of colored trees mixing with the evergreens on the hillsides.  END
BEGIN NOW Always rain coming down.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea breeze blowing and the ferry chugs along. END
BEGIN NOW After the wake, when all the friends have gone, the family goes out to dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW Some place called the Port Ludlow Resort.  END
BEGIN NOW Some place called The Fireside.  END
BEGIN NOW There are ten of us.  END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Karen, father, mother, Rose, Tony, the sisters Anne, Theresa, Catherine and Beth.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I’m here too.  END
BEGIN NOW I have little to say right now.  END
BEGIN NOW My father and I are drinking single malt again.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest are telling stories about Larry as a boy, Larry as a young man, Larry as a father and husband.  END
BEGIN NOW The man was a doer.  END
BEGIN NOW He did.  END
BEGIN NOW If a thing was out of place, he’d right it.  END
BEGIN NOW If something didn’t belong, he removed it.  END
BEGIN NOW He fixed, polished, cleaned, and organized.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a smiling moustache, a laughter that filled time and space.  END
BEGIN NOW A man now gone.  END
BEGIN NOW I always remember him smiling.  END
BEGIN NOW Always with a story.  END
BEGIN NOW If you told him that everything had already been done before, he’d say “then let’s do it again!” He believed in adventure.  END
BEGIN NOW In getting outside.  END
BEGIN NOW Moving, always.  END
BEGIN NOW Outdoors as often as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW He loved life and was on a mission to get the most out of it.  END
BEGIN NOW There never was a kinder, gentler man.  END
BEGIN NOW A man more at peace.  END
BEGIN NOW A man full to bursting with love and good nature. END
BEGIN NOW The ferry landed with a thud and a shudder.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone filed out of the boat and walked out into the rain and cold wind.  END
BEGIN NOW I flick ashes on the dock in Seattle.  END
BEGIN NOW I inhale and absorb my surroundings.  END
BEGIN NOW The skyscrapers, the low clouds, the smell of fish and salt water.  END
BEGIN NOW A row of gift shops all selling shot glasses and shirts with Seattle written all over them.  END
BEGIN NOW I wrap a scarf around my neck; pull my hat on tight, button all my buttons and take a long slow drag at my second to last cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW A few months from now, my uncle will be in the soil.  END
BEGIN NOW The soil with sprout a bush or a flower, a shrub or a tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Bits of my uncle will turn green and become leaves, roots, stems, stalks and petals.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t imagine him wanting anything else.  END
BEGIN NOW To be earth.  END
BEGIN NOW To be ash.  END
BEGIN NOW To fuel the cycle.  END
BEGIN NOW To keep things going.  END
BEGIN NOW  His moustache mingling with the pollen and the pine nettles up on a mountain somewhere in Washington.  END
BEGIN NOW A laugh can’t be incinerated.  END
BEGIN NOW His was the kind that wouldn’t fit in the chamber anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead it’s going to blow around the Olympic trail riding on the cold winds of northern Washington.  END
BEGIN NOW His laugh is going to dance with the fog horns and fishing boats, mingle with the hikers and bikers and trailblazers that pick up where he left off.  END
BEGIN NOW His laugh will fill the sails and push the leaves, lingering on everything he left behind.  END
BEGIN NOW Leaving everything a little lighter in his wake. END
BEGIN NOW Sandcastles END
BEGIN NOW I vividly remember the day her handwriting changed.  END
BEGIN NOW By coincidence it was the same day I'd grown tired of listening to the upstairs neighbors fucking.  END
BEGIN NOW Typically I'd home and they'd be at it.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd be tired and drunk and lie in bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Listening to the squeaks groans from upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW This happened twice a day.  END
BEGIN NOW The only times that I was ever home.  END
BEGIN NOW Namely before I slept and after I woke up. END
BEGIN NOW I woke on this particular morning to rain but not the sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the pleasant ambiance.  END
BEGIN NOW But the harsh reality of a broken umbrella and the down pour waiting outside the front door.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a sickly morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Starting around seven when I started coughing and ending around one when I was scheduled to rise and go to work.  END
BEGIN NOW I went to lock the door and found most my key still inside the door knob.  END
BEGIN NOW Broken off the night before. END
BEGIN NOW I called on the landlord who always seemed to be around anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed the lazy son of a well to do family.  END
BEGIN NOW No goals, no ambitions.  END
BEGIN NOW So his family--who I imagine had some money--set him up with an apartment building.  END
BEGIN NOW All he had to do was live there and fix broken keys and make sure everyone paid rent. END
BEGIN NOW I knocked on his door and he answered slightly unsure of whom I was and reluctant because he knew which apartment I lived in.  END
BEGIN NOW He motioned for his handyman to help me and they talked out of earshot in a language I didn’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW Forty-five minutes later the handy man came over to look at my door and pry the broken half of the key out.  END
BEGIN NOW It was then I decided to check the mail.  END
BEGIN NOW As I hoped, she had sent a letter.  END
BEGIN NOW The return address was the same as always.  END
BEGIN NOW But the writing was different.  END
BEGIN NOW I figured maybe she had to dictate it or maybe she had injured herself.  END
BEGIN NOW I had written her faithfully for sometime and it had been a few months since she responded.  END
BEGIN NOW I had been checking the mail in hopes of a letter from her for a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW Even on Sundays when I know the mail was not delivered.  END
BEGIN NOW But perhaps the letter carrier had odd hours and I missed the Saturday delivery. END
BEGIN NOW The tone of her letter was also odd.  END
BEGIN NOW Seemingly familiar but altogether different.  END
BEGIN NOW But her name was still signed at the bottom.  END
BEGIN NOW The opening sentences in the same apologetic manner as always. END
BEGIN NOW “Sorry I haven’t written in so long…” etc. END
BEGIN NOW “Life has been kinda crazy lately…” etc END
BEGIN NOW “Please forgive my delay…” etc END
BEGIN NOW I sat on the front step and smoked, reading her letter over a few times.  END
BEGIN NOW Typical response of little substance and shortly stated.  END
BEGIN NOW A response of two pages, single spaced, hand written to my last correspondence of eight pages edited three times and neatly hand printed with care. END
BEGIN NOW I placed her letter in my coat pocket and the handy man extracted my key.  END
BEGIN NOW Just soon enough for me to be late for work. END
BEGIN NOW She was one of those childhood friends that grew up and moved away only to return later.  END
BEGIN NOW Her return was dawn breaking.  END
BEGIN NOW Her second coming was fireworks.  END
BEGIN NOW She came back a butterfly. END
BEGIN NOW There was a time as children.  END
BEGIN NOW We were at the beach as children may.  END
BEGIN NOW Our mothers within sight sunning themselves and talking as mothers do. END
BEGIN NOW We had been making sandcastles, in a sense, I suppose, competitively.  END
BEGIN NOW She had hers and I had mine.  END
BEGIN NOW After the initial spree of building, of going as tall and grand as can be, we stopped to admire our architectural achievements.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she concluded that we were not complete.  END
BEGIN NOW She decided that our castles should meet and would be better as a single castle of magnificent scale. END
BEGIN NOW I remember mine would fall apart at times.  END
BEGIN NOW A tower here, sliding back into the beach.  END
BEGIN NOW A rampart there, dissolving into grainy lumps.  END
BEGIN NOW Each of these was carefully restored.  END
BEGIN NOW She giving strength; I adding artful touch. END
BEGIN NOW Then the tide came in. END
BEGIN NOW In our creative efforts we hardly noticed until the waves rolled up to our ankles.  END
BEGIN NOW We hurried to build a moat in order to control the water.  END
BEGIN NOW We built walls around our palace to protect our project from the slow flow of time. END
BEGIN NOW The moon majestically pulling apart everything we built. END
BEGIN NOW That was a long time ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Before her handwriting changed.  END
BEGIN NOW Before she came back and we started writing letters instead of building sandcastles. END
BEGIN NOW There was something unsettling about the letter.  END
BEGIN NOW The weight of it in my coat pocket was off.  END
BEGIN NOW The feel of the paper was foreign.  END
BEGIN NOW The ink a kind of sinister imposter.  END
BEGIN NOW The more I thought about it, the less it seemed real.  END
BEGIN NOW Like when a dream is vivid just after waking and the details fade into the day as the light replaces night and the rain keeps coming down erasing footprints and putting puddles in their place.  END
BEGIN NOW This was just after I had to leave for my own reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW The time seemed right and altogether a complete mistake, but I needed change and I needed new and I didn’t really know anything.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed like a time to start knowing.  END
BEGIN NOW And that could only happen by leaving in hopes of building my own cocoon from which to emerge at some kind of culmination.  END
BEGIN NOW In hopes of receiving some kind of growth or whatever it is that triggers change from what will be into what is now. END
BEGIN NOW The point is, she came back and then I left and we wrote letters to each other.  END
BEGIN NOW And one day her handwriting changed. END
BEGIN NOW … END
BEGIN NOW A new address always takes time for me to get used to.  END
BEGIN NOW For some reason I always have trouble remembering zip codes.  END
BEGIN NOW This new apartment is really only new to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Whoever was here before left little to no personal impression.  END
BEGIN NOW My room feels like a hotel room.  END
BEGIN NOW Like I’m only staying for a few nights and then the maid will come by in the morning with fresh towels and clean sheets and my brief history here will be erased by laundry detergent and bleach. END
BEGIN NOW The only traces I have of a previous occupant are the letters that come once a week. END
BEGIN NOW At first I thought they should be forwarded to her.  END
BEGIN NOW The letters were all addressed to a woman.  END
BEGIN NOW But the landlady said she left no information.  END
BEGIN NOW That she couldn’t be traced.  END
BEGIN NOW I waited two months for a solution before I started opening envelopes.  END
BEGIN NOW Each one seemed crafted, created with great care.  END
BEGIN NOW The words and sentences all lined up like neatly polished objects in a store window.  END
BEGIN NOW Each letter was signed with love.  END
BEGIN NOW Each one was dated and told stories from a life that seemed distant and tragic.  END
BEGIN NOW Confused and consistently chaotic.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a kind of sadness in them.  END
BEGIN NOW Sincere and honest and lacking.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always a sense that something was missing.  END
BEGIN NOW That something important was left out.  END
BEGIN NOW Only because it could not be included.  END
BEGIN NOW For whatever reason. END
BEGIN NOW I decided to write back after the letters continued coming.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why, but I pretended that I was the girl being written to.  END
BEGIN NOW In retrospect that was one of those decisions that usually ends badly.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to do something.  END
BEGIN NOW And I couldn’t bear to tell him that the woman he’d been writing had disappeared.  END
BEGIN NOW So I wrote back.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like I had been writing him all along.  END
BEGIN NOW At first it felt very unnatural.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not much of a letter writer myself.  END
BEGIN NOW After the first few, the process was easier.  END
BEGIN NOW After a while, it was something I did on weekends just as casually as making pancakes on Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW His letters were just so nice.  END
BEGIN NOW And he seemed to take such care in them.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a child making a house out of cards.  END
BEGIN NOW A house he will always take down and put back in the deck.  END
BEGIN NOW Cards that everyone else uses to gamble or play games.  END
BEGIN NOW Cards he sees great potential in.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if only through the eyes of a child that creates temporal things when left alone.  END
BEGIN NOW Lacking in a partner that would rather make him go fish.  END
BEGIN NOW Or go to war. END
BEGIN NOW There was a week when the letter didn’t come.  END
BEGIN NOW I checked the mailbox several times and it never came.  END
BEGIN NOW I took out a flashlight, thinking that maybe I had missed the feel of the envelope with my fingers and perhaps the paper had caught on some fold of metal. END
BEGIN NOW That weekend I couldn’t sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW I stayed awake in bed feeling tired and anxious.  END
BEGIN NOW Exhausted and restless.  END
BEGIN NOW That feeling that something far away had happened.  END
BEGIN NOW And the repercussions, the ripple from some stray raindrop would roll to shore as a wave strong enough to crush an entire kingdom. END
BEGIN NOW In the morning my consciousness finally faded out and I dreamed one of those dreams. END
BEGIN NOW I was in my parent’s house and the man who wrote the letters was there too, except he was not with me.  END
BEGIN NOW There was another woman by his side and I could never see their faces.  END
BEGIN NOW My parents doted on them, cooked them dinner, insisted they stay the night— in my old room.  END
BEGIN NOW I was to sleep in the guest room.  END
BEGIN NOW My mother remarked on nice they were.  END
BEGIN NOW How they seemed like peas in a pod.  END
BEGIN NOW Like peas and carrots.  END
BEGIN NOW She never acknowledged my presence. END
BEGIN NOW We had run out of food and my pen pal was still hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW The faceless woman found old bread—stale and decrepit.  END
BEGIN NOW Crusted with mold.  END
BEGIN NOW She drowned the bread in butter and threw it in the microwave. END
BEGIN NOW “This is terrible.” I thought to myself. END
BEGIN NOW I got a bowl and some flour, water, yeast, salt.  END
BEGIN NOW And as I was mixing the dough I looked down at my hands and woke up feeling like someone had been wringing out my stomach and tenderizing my chest with a mallet. END
BEGIN NOW I woke and got out of bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Only an hour had passed since I had slept.  END
BEGIN NOW I read the paper but only saw words on cheap newsprint.  END
BEGIN NOW I turned on the television and none of it made sense to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I opened the door and looked outside.  END
BEGIN NOW The parking lot was still there.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything was in its place and nothing seemed to belong where it was.  END
BEGIN NOW I walked out to my mailbox and opened it.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt eyes on me and across the street there was a figure watching. END
BEGIN NOW He looked weary, maybe homeless.  END
BEGIN NOW Disheveled hair and beard long neglected.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes sunk into his face like stones dropped in a river made of skin.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes watched my hands pull a letter from the mailbox.  END
BEGIN NOW I looked again and he sat down on the curb.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulled a bag of tobacco from his coat.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolled a cigarette with shaking fingers. END
BEGIN NOW I walked back to my apartment looking over my shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW He lit his cigarette and stared at the road.  END
BEGIN NOW At nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW At a rock long ago thrown into frozen water.  END
BEGIN NOW He got to his feet and walked away. END
BEGIN NOW Inside my apartment again I open a letter not addressed to me.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a single sentence on a single page. END
BEGIN NOW That was the last letter he wrote. END
BEGIN NOW That was the day his handwriting changed. END
BEGIN NOW The bus to San Jose will cost four dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW It will cost four dollars and take forty-five minutes of your life away.  END
BEGIN NOW  If you get the timing right, the sunset will come over the summit.  END
BEGIN NOW  The musky, moldy orange glow will grow darker.  END
BEGIN NOW Shades of violet will creep into the blue-orange-crushed velvet purple-getting darker-black.  END
BEGIN NOW The colors will cha-cha like two paint cloud partners becoming one with the music.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus will roar madcap down, down into the trees, leaning into every curve.  END
BEGIN NOW If you look out the window now there will be a blur of green branches.  END
BEGIN NOW If you look out the other side you will see a guard rail stained with carelessness.  END
BEGIN NOW  If you look ahead you will see a yellow broken yang line stretching and twisting down, down.  END
BEGIN NOW  Then the trees will thin out.  END
BEGIN NOW A reservoir will be spread out before you.  END
BEGIN NOW A dry beach, growing weeds awaiting winter rains will come and go on the left and right sides.  END
BEGIN NOW  And then all that will be left is freeway.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but concrete and steel.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a good time to read.  END
BEGIN NOW  The sneaking suspicion that this bus was not going to make it around all of those curves is gone.  END
BEGIN NOW  You can officially relax. END
BEGIN NOW The next time you look up there’s a dancing pig in neon lights.  END
BEGIN NOW  Pure Pork Sausage.  END
BEGIN NOW  This is when you know you’ve reached the station.  END
BEGIN NOW  The train station is always a train station.  END
BEGIN NOW  There are pews like a church in neat little rows.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s an alter, behind which stands the dispenser of train tickets and information.  END
BEGIN NOW In the back are restrooms and a small gift shop.  END
BEGIN NOW If you need change the time is now.  END
BEGIN NOW  If you need refreshment, now is the time.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have needs, make sure they are met and do it quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW  The bus you need will leave, just like Bono sang, with or without you.  END
BEGIN NOW  The bus you need is the 180 Express to Fremont.  END
BEGIN NOW It will take longer than the train, but the train doesn’t run for at least thirty more minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW It is officially dusk now.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun is completely gone and only a highlighted after thought on the horizon remains.  END
BEGIN NOW  Now it’s the city’s turn to brighten up.  END
BEGIN NOW The street lights, the bar signs, the headlights, the billboards all come to attention.  END
BEGIN NOW  They all shine brighter; the Earth turns her back on the Sun, twisting into darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW You can lean your head against the window.  END
BEGIN NOW You always sit at the back corner, right side preferred, giving you a seat for your feet and some head space.	The silent city seen through a bus window passing you by; the hum and blur of broken buildings, broken homes, and shattered dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW All of it just outside your window.  END
BEGIN NOW When you arrive in Fremont at the Bart station, you will have to make a few serious decisions.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a restroom here, a drinking fountain, and a hot dog vendor.  END
BEGIN NOW  This may be a tricky operation.  END
BEGIN NOW It will take careful consideration and clever timing to make everything go smoothly.  END
BEGIN NOW  Impulsively you buy a hot dog.  END
BEGIN NOW  The menu offers hot dogs, super hot dogs and polish sausage.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything will cost three-fifty.  END
BEGIN NOW  German engineering and Polish sensibilities.  END
BEGIN NOW  All nestled in a steamed bun.  END
BEGIN NOW Life is short and time is precious.  END
BEGIN NOW You only live once.  END
BEGIN NOW You make sure he puts everything on it.  END
BEGIN NOW You did almost die on the bus ride over.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only fair to yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s three-fifty well spent.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s three dollars and fifty cents closer to nirvana then you will ever be for the rest of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW Savor that sausage.  END
BEGIN NOW Pure pork sausage, probably.  END
BEGIN NOW You can smoke or toke or stretch for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Use the restroom, drink from the fountain.  END
BEGIN NOW The hard part is over.  END
BEGIN NOW  On the platform there is one train.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the end of the line.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s only turning back for these trains.  END
BEGIN NOW Retrace your tracks.  END
BEGIN NOW Go back from whence ye came.  END
BEGIN NOW The life of a train is nothing but constant rejection.  END
BEGIN NOW No one ever wants you to hang around.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people will come and see you, but they always leave.  END
BEGIN NOW You will always spend the night alone if you are a train.  END
BEGIN NOW  The only friends a train will ever have are an assortment of familiar strangers. END
BEGIN NOW You enter the doors for Richmond bound train.  END
BEGIN NOW It is Sunday, and all the trains from this station will go to Richmond.  END
BEGIN NOW This is good.  END
BEGIN NOW Your chances of fucking this up are slim to none.  END
BEGIN NOW All you have to do is get off at the right time.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just a matter of waiting, watching, and waving goodbye.  END
BEGIN NOW  All you have to do now is wait until you hear, “Next stop, Ashby.  END
BEGIN NOW Ashby station.” Please stand clear of the doors.  END
BEGIN NOW The doors are closing.  END
BEGIN NOW Please stand clear of the doors.  END
BEGIN NOW It is inevitable that at some point along this line, at some station on this map, a very fat woman will sit down in your car.  END
BEGIN NOW This will always be a mystery to you.  END
BEGIN NOW Every train, every time.  END
BEGIN NOW The fat woman will find you.  END
BEGIN NOW And she will read her supermarket bought, paperback book.  END
BEGIN NOW Checkout aisle fiction.  END
BEGIN NOW She will have glasses on the edge of her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of glasses with straps, so as not to fall from her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She will eye you indifferently.  END
BEGIN NOW She will read again. END
BEGIN NOW The train is smooth enough to allow you to write.  END
BEGIN NOW A ballpoint, a notebook and a seat to yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW The only thing missing, that would make this ideal, is a beverage service.  END
BEGIN NOW At the very least allowance to drink on the train.  END
BEGIN NOW If only, maybe someday, maybe later.  END
BEGIN NOW You sit facing the end of the train, watching everything fade away from you.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside the sprawl becomes denser.  END
BEGIN NOW The freeways and highways and streets mingle with factories, warehouses and low income housing.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no wrong side to the tracks.  END
BEGIN NOW They are equal in their depravity.  END
BEGIN NOW If there were still sunlight you could see a maze of paint running along the fences and sides of buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW Hundreds of names and slogans.  END
BEGIN NOW Along the roads and off ramps, the glow of a thousand lights, the buzz and hum of a million voices all come together at the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW All that noise crosses the bridges; the major arteries and veins, pumping people in and out of city you left your heart in.  END
BEGIN NOW  You will hear the words, “Next stop, Lake Merritt.  END
BEGIN NOW  Lake Merritt station.” When you hear those words the view and the city and the sky will be replaced by your own reflection.  END
BEGIN NOW This is when you will smile at yourself and remember that you should be writing something. END
BEGIN NOW You are almost home.  END
BEGIN NOW Ashby is right after MacArthur.  END
BEGIN NOW Ashby is the next underground after the MacArthur breath of air station.  END
BEGIN NOW The train dives back into the earth and you emerge moments later.  END
BEGIN NOW The air will be crisp as autumn air should be.  END
BEGIN NOW It will not be cold or warm; it will be the temperature of transition.  END
BEGIN NOW Your baggage will be heavy and painful on your shoulders.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten more minutes of walking and you will be home.  END
BEGIN NOW You take Ashby down to Sacramento.  END
BEGIN NOW You will pass the Malcolm X Elementary School.  END
BEGIN NOW This means you went in the right direction on Ashby.  END
BEGIN NOW Congratulate yourself; you don’t have to turn around.  END
BEGIN NOW You will make a right on Sacramento.  END
BEGIN NOW From here you will walk past Julia Street.  END
BEGIN NOW Then you will see Russell and that’s where you turn in.  END
BEGIN NOW The lock on the gate will be broken, which is useful since you will not have a key.  END
BEGIN NOW You will walk up to the door of apartment 15 and it will open for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside the apartment, the roommate will talk to a moth that only mumbles, ruminating over a small pile of resin.  END
BEGIN NOW You are home now, and you can finally relax. END
BEGIN NOW It might have been day three, or week three or year three.  END
BEGIN NOW The point is that I stumbled home and in the door and no one was there.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially after I walked in. END
BEGIN NOW It had been, it will be, it continues on as one of those stretches of time marked by nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW By nothing of significance.  END
BEGIN NOW By not a goddamn bit of anything of any importance whatsoever.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially not to anyone worth mentioning.  END
BEGIN NOW I found myself lying face down in the bed, in between a stain of dubious origin and bit of stray ashes from an unknown time period.  END
BEGIN NOW The ashes were probably from a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW I might have smoked it before saluting consciousness in a mock gesture of farewell.  END
BEGIN NOW As if I may never see it again.  END
BEGIN NOW Like we were both going separate ways.  END
BEGIN NOW That we may never meet afterward.  END
BEGIN NOW  Should I be so lucky.  END
BEGIN NOW That is not to say that I was planning on dying, in any real sense of the word.  END
BEGIN NOW At least, not any time soon.  END
BEGIN NOW More so that I felt disenfranchised from life and that these things happened around me regardless of any effort on my part whatsoever.  END
BEGIN NOW That the bed would continue collecting stains, from me or the ceiling, or maybe even the floor should there be a flooding, or some other misfortune inflicted in the general direction of the mattress I claimed as home.  END
BEGIN NOW The days would continue to pass with not so much as a recognizable sound bite that couldn’t be salvage later when a similar event transpired.  END
BEGIN NOW With or without me.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything will and would continue just as it had before me.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as it will when I’m gone.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a feeling, a sense of, I suppose, abandonment.  END
BEGIN NOW  I liken it to being trapped in a well.  END
BEGIN NOW Although I have never had the pleasure of such an experience firsthand.  END
BEGIN NOW I imagine it to be cold and dark and damp.  END
BEGIN NOW I imagine that light is only manifest as a pin prick of dim flecks of the sun that pass overhead.  END
BEGIN NOW That everyone and thing passes overhead like a far away event.  END
BEGIN NOW As if watching a movie without sound through a pair of out of focus binoculars centered on a drive-in theater in the distance.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about where i was.  END
BEGIN NOW Face down in the mattress of a movie that was five miles away. END
BEGIN NOW This story isn’t about me, but I’m going to see what I can do to make it about me. END
BEGIN NOW I heard the front door open and close.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound had to walk across the street and up the steps before reaching my ears.  END
BEGIN NOW He was my roommate.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a tendency to keep his distance from the noises he made.  END
BEGIN NOW He flung my door open, increasing the doorknob indentation in the wall just a little more.  END
BEGIN NOW In his right hand was half a pint of plastic bottle whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW In his left hand was bent cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW “I was going to save this for a special occasion.  END
BEGIN NOW Like waking up tomorrow.” He said.  END
BEGIN NOW He tossed the bottle at my head and went to piss in the bathroom.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottle made a kind of klud noise with a slush at the end.  END
BEGIN NOW He left the door open, talking in between the stream. END
BEGIN NOW “You know…” he paused for effect, letting the downpour echo into the toilet. END
BEGIN NOW “Not really,” I mumbled. END
BEGIN NOW “You know what you are?” He shook his member, draining the last drizzle of digested liquid into the bowl. END
BEGIN NOW “I haven’t the faintest idea.” I turned my head, almost accepting this conversation. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re the epitome of pity me.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s kind of pathetic.” He flushed and didn’t bother to wash his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW He claimed that his penis was the cleanest part of his body.  END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks,” I said, turning my head to examine the other wall. END
BEGIN NOW “That’s not a compliment.  END
BEGIN NOW Drink up, you’ll feel less shitty for a little while.” He was leaning in my doorway.  END
BEGIN NOW I propped myself up on my elbows and groped around for the bottle in the darkness of late afternoon with all the blinds drawn.  END
BEGIN NOW I found it and put it to my lips until it was light and empty.  END
BEGIN NOW  I threw the bottle back at him and coughed for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW He caught it and chuckled, throwing the bottle at the wall near the trashcan.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed by a good foot but that wasn’t a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW He walked to the living room and flopped on a couch. END
BEGIN NOW “The day is still young, let’s do some damage.” He was rolling another cigarette on his stomach. END
BEGIN NOW His name was Bernard but he went by Bern.  END
BEGIN NOW I met him the third time I went to college.  END
BEGIN NOW We started living together after everyone else we knew proved unreasonable in domestic situations.  END
BEGIN NOW  We maintained a friendship that was based mostly on our abilities to remain completely indifferent in times when most people panicked or became prone to acts of drama.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t consider either of us to be sane or rational.  END
BEGIN NOW We could say ‘fuck it’ to damn near anything.  END
BEGIN NOW “There’s a mariachi band in the shower.  END
BEGIN NOW Only when the water’s running though.  END
BEGIN NOW I keep hearing horns.” I mumbled through the aftermath of cheap whiskey on the way down. END
BEGIN NOW “You fascinate me.  END
BEGIN NOW Put some fucking shoes on.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s get out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t sit in the house for more than an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s get sneaky petes and climb the hill to catch the sunset over the bay.” He smoked in such a way that half a cloud would escape; seem to regret the action and retreat back into his mouth for another go. END
BEGIN NOW “Fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Roll me a smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW I require motivation before motivating.” I sat up and put my feet on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW The hard wood was cold on my soles.  END
BEGIN NOW I reached around for socks.  END
BEGIN NOW I found shoes and a jacket.  END
BEGIN NOW I closed the door and he tossed the cigarette at me.  END
BEGIN NOW He threw the lighter and I lit up and tossed it back. END
BEGIN NOW “Liquor store on Shattuck is cheaper for some reason, let’s get.” The front door was already open and his sunglasses were already on.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a few steps ahead of me.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always a few steps ahead of me. END
BEGIN NOW We locked the door and checked the mailbox and started walking north-west.  END
BEGIN NOW Up and out of the ghetto. END
BEGIN NOW Part 2 END
BEGIN NOW The guy at the liquor store checked both of our IDs.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t like our looks.  END
BEGIN NOW Said I didn’t look like the guy in the picture.  END
BEGIN NOW He said the guy in the picture had a beard.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t have a beard.  END
BEGIN NOW I had shaved a few days before.  END
BEGIN NOW He started a relationship with me based on resentment.  END
BEGIN NOW We took a liter of Coke and a pint of Jack.  END
BEGIN NOW Paper bagging up the suburban streets lined with trees doing that thing that trees do in spring.  END
BEGIN NOW  Blooming, they call it.  END
BEGIN NOW We took turns drinking the Coke until it was half empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Bern thinned it out with the whiskey and we passed it around again. END
BEGIN NOW The suburbs were lined with cars that cost more the further up we went.  END
BEGIN NOW Two increases converging simultaneously on streets.  END
BEGIN NOW A duel incline.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW We didn’t talk much.  END
BEGIN NOW There wasn’t much need to.  END
BEGIN NOW There was enough going on with spring and dusk creeping around the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW Long shadows and a deadline to get up before the sun went down on the ocean like a luminous head bobbing for apples in a vast liquid emerald bucket.  END
BEGIN NOW The inclined increased and the contents of the coke bottle decreased and we, the both of us, made a transition from mutual apathy to comforting numbness.  END
BEGIN NOW The feeling of not feeling.  END
BEGIN NOW We took turns rolling cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Bern told me about a girl he kept running into, but they were both too chicken-shit to do anything reasonable about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like say, “Hi.” At the very least.  END
BEGIN NOW He said every time she came around he was too surprised or too occupied with something else to deal with it.  END
BEGIN NOW “It’s a sign, dude.” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re going to have to talk to her sometime or she’ll never go away.  END
BEGIN NOW Or she’ll go away too soon and you’ll be regretting not saying anything.  END
BEGIN NOW If you recognize her by now, she probably recognizes you.” I coughed and spat on the sidewalk. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, you’re probably right.  END
BEGIN NOW But I have the worst timing.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s unbelievable.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m always a few minutes too late or too early.  END
BEGIN NOW This has been a consistent problem all my conscious life.” He drew in smoke and let it go for a half second before sucking it back in. END
BEGIN NOW We walked with long strides up the hill in a zigzag pattern.  END
BEGIN NOW We passed Telegraph and Bancroft.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottle was getting dangerously low.  END
BEGIN NOW Whiskey can fake a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW In all my years of amateur film criticism, in all the countless hours I’ve spent analyzing theater, infomercials, and my mother, I’ve seen some beautiful smiles forced on Broadway caliber faces.  END
BEGIN NOW Whiskey could nail it.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me half a bottle and there will be a grin waiting for me at the bottom.  END
BEGIN NOW  I blame it on the contented absence of feeling.  END
BEGIN NOW When the whiskey is gone, all you can do is hope whatever was triggering the shit inside is receding like a hairline mimicking the career of a door to door salesman.  END
BEGIN NOW Like an obviously outnumbered army with half a brain seeing the coalescence of forces on the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW Retreating, they call it. END
BEGIN NOW “You know that saying, ‘the lights are on but no one is home’? I feel like I’m home but the power is out and I keep running in to the furniture.” Bern pulled the empty bottle from his pocket and threw it at a tree with gusto.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of breaking glass made the finality of whiskey a tangible reality. END
BEGIN NOW We passed by the football stadium.  END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, you’re quiet today.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, you’ve been quiet for like a month now.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s up?” Bern rolled another cigarette as he spoke, packing the tobacco in with his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno man, remember that one girl? The bookworm that could talk and talk and talk? I’m still trying to get over her.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m getting older, I can’t keep this up, you know? And I feel like I’m playing out this pattern.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the same every time.  END
BEGIN NOW Meet a girl, girl has boyfriend, girl leads me on, then she fades away without a word.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m fucking sick of it.” I took a drag of the cigarette and spat on the concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW We walked up the hill and through the parking lot to the forest to the trail that leads to the lookout spot.  END
BEGIN NOW “At least it wasn’t tragic this time.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think I could deal with another girl calling me from the hospital on suicide watch.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah…” Bern started up a trail through the woods to a log that was just right for perching on when the sun was setting.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither of us was much for relationship advice or relationships in general.  END
BEGIN NOW It was problematic in a sense that we made a problem of it.  END
BEGIN NOW There were problems of a more immediate nature.  END
BEGIN NOW Like money and finding work and keeping food around.  END
BEGIN NOW But women.  END
BEGIN NOW Women were always of more concern for some reason.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’s life in your twenties for guys that were raised backwards from a social perspective.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t talk to strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t have sex before you’re married.  END
BEGIN NOW Stay in school.  END
BEGIN NOW Graduate and you’ll get a better job.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t drink or do drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking will kill you.  END
BEGIN NOW Strangers will kill you.  END
BEGIN NOW Be scared, be quiet, stay out of trouble. END
BEGIN NOW But trouble turned out to be fun.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking became a form of solace.  END
BEGIN NOW Drinking helped us talk to strangers and meet girls.  END
BEGIN NOW School was like taking the A train to Debt.  END
BEGIN NOW Drugs could open the mind and tilt perspective and open the flood gates to all kinds of crazy experiences.  END
BEGIN NOW The economy went belly up again and the only jobs available were trade jobs.  END
BEGIN NOW Construction, food service, manual labor.  END
BEGIN NOW Always necessary, but still taking a hit.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone I knew that actually graduated decided to lay low in grad school until things got better.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything we knew was wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything we were taught was horrendously out of date.  END
BEGIN NOW The world was changing, life was changing, and society was constantly evolving.  END
BEGIN NOW So we drank and swapped ideas for getting out of the poverty line.  END
BEGIN NOW We walked up hills and caught a view to put everything in perspective.  END
BEGIN NOW We moved on from one dead end job to the next and it never made a dick of difference.  END
BEGIN NOW We hit the log just in time.  END
BEGIN NOW The clouds over the city were drifting down to the ocean and the sun was making a dive for it.  END
BEGIN NOW The color of the sky shifted from orange and pink to purple blue and darker blue until near black.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the stars would pop into view on the opposite side of the sky.  END
BEGIN NOW We rolled cigarettes and sucked the last drop of Jack and Coke from the bottle, tossing it onto the forest floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Bern would open his mouth to start a syllable that would start a sentence then rethink the thought and take another drag of his cigarette, catching the smoke with his breath and taking it into the folds of his mouth for one last hurrah.  END
BEGIN NOW We smoked dusk into ashes and flicked the butts into the half assed darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be another one of those nights.  END
BEGIN NOW  It will be more like another one of those mornings.  END
BEGIN NOW The ceiling will be as dark as ever.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside your window, the street lights will glow pale jack-o-lantern orange.  END
BEGIN NOW The clocks and your watch all tell you the same thing.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s around five thirty.  END
BEGIN NOW Your body aches and stretches and refuses to find comfort.  END
BEGIN NOW Your mind and your body will be at war.  END
BEGIN NOW The brain struggling to stop a minute and rest up.  END
BEGIN NOW The body in complete agreement, feeling all pins and pin cushion.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither one will know how to cope with this.  END
BEGIN NOW Both will have their ideas and methods.  END
BEGIN NOW None of them will work.  END
BEGIN NOW They will seem to be trying opposing tactics.  END
BEGIN NOW Your body will twist like a frozen ballerina gone horizontal.  END
BEGIN NOW Your head will try and rest a cheek on the pillow despite the direction of your neck.  END
BEGIN NOW You will adjust blankets, flip things around.  END
BEGIN NOW Rearrange.  END
BEGIN NOW Feng shui yourself so many times that eventually the hopelessness of your situation will be all you have left.  END
BEGIN NOW This is when you get up.  END
BEGIN NOW Stretch your legs like something meaningful happened to them over the last few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW  Realize that you didn’t even register a decent nap.  END
BEGIN NOW Your stomach will be the first to complain.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be sour and empty, bloated and bemoaning.  END
BEGIN NOW You will walk to the bathroom, and turn on the faucet.  END
BEGIN NOW Water will wash over your hands, and you will use that water to splash at your face.  END
BEGIN NOW The mirror is not your friend right now.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only telling you things you don’t want to hear.  END
BEGIN NOW You try the shower.  END
BEGIN NOW You wait.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but cold.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even a hint of temperature change.  END
BEGIN NOW The hot water heater is all fucked up.  END
BEGIN NOW This is how your morning starts. END
BEGIN NOW You have two dollars and sixty cents on a left over Bart card.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s eight dollars and twenty five cents in the change receptacle.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Just maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Clothes are changed to maintain the illusion of freshness.  END
BEGIN NOW A light bag is packed with just the essentials for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW Shoes are tied, a hat is found.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this without making a sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t want to wake the roommate.  END
BEGIN NOW He does sleep in the living room after all.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no need to be an inconsiderate asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just because you can’t sleep doesn’t mean other people need to suffer.  END
BEGIN NOW Also don’t forget the mints on the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW Those will be your only source of nourishment for the duration of the trip. END
BEGIN NOW In your possession are one book bag, contents being: one large notebook for writing, one notebook computer, one novel with dog eared pages, one small  otebook for note keeping, a CalTrain schedule, a checkbook, an old menu, and one condom.  END
BEGIN NOW You were a boy scout once.  END
BEGIN NOW Be prepared and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW You also carry a nearly empty duffel bag.  END
BEGIN NOW The duffel bag is mostly for the return trip.  END
BEGIN NOW  For carrying some leftover possessions from friend’s houses.  END
BEGIN NOW Random debris from living in between homes.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a light trip and there’s going to be some foot work involved.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t want to strain yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be completely unnecessary. END
BEGIN NOW You are bundled in triple layers with thick, wool socks.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only just before six.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s still as dark as you remember.  END
BEGIN NOW  The walk down Sacramento will be brief and uneventful.  END
BEGIN NOW Your eyes will peel the ground for loose change, hopefully a stray dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything that might be of use right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Legs move at a steady march.  END
BEGIN NOW Left foot right foot up Ashby.  END
BEGIN NOW Right side of the road.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s where the station is.  END
BEGIN NOW Right across the chain link fence.  END
BEGIN NOW The construction is finally done, no need for a detour.  END
BEGIN NOW The early risers set up for a flea market.  END
BEGIN NOW  Could have sworn that was a Sunday operation, but no matter.  END
BEGIN NOW Old people with their pickup trucks unpack wares on to folding tables.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t seem groggy.  END
BEGIN NOW They are not fazed by the hour and the darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW This is puzzling to your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW How do they do it? What’s the secret? Where were you when they handed out the brochures on how to maintain at six in the morning on a Saturday…? You must have been sleeping.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be a reasonable assumption.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be perfectly understandable given your history of Saturdays.  END
BEGIN NOW But no matter.  END
BEGIN NOW The train awaits. END
BEGIN NOW The station is quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW There are a total of three other people here.  END
BEGIN NOW No one says anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone just stares with vacant eyes at nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW A pigeon mingles around.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s the life of the party.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks up to you.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at you, bobbing his head to a silent beat.  END
BEGIN NOW You like the guy.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s got moxie.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t think much of you and he moves on.  END
BEGIN NOW The sting of rejection comes in waves.  END
BEGIN NOW It echoes every time you hear, “Fremont train in six minutes.” “Fremont train in four minutes.” Reassurance.  END
BEGIN NOW Moving on.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon there will be a seat.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon you can sit down again in a moving box racing along a track at the speed of light through predawn darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a light at the beginning of the tunnel.  END
BEGIN NOW The guttural roar of several tons of steel pushing air through a subterranean tube.  END
BEGIN NOW The wind pipe of the world projectile vomiting mass transit right in front of you. END
BEGIN NOW Fremont bound train.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a Fremont bound train.  END
BEGIN NOW The doors are closing.  END
BEGIN NOW Please stand clear of the doors.  END
BEGIN NOW This will be your mantra for an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW Commit it to memory.  END
BEGIN NOW Repeat it softly to yourself like a prayer.  END
BEGIN NOW Hail Bart Train full of sleepy eyed end of shift civilians.  END
BEGIN NOW I am with thee.  END
BEGIN NOW Take comfort in this.  END
BEGIN NOW These are your people.  END
BEGIN NOW The mailman rests in the seat across from you.  END
BEGIN NOW The off duty security guard reading a romance novel.  END
BEGIN NOW The couple behind you, keeping conversation in order to avoid nodding off.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside the window lies the void.  END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the window a vast field of ink.  END
BEGIN NOW  The train emerges into the Oakland streets running alongside MLK.  END
BEGIN NOW Rows of streetlights cut through the ink giving the outline of roads and sleepy urban shops.  END
BEGIN NOW Along the hillside little dots of oranges and yellows like pinpricks in a giant rolling hump of blackness.  END
BEGIN NOW If you tilt your head uncomfortably you can see the beginning of dawn coming up.  END
BEGIN NOW The band of morning tuning up their instruments in the pit before the stage of the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite the discomfort in straining your neck to see, you feel it’s vital to keep a close eye on the proceedings.  END
BEGIN NOW Not often enough are the chances to see a sunrise from the train.  END
BEGIN NOW What amazes right now is how unlike a sunset this is.  END
BEGIN NOW If the earth is a big spinning ball, rotating in a vacuum with other spheres of gravitational influence, then should a sunrise and sunset look the same? But the light changes when it comes and goes.  END
BEGIN NOW The clouds will alter the course of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything affects everything else. END
BEGIN NOW You can hear the strings start softly on the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW The cellos and violas weaving a tapestry of light in iridescent oranges with purple hues.  END
BEGIN NOW  The first violin begins to lead in flames.  END
BEGIN NOW A fire dance of seven veils rising from the east.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this seems to move slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW Agonizing tension building up behind the hills, waiting to ejaculate in a crescendo of full symphonic sunlight.  END
BEGIN NOW And this is all background noise. END
BEGIN NOW The foreground hubbub is MacArthur station.  END
BEGIN NOW Last chance transfer point.  END
BEGIN NOW The train runs parallel with another, coming into the station chasing a reflection.  END
BEGIN NOW The people hurry in and out.  END
BEGIN NOW Split second dodging to make it through the doors in time.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone with their baggage.  END
BEGIN NOW Suitcases, book bags, briefcases, backpacks.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone with a place to be and things to do.  END
BEGIN NOW The doors are closing.  END
BEGIN NOW Please stand clear of the doors. END
BEGIN NOW Again, again through the sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW Along a rail floating over the city.  END
BEGIN NOW District to district, station to station.  END
BEGIN NOW The streets are lit with a pale tease, the sun being fashionably late and always right on time.  END
BEGIN NOW Parking lots and warehouse mingle with the suburbs.  END
BEGIN NOW Barber shops and nail salons.  END
BEGIN NOW And all those liquor stores.  END
BEGIN NOW Lake Merritt to Fruitvale.  END
BEGIN NOW The Coliseum to San Leandro.  END
BEGIN NOW Bay Fair transfer point.  END
BEGIN NOW Hayward to South Hayward and Union City.  END
BEGIN NOW Then Fremont with dead fields and dead ends. END
BEGIN NOW While the city speeds by underneath you the sky turns bright as a light bulb in the belly of a suffocated baby blue.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun peaks over the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW The old bastard moves slowly for the first few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Stretching his arms while getting the chariot ready.  END
BEGIN NOW Good old grandfather Sun.  END
BEGIN NOW Always apollonic in his race across the heavens.  END
BEGIN NOW You will hear “Fremont, Fremont station.  END
BEGIN NOW End of the line.” Check everything.  END
BEGIN NOW  A Bart train is a terrible place to lose something.  END
BEGIN NOW If you linger any longer you will once more hear “The doors are closing.  END
BEGIN NOW Please stand clear of the doors.” And out you go into the rapidly warming morning.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s still cold enough to warrant three layers, and now you could use those sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW  You walk down the stairs and slip your card into the slot on the turnstile.  END
BEGIN NOW It will blink at you in red letters and reject your card.  END
BEGIN NOW You do not have enough money to make it through.  END
BEGIN NOW The thought of passing right behind someone, or under the mechanical gates crosses your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW The guard might look away long enough.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ve done this before. END
BEGIN NOW For some reason this seems like a bad idea right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Reluctantly you extract the bag full of coins that was supposed to be bus fare.  END
BEGIN NOW You need one dollar and forty cents to make the turnstile happy.  END
BEGIN NOW You figure this is a good chance to use up the nickels.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to count out nickels in the line for the bus would be a pain in everyone’s ass.  END
BEGIN NOW But here there is no line and no driver.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a machine for taking your money and turning it into an exit visa. END
BEGIN NOW Being outside the station will be refreshing.  END
BEGIN NOW The air will be crisp and cool.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun is making great leaps in the sky.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s well off the horizon when you look again.  END
BEGIN NOW Time to sit down again and count your change.  END
BEGIN NOW Separate into two places for each bus.  END
BEGIN NOW Three fifty for the San Jose bound bus.  END
BEGIN NOW Four dollars for the seventeen express.  END
BEGIN NOW Why it’s called an express bus will be a mystery.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no non-express seventeen bus.  END
BEGIN NOW It seems an unnecessary extension.  END
BEGIN NOW And any bus that takes forty minutes never feels quite like an express trip.  END
BEGIN NOW Who names and numbers the buses? How do you get that job? What kind of qualifications would you list on a resume for such a thing? END
BEGIN NOW You are seventy-five cents short.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no other coinage at your disposal.  END
BEGIN NOW There is another way.  END
BEGIN NOW By the entrance to the station there’s a man selling hot dogs.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s setting up shop now.  END
BEGIN NOW A reminder of just how early it really is.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s filling chests full of ice and beverages.  END
BEGIN NOW Future passengers mingle, smoke, sit, meander in circles.  END
BEGIN NOW This is why you brought the hat.  END
BEGIN NOW The hat hits the concrete by the steps of the station.  END
BEGIN NOW You pull out a C harp from your coat pocket and start warming up.  END
BEGIN NOW You play up and down, checking all the notes for clarity.  END
BEGIN NOW Making sure no lint is stuck in the reeds.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything sounds about right.  END
BEGIN NOW The draw for the three hole is a little too tight, but no matter.  END
BEGIN NOW Just bend the shit out of it and hope for the best. END
BEGIN NOW You start with a basic blues riff.  END
BEGIN NOW Add a little rhythm and start improvising.  END
BEGIN NOW Play off an idea; throw in hints of other songs.  END
BEGIN NOW Speed it up a little.  END
BEGIN NOW Slow it down.  END
BEGIN NOW Blow soft high notes and put some soul into it.  END
BEGIN NOW Take it to train noises.  END
BEGIN NOW A chugging beat and a whistle blow.  END
BEGIN NOW Wail on that harp like you really need seventy-five cents.  END
BEGIN NOW Let your breath and your lips sing a sad song and take it back to melody that could begin with the words, I woke up this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Run a few lazy circles around the notes and always take it back home.  END
BEGIN NOW Toy with concepts.  END
BEGIN NOW Sprinkle some familiar themes in.  END
BEGIN NOW Use your tongue to block one hole while sucking a mean shuddering bend from the two on either side.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone will start paying attention if you do this right. END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes of this have gone by.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a man in purple shirt, reading a paper.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks over and drops a folded one dollar bill into your hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Mission accomplished.  END
BEGIN NOW Fare has been taken care of.  END
BEGIN NOW You decide to keep playing for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus won’t be here for another twenty minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW You might as well try and make a little extra.  END
BEGIN NOW You switch to an old G harp with a cracked comb.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound is deeper and resonates at a lower frequency.  END
BEGIN NOW  The song escaping into morning air is just a traveling song, always in transition.  END
BEGIN NOW Rambling along right by your side.  END
BEGIN NOW The one eighty express pulls up to the station.  END
BEGIN NOW  A small crowd has gathered around in waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW When did they get here? Who invited so many people to your party? The man that funded your exodus is here too.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s on the list.  END
BEGIN NOW But the children.  END
BEGIN NOW Why the hell are there so many kids going to San Jose on a Saturday morning?  They’re all wearing black shirts with the same design on them.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be a youth group or some kind of school thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Nonviolent gang members, maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Point is, they are going to take up a lot of space and prattle and rattle on like school children do.  END
BEGIN NOW The calm peace of the morning will dissipate into madness of mindless chatter. END
BEGIN NOW You have to make sure you get a seat.  END
BEGIN NOW Sitting down on this bus is going to be vital.  END
BEGIN NOW You adjust your place so you can easily work towards the front of the crowd when the door opens.  END
BEGIN NOW  You might be able to slip in just after all the old people.  END
BEGIN NOW If your timing is right and your foot work is agile.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be seated in no time.  END
BEGIN NOW You might even be able to doze off to the white noise of so much blah blah blah. END
BEGIN NOW The first people on all have weary faces.  END
BEGIN NOW They will sit up front and say nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s perfectly acceptable.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t feel like talking at this hour.  END
BEGIN NOW If you tried to talk right now it would be a disaster.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re tired enough to ramble to complete strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW This is why you take a book when you travel.  END
BEGIN NOW So you don’t just stare at people on a full bus when you can’t look out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW Your seat will be in the front.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the seats that faces more seats on the opposite side.  END
BEGIN NOW You will not be able to look ahead.  END
BEGIN NOW A girl will sit directly across from you.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t panic.  END
BEGIN NOW She just wanted a seat and took the first one she saw.  END
BEGIN NOW And no, she doesn’t keep looking at you.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re imagining things.  END
BEGIN NOW Read your book.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is going to be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Just keep your goddamn head down and read.  END
BEGIN NOW But you check once more and catch her in the act.  END
BEGIN NOW She will think she’s catching you.  END
BEGIN NOW But you know better.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just trying to read your book. END
BEGIN NOW The bus will roll along and bump and lurch down the freeway.  END
BEGIN NOW The standing children will sway back and forth bending to the will of inertia.  END
BEGIN NOW  The ebb and flow of traffic goes by behind you.  END
BEGIN NOW After a while the bus will stop and all the children will eject themselves onto the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus breathes a sigh of relief.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone readjusts.  END
BEGIN NOW Shifts in their seats to maximum comfort.  END
BEGIN NOW Just keep reading.  END
BEGIN NOW Relax a little, but keep to your book.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter that you’ve been re-reading the same paragraph for ten minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW You could really use a nap about now.  END
BEGIN NOW Sleep sounds like the best of all possible options to occupy your time.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus hits a bump, jarring you and keeping you conscious.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh well.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you can just rest your eyes for a while. END
BEGIN NOW Diridon station will stand as stations do.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun will start to feel hot now.  END
BEGIN NOW When you get off the bus the coat will not seem as necessary as it did earlier.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a drinking fountain in the station.  END
BEGIN NOW Have a mint and drink some water.  END
BEGIN NOW You have one more bus to catch and it won’t be here for while.  END
BEGIN NOW You have time to spare.  END
BEGIN NOW You could throw the hat down again.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe make a few extra bucks.  END
BEGIN NOW A little something for a cup of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead you get out the laptop and do some writing.  END
BEGIN NOW The time will go by quickly if your write.  END
BEGIN NOW Forty more minutes of waiting will not go to waste if you can create something.  END
BEGIN NOW  This is how you started writing this morning down.  END
BEGIN NOW The seventeen express will arrive on time.  END
BEGIN NOW You will put everything away and get out the bag of change.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be left with twenty seven cents.  END
BEGIN NOW That will be of no use to you.  END
BEGIN NOW There is  othing you can buy anywhere for twenty seven cents anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW  You climb aboard and put your life savings into coin slot for a bus.  END
BEGIN NOW This one is not so crowded.  END
BEGIN NOW You take a seat at the back by the window.  END
BEGIN NOW Remove your coat and long sleeve shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW Good thing that duffel bag is mostly empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Lean your head on something and close your eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW The extent of your exhaustion is becoming readily apparent.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside the morning has turned into a day.  END
BEGIN NOW Those with weekend jobs commute in their cars along the many lanes of highways.  END
BEGIN NOW Trucks make their deliveries.  END
BEGIN NOW Beach bound surfers drive hatchbacks and old Volvos over the mountain everyone calls a hill.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus takes a break from all this concrete and urban atmosphere.  END
BEGIN NOW The trees become thicker with every turn.  END
BEGIN NOW When you reach the summit you have a few seconds to glance at the green valley below.  END
BEGIN NOW  Every leaf bathed in light.  END
BEGIN NOW Every urge in you trying to get some rest.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not much time.  END
BEGIN NOW You think, maybe when you get off the bus, find a quiet place and lay down for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s just not going to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW So much to do and so little time.  END
BEGIN NOW You rest your eyes when you can. END
BEGIN NOW The bus will take to an incline, tilting ever so slightly into Scotts Valley.  END
BEGIN NOW The people around you will make small talk.  END
BEGIN NOW It will all sound like mumbles and jabbering.  END
BEGIN NOW The three girls that look like they’re on the way home from a party.  END
BEGIN NOW The business man that claims to be a dance choreographer, making conversation when he can.  END
BEGIN NOW The travelers all making their way into Santa Cruz for the weekend.  END
BEGIN NOW Scotts Valley transit center will be the only punctuation until the full stop at the metro.  END
BEGIN NOW You can try to wake up a little more now.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the bus ride will be brief.  END
BEGIN NOW Gather your things and get ready to exit on Ocean Street. END
BEGIN NOW On the curb by the gas station you get off with a small handful of other people.  END
BEGIN NOW You cut across Water St.  END
BEGIN NOW and walk past the court house.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re lucky, right now your phone will ring.  END
BEGIN NOW The only person that knows you’re in town will call.  END
BEGIN NOW You will pick up the phone and listen and be happy to hear the voice on the other end of the line.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be distracted by that voice until you make it to the back yard of a friend’s apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Here you will sit, talking for as long as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Your friend will mill about the house, looking at you in surprise and asking you for cigarettes you don’t have.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the same thing he asked you last time you saw him.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the same question he will ask you every time you see him all weekend.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead of hello, or hey man, or how’s it going? Instead he will say, smoke? Got a cigarette? END
BEGIN NOW You ask to use the shower to wash away all that traveling.  END
BEGIN NOW Not to mention last night’s work.  END
BEGIN NOW  It’s going to be a long day and now you have all the time in the world to do as you please.  END
BEGIN NOW  Shower quickly and diligently.  END
BEGIN NOW Let the hot water give you a fourth or fifth wind.  END
BEGIN NOW Shave, comb your hair, look respectable.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s time to find some people and figure out how to eat something today.  END
BEGIN NOW  Everything else just happens as it will.  END
BEGIN NOW After priorities, the rest is only details.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re going to be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re going to make it. END
BEGIN NOW He fidgets nervously, trying not to keep his eyes too long in one spot.  END
BEGIN NOW Hands tapping on the knees, smoothing out creases in his pant legs. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m kinda stuck,” she says while pouring hot water through a tea strainer, loose leaves bleeding richer in color at the bottom of a cup. END
BEGIN NOW “Stuck?” he asks, “stuck how?” END
BEGIN NOW “Stuck here, in this place, this city, this job, these debts.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tell me about it.” END
BEGIN NOW “No, seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t get my mind off it for a minute.” END
BEGIN NOW “This too shall pass,” he says in tones of quotable dignity. END
BEGIN NOW “Who said that?” END
BEGIN NOW “You did, about a month ago.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well here’s to my unwavering genius,” She hands him a hot mug. END
BEGIN NOW “Cheers,” END
BEGIN NOW They blow over the surface making waves. END
BEGIN NOW “Is this it?” She inquires, not yet drinking. END
BEGIN NOW “Is what it?” After a sip. END
BEGIN NOW “Is this life? In and out of debt, job to shitty job, all too short lapses, tea and smoke breaks.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, what do you want out of life?” Yes, let’s make a list. END
BEGIN NOW “What do I want?” she sits down next to him and rests her head back on the couch, starring at the ceiling with seldom blinking eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck if I know, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Hand me my smokes, in my purse.” END
BEGIN NOW He extracts a pack from her handbag, produces one long white cylinder, and hands it to her filter first. END
BEGIN NOW “Lighter?” She mimes flicking one. END
BEGIN NOW He pulls a book of matches from his pocket, strikes and holds it up, flame touching the end starting the cherry. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks,” she says smiling, exhaling a lazy puff of white smoke. END
BEGIN NOW He sets a small glass pipe on the coffee table and goes to the kitchen for a spice jar and a lighter.  END
BEGIN NOW He unscrews the lid, breaks up a bud on the cover of The Paris Review and packs a bowl. END
BEGIN NOW “Tea and more tea, how thoughtful you are,” She says with wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Balance my dear.  END
BEGIN NOW Life is all balance.” END
BEGIN NOW “Balance between what? The madness of survival, of going nowhere and routine, between struggle and suffering?” END
BEGIN NOW “Hardly.” He sparks the green on one side, leaving a courtesy patch for the girl.  END
BEGIN NOW He holds it in a few seconds and coughs a little, sending smoke signals. END
BEGIN NOW “The balance between good and hard times.  END
BEGIN NOW Between lonely nights and social days.  END
BEGIN NOW Bitter tea and honey sweetened with a touch of milk.  END
BEGIN NOW Sobriety here, debauchery there, you know.” END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm.” Agreement to a degree.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes her hit, cigarette between the ring and pinky knuckle.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a sip after exhale and a drag after that. END
BEGIN NOW “I want an adventure,” She declares, breaking the smoky silence. END
BEGIN NOW “An adventure? You want to stumble on a map and look for long lost treasures, sail the high seas?” END
BEGIN NOW “Absurd, you and your sensible realism.” She hands the pipe back. END
BEGIN NOW “No, nothing so past romantic, but I do want to travel.  END
BEGIN NOW Get the hell out of the States at least.  END
BEGIN NOW See the world, run into some fantastic people with foreign accents, wander Paris streets at dusk, have tea in London, smoke weed in Amsterdam, you know.” END
BEGIN NOW “Drink deep from the well of life and all that.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, and all that.” END
BEGIN NOW He pulls a long harsh throat searing hit and coughs hard. END
BEGIN NOW “Easy there,” She flicks the ash from her cigarette into a cold, stone ashtray. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s so frustrating right? At our age.” He says finally after a long slug of tea. END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm,” she agrees again.  END
BEGIN NOW “Getting out and getting started.  END
BEGIN NOW Always so broke.  END
BEGIN NOW God, I hate this.” She pushes smoke out hard between pursed lips, grimacing. END
BEGIN NOW “There’s always plan b.” He grins. END
BEGIN NOW “And what’s that? Win the lottery? There’s a sure bet.” END
BEGIN NOW “No, no.  END
BEGIN NOW Marry a rich doctor, bleed him dry and run away.” END
BEGIN NOW “Always with the realistic suggestions.  END
BEGIN NOW No, fuck that.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not the marrying type, not even for purely selfish reasons.” END
BEGIN NOW “What? I’m sure you could pull that off, if you could bare a little creepy doctor sex.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ugh, never.  END
BEGIN NOW I could see him now, inserting his dick with surgical precision, leaving on his socks and stethoscope.” She laughs a little, shakes her head and takes the pipe extended in her direction.  END
BEGIN NOW She sparks it and pulls deep to her diaphragm.  END
BEGIN NOW Coughing a little after holding it. END
BEGIN NOW “So you didn’t grow up collecting cut outs from bridal magazines, meticulously planning your wedding day?” END
BEGIN NOW “How vulgar.  END
BEGIN NOW Never.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m no sacrifice to the great god routine.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not breeding material, not a mother by any means.  END
BEGIN NOW Couldn’t stand it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m so over the whole idea.” END
BEGIN NOW “How about you?” she asks. END
BEGIN NOW “How about me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Marriage, kids, white picket fences, a nine to five and meatloaf once a week?” END
BEGIN NOW “A model 1950’s atomic cold war family.” He digs around in his pockets for cigarettes and comes up empty. END
BEGIN NOW “Be a doll and lend me one?” END
BEGIN NOW “Promise to return the favor?” she asks. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t make promises.  END
BEGIN NOW Ruins my reputation.  END
BEGIN NOW But to answer your question, no.  END
BEGIN NOW I fall in love too often.  END
BEGIN NOW Too fickle.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d make a terrible husband and a flakey father.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to able change scenes at a moment’s notice.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not that I fear commitment, it’s just not for me.” END
BEGIN NOW And you’ve been here how long?” END
BEGIN NOW “20 years.” END
BEGIN NOW “Swell job you’re doing on this crazy life plan.” END
BEGIN NOW “Give it time, I’m still young.” He lights up, blowing two successful smoke rings and a few failures. END
BEGIN NOW “Never could do that.” END
BEGIN NOW “It’s all in the lips.” He winks. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, what do you want out of life?” END
BEGIN NOW “Me? A few funny stories, a few close friends.  END
BEGIN NOW A witty inscription on my tombstone.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot of good laughs.” END
BEGIN NOW “How’s that coming along?” END
BEGIN NOW “So far, pretty damn well.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe someday I’ll turn the whole mess into a book.” END
BEGIN NOW “Do it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d love to read it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Then I could honestly say that my life is an open book.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a neglected work of genius on the dusty shelves of the used book stores of America.” END
BEGIN NOW “In the laps of a million hipsters, coffee stained and ashed on pages.  END
BEGIN NOW You, the antihero of a generation.” She laughs at this. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, it could happen. END
BEGIN NOW “Hopeless romantic, you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Muse and inspiration, you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Serious?” END
BEGIN NOW “Deathly so.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re sweet,” she says. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks, I try.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone needs to compliment your overbearing bitter pessimism.  END
BEGIN NOW “ END
BEGIN NOW “Pfft, fuck you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Should you be so lucky.” END
BEGIN NOW “God! You’re terrible.” END
BEGIN NOW “Everyone needs a hobby.” They sit a minute. END
BEGIN NOW “How’s that bowl doing?” She inquires. END
BEGIN NOW “Ass.  END
BEGIN NOW Ashes.  END
BEGIN NOW Gone and forgotten.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tragic.  END
BEGIN NOW I won’t forget you little bowl.  END
BEGIN NOW And your precious cargo.” END
BEGIN NOW She salutes the ashtray and he smirks at her. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re terribly silly.” He observes. END
BEGIN NOW “Defensive reflex, purely.  END
BEGIN NOW A serious life is not one worth living.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriousness is reserved for taxes and funerals.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s a good way of looking at it.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s balance.” END
BEGIN NOW “I balance on the tight rope of life, precariously cautions of the safety net below, tip toeing towards the infinite abyss of the other side.” She radiates. END
BEGIN NOW “What’s that from?” END
BEGIN NOW “My very stoned, warped little mind.” She takes in the last of her tea. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m drained, how’re you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Running on empty.” END
BEGIN NOW “Another cup?” END
BEGIN NOW “Wanna go for a walk? Lovely night for it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Got a coat you can lend me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Should be a few in the closet.  END
BEGIN NOW I should pick up a pack too.” END
BEGIN NOW “Then we’re on a mission.” END
BEGIN NOW “A mission for cigarettes?” END
BEGIN NOW “Start small.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we’ll get swept up into something crazy.” END
BEGIN NOW “Locals start world conquest at corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW More at eleven.” END
BEGIN NOW “There’s always hope.” END
BEGIN NOW “Even for the likes of us?” END
BEGIN NOW “Especially.” END
BEGIN NOW She waits at the landing while he locks the door; lights another cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW “Lighter thief!” he declares. END
BEGIN NOW “Forethought.” She corrects him. END
BEGIN NOW “Bum a drag?” END
BEGIN NOW “Want a whole one?” END
BEGIN NOW “I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW How habitual of me.” And after lighting, “thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW They stand a minute, still stoned, red dry eyed.  END
BEGIN NOW Puffing slow drags into the night air.  END
BEGIN NOW A chill breeze blows it all away, wispy and fading into the moonlit clouds.  END
BEGIN NOW They descend, lady first, down the steps and on to the sidewalk. END
BEGIN NOW It’s three city blocks to the corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s four dollars and fifty-eight cents for a pack of cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW He taps the cellophane wrapped box on the inside of his wrist, three times hard and fast.  END
BEGIN NOW Peels off the plastic and hands her two. END
BEGIN NOW “A perfect gentleman.” She smiles thanks instead of intoning it. END
BEGIN NOW “Always, without regret.” Then, after lighting a fresh one, “but it never gets me laid.” END
BEGIN NOW “A pity, really.  END
BEGIN NOW No sex appeal for gentlemen,” END
BEGIN NOW “So it is.  END
BEGIN NOW futile exercises in human sexuality.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m no alpha male, and I despise meat-headed cavemen.” END
BEGIN NOW “Also a pity.  END
BEGIN NOW Every girl likes her hair pulled.” She adds, “of course there’s a time and place.” END
BEGIN NOW “In the backseats and bedrooms of the world…” END
BEGIN NOW “In the restrooms and counter tops, the couches and beach blankets…” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t forget hot tubs.” END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm, hot tub sex.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a while.” END
BEGIN NOW “Do spare me.” END
BEGIN NOW “You don’t want details for once?” END
BEGIN NOW “You’ve expounded on your sexual exploits to me on numerous occasions.  END
BEGIN NOW I really don’t need any reminders that you’re way more experienced than me.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sorry, I didn’t mean…” END
BEGIN NOW “You never do.  END
BEGIN NOW But still…” he sighs. END
BEGIN NOW “Where should we go? Objective completed and all.” END
BEGIN NOW “Through the park? Mayhaps around the block?” END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s wander and end up at the river.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s a good plan.” END
BEGIN NOW “Not a plan, don’t make plans.  END
BEGIN NOW Plans get broken.” END
BEGIN NOW “Then what is it?” he asks. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s a goal, a new objective, to be reached by any means necessary.” END
BEGIN NOW He digests this for a minute, smoking between the index and middle fingers. END
BEGIN NOW “Plans are too specific,” she adds, “much too much for me.” END
BEGIN NOW “What are your other goals?” END
BEGIN NOW “My other goals…Hmm short or long term?” END
BEGIN NOW “Short then long.” END
BEGIN NOW “Short term, this week, find a new job that I can stand.  END
BEGIN NOW Pay the electric, do some laundry and call my mom.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fairly standard to do list.  END
BEGIN NOW What about long term?” END
BEGIN NOW They walk at a slow matched pace and she mulls over the answer. END
BEGIN NOW “Get the hell out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Leave some kind of mark on the world.” END
BEGIN NOW “I scrawl my mark on the stalls of the world in black marker, for a good time call…” END
BEGIN NOW “Very funny.” END
BEGIN NOW “I try.” He runs his fingers over the gaps of a chain link fence, sending vibrations everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s rest a minute on this convenient bus bench.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.” END
BEGIN NOW She sits down, her legs flopping exaggeratedly in the air, over doing the momentum. END
BEGIN NOW “What did you dream about doing when you were a kid?” She asks him resting her head on his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m still a kid.” He says, avoiding the question. END
BEGIN NOW “Hardly and regardless.” Flatly demanding a real answer. END
BEGIN NOW “If you must know, I wanted to be an astronaut or a scientist.” END
BEGIN NOW “Really?” Somewhat incredulous. END
BEGIN NOW “Swear to Christ.” He says. END
BEGIN NOW “I thought you didn’t believe in Christ?” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus is less of a person and more of a punctuation mark to me.  END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes he’s an idea.” END
BEGIN NOW “An idea of what?” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus is, for the most part an idea of how people can get along despite everything.” END
BEGIN NOW “Despite his Jewishness, the roman occupation, being killed for disturbing the peace.” END
BEGIN NOW “He was a troublemaker, yeah.” END
BEGIN NOW “Funny how in Sunday school they drill obedience in your head.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus was a hell raiser.” END
BEGIN NOW “I thought you never went to Sunday school.” END
BEGIN NOW “Once or twice.  END
BEGIN NOW Too young to remember much.” She states reflectively. END
BEGIN NOW “I like to think of rebellion as the most basic of human tendencies.” She adds. END
BEGIN NOW “I think so too.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever do shit purely for the sake of disobedience?” END
BEGIN NOW “All the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes to my own detriment.” END
BEGIN NOW “Same.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so many regrets though.” END
BEGIN NOW “Not a fan of regrets.  END
BEGIN NOW Live and learn I guess.” END
BEGIN NOW “I guess so.” Pause. END
BEGIN NOW “C’mon,” he says “Let’s go to the river.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoke another bowl.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fantastic.” She takes out a water bottle hidden within her coat. END
BEGIN NOW “Where the hell did that come from?” END
BEGIN NOW “Pinched it while you were getting smokes.” She smiles. END
BEGIN NOW “Wanna sip?” She asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Please and thank you.” He tilts the plastic bottle, taking a few good swallows; curing long overdue cotton mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW He hands the bottle back, wiping his chin.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ahh,” he exhales, “thanks again.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re welcome.” She says, screwing the cap back on.  END
BEGIN NOW They stand up and walk along the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW She pretends a seam in the concrete is a balancing beam; walking foot in front of foot, arms out stretched. END
BEGIN NOW “Balance,” she states, “is all about footwork.” END
BEGIN NOW “What if you’re a cripple?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, then you’re fucked.” She shrugs and jumps off the imaginary beam. END
BEGIN NOW “I give you a nine point two.” He says holding up nothing. END
BEGIN NOW “Tough critic.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought you said I was perfect.” END
BEGIN NOW “You are perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW For me.  END
BEGIN NOW But you’re not flawless.” END
BEGIN NOW “I told you I’m a little fucked up.” END
BEGIN NOW He looks at her in disbelief. END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, really fucked up.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re not so bad.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks,” she says, looking at nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW He bounces a little from foot to foot, avoiding debris and foliage, hands in his pockets. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.” He adds after a while. END
BEGIN NOW He takes her hand and walks along her side.  END
BEGIN NOW They take a foot path off the sidewalk, down towards the river. END
BEGIN NOW “Lovely moon for a smoke,” he says, glancing upward. END
BEGIN NOW “Isn’t it?” END
BEGIN NOW There’s a curb in the suburbs.  END
BEGIN NOW Concrete seams at predictable intervals and clusters at mail boxes marking small groups of tract houses.  END
BEGIN NOW Being midday, the sun makes a dial from the pole of a streetlamp.  END
BEGIN NOW Setting the time around just after two in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW A boy of twelve or so eats an apple, ass on the curb, legs crossed at the ankles in the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Taking small, messy bites from a Granny Smith.  END
BEGIN NOW His face gets sticky from the stubborn juices.  END
BEGIN NOW He wipes his hands and chin on the knees of his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW He waits for the mail man.  END
BEGIN NOW The expectation of delivery getting lost with every every destructive jaw motion.  END
BEGIN NOW Mangling the apple flesh.  END
BEGIN NOW Turning a previously gold-green fruit into mushy digestible chunks and eventually, into completely unrecognizable nutrient-less masses of shit. END
BEGIN NOW The apple was purchased at a chain supermarket.  END
BEGIN NOW  Chosen from a meticulously stacked array of similarly polished, at first glance flawless, Granny Smith apples.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy that stacked and polished the apples is still fist deep in public high school, where he’s simultaneously failing physical education, algebra, and chemistry while acing physics and political science.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a penchant for smoking high grade imported hash and polishing fruit.  END
BEGIN NOW He rubs his hands on his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW Hash distracted by a torn patch on his knee.  END
BEGIN NOW Fingers in the fray, toying with the fabric scars left by bike rides in ill lit parking lots.  END
BEGIN NOW He steps out to the alley, extracts a pack of domestic, filtered cigarettes, sits on a dairy crate, lights inhaling and relaxes.  END
BEGIN NOW He musters up mucus and coughs a green-yellow gob, spitting it into a drain grate. END
BEGIN NOW He looks up out beyond the rooftops, to the trees the branches the leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW The breeze blown swaying top story section where a blue jay on look out perches.  END
BEGIN NOW The bird is mildly upset.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s looking for a mate but the scene is dead.  END
BEGIN NOW The lady jays all spent, already egg laying, already reclining post coitus in the nests of so many similar trees.  END
BEGIN NOW The jay had a shot with a pretty little thing with perfect tail feathers.  END
BEGIN NOW She was distracted by brighter plumage and a bigger beak.  END
BEGIN NOW He hovers his ass over the leaves and shits, watching it fall into the passenger seat of a convertible, traffic stuck in a bit of two lane highway.  END
BEGIN NOW  The genus of the tree is of no importance.  END
BEGIN NOW It provides shade in the summer and stark, stoic simplicity during the fall and winter months.  END
BEGIN NOW The fallen leaves are blown into piles into which no children will jump.  END
BEGIN NOW The leaf blower is operated by a scruffy foreigner with big, red eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He was up for the last two days on a coke binge.  END
BEGIN NOW Now half sedated but still jittery; calming his nerves with cheap beer and decent marijuana. END
BEGIN NOW “Eww! Gross! Omigawd!” A girl’s face rises from the driver’s seat, returning upright on the passenger side.  END
BEGIN NOW “Something just shit on my back!” She squirms. END
BEGIN NOW “There’s some napkins in the glove.” END
BEGIN NOW “Eww! Ugh!” She looks sickly.  END
BEGIN NOW “Get it off me!” END
BEGIN NOW The driver puts his erection away, sighs and takes one of the napkins.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the shit has run down the small of her back, making a white-yellow streak heading towards the crack of her ass; desperate attempts to return to the source.  END
BEGIN NOW These napkins were meant for other fluids.  END
BEGIN NOW The driver’s disappointment manifesting in his aching groin.  END
BEGIN NOW Blue balled again.  END
BEGIN NOW Stymied by stray shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Just his luck, I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls his eyes and sighs, growing impatient.  END
BEGIN NOW Traffic takes longer to move, time crawls.  END
BEGIN NOW The passenger looks more disgusted, having thrown up a little in the back of her throat.  END
BEGIN NOW Reliving the after taste of bile mixed with gin and tonic.  END
BEGIN NOW She puffs her cheeks and exhales slowly. END
BEGIN NOW “Sam,” she mumbles.  END
BEGIN NOW “Pull over.” END
BEGIN NOW “We’re stuck baby, just relax.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m fucking serious, Sam.  END
BEGIN NOW Pull the goddamn car over.  END
BEGIN NOW  I’m sick.” END
BEGIN NOW “Just lean over the window and let it go, you’ll feel better.” END
BEGIN NOW Sam’s balls refuse to relinquish any sort of sympathy.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam is sick of half-assed foreplay that leads nowhere.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not really foreplay.  END
BEGIN NOW Foreplay requires after-play.  END
BEGIN NOW Typically intercourse.  END
BEGIN NOW Tension build up to sweet release.  END
BEGIN NOW Tease and please and god, just fuck me.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s sick of being blue balled.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s sick of her playing it off like it’s no big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW That his needs are of no real importance.  END
BEGIN NOW That interrupted road head leads straight to road rage, traffic accidents, parking tickets.  END
BEGIN NOW Malcontented rash decision making.  END
BEGIN NOW That everyone is better off post orgasm.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean fuck, it’s only human.  END
BEGIN NOW The cars move forward, bumper to bumper; motorized molasses.  END
BEGIN NOW The reason for such slow movement comes into view.  END
BEGIN NOW A road side attraction, tall blond with a Sunday hat, three cars stopped to help, debating who gets to wield the tire iron.  END
BEGIN NOW The passenger leans over the window and vomits a steady stream on to the pavement.  END
BEGIN NOW She groans, wiping the run-off from her chin.  END
BEGIN NOW “Christ!” She coughs out another pint of stomach acid and water. END
BEGIN NOW “Feel better?” END
BEGIN NOW “I can’t taste your cock anymore.” END
BEGIN NOW “Congratulations,”  he says through apathetic lips.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything is better than fermented genital sweat. END
BEGIN NOW “I need to go back to the room, Sam.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m working on it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sam, I really need to go back to the room.” END
BEGIN NOW “I know, you just told me.” END
BEGIN NOW “I feel sick.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’ve demonstrated as much.” END
BEGIN NOW “I need a shower and a nap and a tooth brush.” END
BEGIN NOW “For fuck’s sake Dee, shut the hell up.” END
BEGIN NOW Note to self; directionless erections lead to a distinct lack of any sort of empathy. END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t tell me to shut up.” END
BEGIN NOW “If you were a woman, I’d slap you.  END
BEGIN NOW Shut up.” END
BEGIN NOW “If I were a woman! If I were a woman! I’m more of a woman then you’ll ever be!” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh Jesus, you’re just another girl in Jackie O sunglasses playing dress up and listening to Aretha Franklin records for validation.” END
BEGIN NOW Dee closes her eyes and puts her hands over her ears.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face falls into her lap and she starts screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW The driver’s side door opens and closes.  END
BEGIN NOW The car is off, the keys are gone and Dee is screaming. END
BEGIN NOW Sam walks down two blocks of sidewalk, puffing on a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s breathing through it.  END
BEGIN NOW The cherry takes up half the length.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands are shaking.  END
BEGIN NOW He spies a bar across the street with an unimportant name.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar bares burn scars.  END
BEGIN NOW A historical record of badly aimed cigarette butts.  END
BEGIN NOW Beer buzz eluding attempts to stab at ash trays.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam sits at the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender takes his order without saying a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW A glass of mostly bottom shelf bourbon holds a few ice cubes; cracking and melting.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam stares at the glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Beads of moisture build up on the exterior. END
BEGIN NOW The glass is half empty now.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam looks out of the dust and grim fogged window at the barber shop across the street.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wanted to get a haircut for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW An empty glass sits neglected next to a five dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam is sitting in the chair at the barber shop.  END
BEGIN NOW He asks for a trim and tries to relax.  END
BEGIN NOW The electric razor buzzes to life and Sam sits in the chair, eyes closed.  END
BEGIN NOW He feels the hair fall from his head.  END
BEGIN NOW The careful skilled hands of the barber work with quick precision.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam’s hair falls on the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes are closed.  END
BEGIN NOW The vibrations of the razor dominate his senses.  END
BEGIN NOW He opens his eyes and the razor shuts off.  END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror he looks like a new recruit.  END
BEGIN NOW  He blinks a few times in apathy.  END
BEGIN NOW The barber folds a ten dollar bill into his pocket and gets the broom.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam walks the two blocks back to his car, still parked in the middle of the street.  END
BEGIN NOW He gets in, starts the engine and lets the breeze blow the ticket out from under the wipers.  END
BEGIN NOW He lights another cigarette and drives back to the motel.  END
BEGIN NOW Dee is asleep in the bed.  END
BEGIN NOW He closes the bathroom door and undresses.  END
BEGIN NOW He crawls into bed trying not to wake the woman.  END
BEGIN NOW In the morning, the motel blinds filter dawn light, sending stripes across the bed.  END
BEGIN NOW A bobbing bump under the sheets stirs Sam to consciousness. END
BEGIN NOW “What? Huh?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh darling,” she muffles under covers.  END
BEGIN NOW Sam groans a little more awake. END
BEGIN NOW “Darling,” she emerges, “Something’s wrong.” END
BEGIN NOW “What could possibly be wrong?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ve been blowing you for twenty minutes and it hasn’t done a damn thing.” END
BEGIN NOW Sam has gone soft.  END
BEGIN NOW  He stares at the ceiling with empty eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Outside in the early afternoon light there is a tree, basking in and blocking the sunbeams, waves and particles of light, speeding into the leaves of a grand, tall tree.  END
BEGIN NOW Blocking the light from the motel.  END
BEGIN NOW Shielding the motel windows from cancer.  END
BEGIN NOW In the branches there’s a blue jay squawking into the air.  END
BEGIN NOW He rustles the leaves, rustles his feathers and makes some noise.  END
BEGIN NOW He can be loud.  END
BEGIN NOW He can garner attention.  END
BEGIN NOW He leans out of the tree and shits.  END
BEGIN NOW Letting it fall out of him. END
BEGIN NOW The painting hung on a wall where I suppose most paintings belong.  END
BEGIN NOW The painter died long before I did.  END
BEGIN NOW He was one of those Impressionists.  END
BEGIN NOW Could have been Monet or Manet or Manny Fitzpatrick.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, he painted a couple on a beach.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe some French beach before they were all covered with divine jacks after FDR and Jesus played hopscotch on Hitler's ambition. END
BEGIN NOW When I was fifteen the painting wasn't an original--just a reprint on cheap poster board.  END
BEGIN NOW The wall it lived against belonged to my god brother’s family and a dozen or so us would meet up for educational and social purposes.  END
BEGIN NOW I spent a great deal of time with that painting.  END
BEGIN NOW My ears would linger in the room with everyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW But my eyes were on some possibly French beach.  END
BEGIN NOW I got the impression it was French.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really know if that true. END
BEGIN NOW The Couple in that painting stood on the beach in a dress and a suit that wasn't so good for bathing.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it was around winter and the Atlantic was much too cold for an enjoyable swim.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember at fifteen it was the autumn of my youth.  END
BEGIN NOW Right before winter when I had two jobs and was writing letters to a girl in Connecticut whom I met at funeral. END
BEGIN NOW The Painting and I were getting along very well.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I felt very mature--admiring art work that was popular enough to be sold on cheap poster board. END
BEGIN NOW Until once in winter on a long day the painting was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW I asked the young man who taught me about English if he'd seen it.  END
BEGIN NOW He said he took it down.  END
BEGIN NOW I expressed my dismay.  END
BEGIN NOW I really liked that painting. END
BEGIN NOW I know, he said.  END
BEGIN NOW He shuffled some papers around. END
BEGIN NOW “I just don’t know, Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood, Julie has never been problematic in the classroom.  END
BEGIN NOW In fact she’s been quite the model little lady.  END
BEGIN NOW Her finger paintings are just inspirational.  END
BEGIN NOW And her attitude has never strayed from very attentive and curious—like any five year old should be.” Principal Krol looked over the file in front of her and adjusted her glasses.  END
BEGIN NOW She pushed her glasses up her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW She used her middle finger.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood wore a look of mild concern.  END
BEGIN NOW She had walked into the principal’s office that afternoon wearing the same look.  END
BEGIN NOW She wore it the same way a widow wears black years after the fact of the funeral.  END
BEGIN NOW “That may be true here, but at home I’ve heard just the foulest nonsense emanating from her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW Words I just can’t even repeat and strung together in a way that lacks both rhyme and reason.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you think that maybe one of the other kids has been teaching bad words to my Julie?” Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood’s concern put on a black Sunday hat and matching veil.  END
BEGIN NOW Principal Krol taps her sausage fingers on a large oak desk.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the row of filing cabinets along the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW On the wall there hung numerous awards the school had received from the state board of education, various parent groups, a framed photograph of the president.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple of plaques.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs and turns her face down at her desk.  END
BEGIN NOW “You see, that’s just the problem one has with trying to educate children nowadays.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like we can’t get to all of them before the television and the movies and that terrible internet.  END
BEGIN NOW  The stuff some of them bring to class can be just mortifying—” END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood’s concern watched as dirt filled a grave buried in her memory. END
BEGIN NOW “—I don’t mean to alarm you, Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood.  END
BEGIN NOW I just feel as though you ought to know the realities of the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW It is quite possible that some other child learned a few new words from some movie or those awful videogames.  END
BEGIN NOW Or even more common, their older siblings will bring words home that the children will imitate.  END
BEGIN NOW You know how younger children like to imitate their elders.” Principal Krol shuffled her feet under her desk and looked over at the plastic potted plant in the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW The plant looked like it needed watering.  END
BEGIN NOW In the next room soft piano music permeated the walls.  END
BEGIN NOW The tune was meandering around the scale like a drunken horse weaving down a cobblestone hill.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood’s concern looked at Principal Krol with absolute bewilderment. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood, that would be Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave.” She paused to confirm that Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood had never heard of her.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave is our new music teacher.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s just wonderful with the children.  END
BEGIN NOW The state sent her over to fill our legal requirement to employ a disabled person.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite her disability, she manages quite well.  END
BEGIN NOW And the children simply adore her.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been with us for some ten—“ END
BEGIN NOW “SSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHITPISS.” A young woman’s voice sang at the piano as if the piano was being chastised. END
BEGIN NOW “—days…” Principal Krol felt Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood’s concern’s eyes widen.  END
BEGIN NOW “What on earth was that noise?” Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood gripped her chair and swiveled her head around for signs of danger. END
BEGIN NOW “Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave’s music is very modern.  END
BEGIN NOW We understand that some parents would be rather concerned—naturally, of course—concerned that teaching music such as what you are hearing now is not of much good for the development of musical theory.  END
BEGIN NOW However, Dr.  END
BEGIN NOW Harris,” Principal Krol paused and nodded at Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood, “the state Psychologist, says that a new study shows that children exposed to music in this way develop strong senses of hearing.  END
BEGIN NOW Dr.  END
BEGIN NOW Harris says—“ END
BEGIN NOW “HORSSSSSSSSSECOCKBALLS.” Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave’s melody was completely indecipherable.  END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave played the piano with sock puppets dressed as politicians that didn’t speak the same language engaging in a debate about the reality of class structure and the government’s involvement or lack thereof. END
BEGIN NOW “—Dr.  END
BEGIN NOW Harris says that early development should focus more on letting the children discover the notes on their own.” Principal Krol looked pleased with her herself.  END
BEGIN NOW If she had a mirror, Principal Krol would look at herself looking pleased at Principal Krol. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood had to gather her thoughts for a moment.  END
BEGIN NOW “FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUCKY.  END
BEGIN NOW CUNT.  END
BEGIN NOW CUNT, CUNT.” Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave delivered the last line of the song more like spoken word poetry. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood choked on nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW It was probably the air.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet she choked on the air.  END
BEGIN NOW “You said Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave is disabled?” She coughed a few more times to sure that the air was out of her throat. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood, that’s correct.  END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave is a disabled American.  END
BEGIN NOW I can assure you that she’s a fully qualified and credentialed teacher.  END
BEGIN NOW I have the paperwork right here if it would be of interest to you.” Principal Krol reached for a stack of papers at one end of the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW The end closer to the thirstiest plant ever.  END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t need to see the paperwork, thank you.  END
BEGIN NOW But Principal Krol, what exactly—if you don’t mind my asking—is Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave’s disability?”  END
BEGIN NOW Principal Krol pushed her glasses up her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh.  END
BEGIN NOW Why, Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Pengrave has Tourette’s syndrome.  END
BEGIN NOW A most dreadful illness from what I’m told.  END
BEGIN NOW Just imagine—all those tics.” She sighed and shook her head. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Hargood shuffled in her seat, unsure of how to respond to such a situation. END
BEGIN NOW The piano music carried on like a lost donkey trying to go for a late afternoon swim.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a knock at the door. END
BEGIN NOW “If you’ll excuse me,” said Principal Krol, “Come in!” END
BEGIN NOW Standing in the doorway was a small child.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be four, could be five. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes Melissa, what is it?” END
BEGIN NOW “Dickballs!” Melissa smiles. END
BEGIN NOW The two women exchanged looks.  END
BEGIN NOW It nice trade of facial expressions. END
BEGIN NOW “Okay!” the little girl says.  END
BEGIN NOW “bye bye!” END
BEGIN NOW I drank gin because my father drank gin.  END
BEGIN NOW My father drank gin because his father did.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all my grandfather left me; the herbal alcoholic sharp stench of gin.  END
BEGIN NOW It lingered in the kitchen by the table, by his overcoat and night stand, in the empty glass next to the small framed photograph of my grandmother in a Sunday dress.  END
BEGIN NOW The best black and whites money could buy.  END
BEGIN NOW And now on my breath, off the ice in the glass on the bar top, from the bottles of Beefeater and Bombay.  END
BEGIN NOW The glass is empty now and the bartender raises an eyebrow in inquiry.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps another round? O solo mio? I think not, I’ve had enough, I’m good, just the tab please.  END
BEGIN NOW I pay and tip, push the door open and hit the street, hit the concrete with my feet and walk.  END
BEGIN NOW Gin was on my father’s breath, it came off in his pours, in his sweat.  END
BEGIN NOW He breathed it on me when he said goodnight, it came off in his tears when my grandfather died.  END
BEGIN NOW I can see it now in the vapor when I exhale into the night air.  END
BEGIN NOW Feel it mix with the blood in my veins.  END
BEGIN NOW Thin and pumping through my legs. END
BEGIN NOW Counting the cracks in the concrete, one foot in front of the other, we’ve done this before.  END
BEGIN NOW Step on a crack and break your mother’s back.  END
BEGIN NOW But my mother was a whore.  END
BEGIN NOW She blew the gas station attendant for a full tank.  END
BEGIN NOW She blew the salesman for that set of encyclopedias she never read.  END
BEGIN NOW She said they looked pretty on the shelves.  END
BEGIN NOW Right next to the self help books she never read.  END
BEGIN NOW The Harvard Classics with still crisp pages.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother was more of a seven o’clock news girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She drank rum.  END
BEGIN NOW rum with cola, with coffee and milk, with ice.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d drink with the news.  END
BEGIN NOW Toast the newsman when he came on.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d dress up in a skirt and a smart blouse, a fresh coat of makeup.  END
BEGIN NOW By the time the cast wound down to the human interest piece she was slouched.  END
BEGIN NOW Blouse down to precious few buttons, lip stick stained glass window licker.  END
BEGIN NOW Dear ol’ Mom.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor ol’ Dad.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he had gin.  END
BEGIN NOW Reliable and trustworthy gin.  END
BEGIN NOW Gin that would always listen; gin that never let him down.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW I steadied the brick and mortar building next to me, somehow holding them both up with one hand.  END
BEGIN NOW My knees buckle and I think maybe it’s me.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe all that damn gin was starting to take hold.  END
BEGIN NOW I curse the English loudly.  END
BEGIN NOW I curse Mom and Dad, the bartender, the bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW The sidewalk is much closer now, each grain of concrete a pain a grain of sand in my eye.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve given up.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m slack jawed, slack assed and half way out.  END
BEGIN NOW And father had the nicest lips. END
BEGIN NOW Things to do in San Francisco When You’re Alone. END
BEGIN NOW Man, all these palm trees.  END
BEGIN NOW I fuckin’ hate palm trees.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Strange city, no direction, out bound not for a few more hours and a pocket full of other people’s dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that they’re stolen, I should clarify that.  END
BEGIN NOW Not one to steal, but I borrow haphazardly.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it comes back on time.  END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes, well you know… sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW I sit on the dock watching crests peak in a harbor off some street I can’t remember.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit leaning, looking out, light a cigarette and look for something to do.  END
BEGIN NOW The salt water sea breeze blows the smoke right back.  END
BEGIN NOW Lighting the damn thing was five kinds of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW I pick up and walk down a street past shops of all sorts.  END
BEGIN NOW Past rows of people hocking bracelets.  END
BEGIN NOW We share that bond.  END
BEGIN NOW The seller and buyer.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever you need, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Just give me twenty minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW I heard of this place five blocks up but it turns out to be nine.  END
BEGIN NOW Best cup of coffee in days; no fucking around.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone is playing a piano on a second story.  END
BEGIN NOW The notes bounce off parallel parked cars and down into my shoes; walking with rhythm.  END
BEGIN NOW A nigger squirrel darts across the street in front, frantic fast rapid fire rodent.  END
BEGIN NOW Urban tree rat.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll get hit by a mattress delivery truck within three days.  END
BEGIN NOW No one will miss the nigger squirrel.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even his nigger squirrel family.  END
BEGIN NOW A human nigger is slouched in the doorway of a rundown theater, his breath is short gasps and he clutches a paper bag with a mostly empty bottle inside.  END
BEGIN NOW He spits in it sometimes and drinks from it other times.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s missing five teeth from the front of his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW His scouring pad hair is thin patchwork, showcasing discolored skin spots.  END
BEGIN NOW He smells like he’s been pissing himself for the last week.  END
BEGIN NOW His fingernails are chewed to the flesh and the dirt and shit and skin have built up underneath.  END
BEGIN NOW  I walk on the other side of the street.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple of queers pass by hand in hand.  END
BEGIN NOW Later hand in ass pocket of all too tight jeans, cut off to reveal bronze smooth thighs.  END
BEGIN NOW Muscles tight and toned.  END
BEGIN NOW Sun bleached straight hair framing designer sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a couple of rich fags.  END
BEGIN NOW Later on they’ll bump coke in the restroom of some swank night club that they complain about.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they’ll suck each other off and rent a boy between them.  END
BEGIN NOW In the morning one will awake facing the wall and feel sick every time he’s kissed.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll start getting irritated and yell.  END
BEGIN NOW The other will not understand and start crying.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they’ll make up and start fucking.  END
BEGIN NOW And while the quiet one sleeps, the other will leave and get drunk. END
BEGIN NOW I find a posh hotel and the ground floor bathroom, but there’s no bathtub, so I guess it’s just a restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit in the stall and roll a joint on top of the weekly paper.  END
BEGIN NOW I smoke with my pants around my ankles, pushing out a shit from all too dry bowels, scratching my balls with the other hand.  END
BEGIN NOW I read the paper and piss.  END
BEGIN NOW The personal ads are boring.  END
BEGIN NOW  The escort ads less so.  END
BEGIN NOW I start touching my cock and get excited.  END
BEGIN NOW A finger along the shaft and the blood starts rushing.  END
BEGIN NOW My scrotum tightens.  END
BEGIN NOW I dry rub my cock looking at an ad for spicy Latin girls.  END
BEGIN NOW Punk rock prostitutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Studded belts and ripped Dead Kennedy’s shirts, fuck me boots, tattoos and pierced clits, lips, rows of earrings and God fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Just fuck, oh fuck me.  END
BEGIN NOW Semen starts soaking through the pages and I fold it, putting it on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW I exit the stall with lazy bloodshot eyes and a mouth full of cotton balls.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a row of sinks lining one of the walls.  END
BEGIN NOW I bend forward and put my mouth to the faucet, drinking greedily.  END
BEGIN NOW  A man in a blue tailored suit is washing his hands next to me.  END
BEGIN NOW His two hundred dollar shoes clack on the crisp marble floor.  END
BEGIN NOW He sees me and looks disgusted; he leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror my face is tired.  END
BEGIN NOW My eyes half closed.  END
BEGIN NOW The sensor perfect temperature water runs over my hands.  END
BEGIN NOW I wash my face and towel dry.  END
BEGIN NOW Feeling much more alive now, awake and clean and empty of unnecessaries.  END
BEGIN NOW The street again and cigarette to lips.  END
BEGIN NOW Lighter to cigarette, smoke in, smoke out and sigh.  END
BEGIN NOW I hunger and everything smells like food.  END
BEGIN NOW Like chink noodle shops and spic taco hole in the wall joints, sea food chowder and some Thai place with an unpronounceable name.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a deli up the street with fist sized stacks of meat between thin slices of sourdough.  END
BEGIN NOW It seems just right until I realize it’s full of kikes.  END
BEGIN NOW Shylock hook-nosed green shit-faced kikes.  END
BEGIN NOW The sandwich is worth about three dollars less than I pay.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a cup of coffee and a bag of over salted chips thrown in.  END
BEGIN NOW Refills are half the price of a fresh cup.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuckin’ kikes.  END
BEGIN NOW I loosen my belt a notch and tighten my shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a bus bench to sit on and smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW I lit up and a fairy with limp wrists and a tank top asks for a spare with flamboyant lisping lips.  END
BEGIN NOW I hand him one and he tries talking to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I tell him to fuck off and take a long drag.  END
BEGIN NOW He floats away making conversation with himself.  END
BEGIN NOW A chain of young girls in pleated skirts pass by, giggling like a flock of jailbait butterflies.  END
BEGIN NOW I scratch at my crotch, freeing the sack from the space next to my leg where it was sticking.  END
BEGIN NOW A fat girl in all black with a Linkin Park backpack waddles by with her pants riding up her ass.  END
BEGIN NOW Spiked belt muffining her belly over the edge. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen the gentrification of punk rock culture.  END
BEGIN NOW I have read bestsellers of shock jock pop culture plastic wrapped piss fiction.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve met shysters and charlatans, sinners and shit talkers that make millions.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve seen the split second attention deficit party prose play out over the earphones and dance floors of America.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve seen communication turn into a convenience.  END
BEGIN NOW Faith turn into a mark of stupidity.  END
BEGIN NOW And somewhere along the line life became expensive.  END
BEGIN NOW Somehow survival became a charity operation for anyone that lacked the balls to break a few necks.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve witnessed the new labels.  END

BEGIN NOW I’ve seen blind faith go hand in hand with right wing extremist politics.  END
BEGIN NOW People convincing themselves that loving means hating.  END
BEGIN NOW That saving people means submission.  END
BEGIN NOW That sex without love is fucking and that’s just fine.  END
BEGIN NOW And slut is just a word that jealous people use.  END
BEGIN NOW This pervasive, perverse feeling that it’s all been done before and all we have left are post modern retro revivals.  END
BEGIN NOW Even those are sold in specialty shops.  END

BEGIN NOW  An Asian girl with thick black rimmed glasses, lotus tattoo on her right sleeve and a well worn CBGB shirt clings to her perked, petite breasts walks behind sending a text message.  END
BEGIN NOW I flick the butt burned to the filter into an already littered street.  END

BEGIN NOW I’ve still got an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a pair of shoes passed out in the shadows.  END
BEGIN NOW I face the water watching the yachts, and a tour boat blows the horn while people with foreign accents cheer, making their way to the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW I woke up and coughed until my throat was a dessert.  END
BEGIN NOW I coughed the sand of my lungs until the blood rained into the kitchen sink.  END
BEGIN NOW My gums spat blood on the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW My nostrils bleed by my breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW Scabs on my arms made me scratch.  END
BEGIN NOW My skin gave way, preferring to leave as soon as possible.  END

BEGIN NOW The coughing continued.  END
BEGIN NOW I boiled salt water, thinking some ancient medical text advised gargling in times like these.  END
BEGIN NOW I tried three times only to purge the water I could stomach back into the sink.  END
BEGIN NOW My finger nails were caked with dead skin and dried blood.  END
BEGIN NOW My teeth ached in an abandoned way.  END
BEGIN NOW Once pearly, now orphans with empty stomachs in the emergency room of my mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW Sitting like aged granite tombstones in the desolate cemetery of my face. END

BEGIN NOW All bait laden and set.  END
BEGIN NOW Springs at the ready, full of tension, beckoning, inviting, seductive.  END
BEGIN NOW The mice were in the hall, under the trash cans and rarely around.  END
BEGIN NOW Their relation to the traps was an orbiting curiosity and cautious dance of calculated proportions.  END
BEGIN NOW The blind man sat in a chair with a Velcro grin, lips parting in dehydrated fashion, stuck together and peeled apart like the first pair of shoes to be worn on day one of grade school when some scavenger immigrant family moves to Los Angles for the first time with their first generation American children, waiting for the under the table maintenance jobs, house cleaning, housekeeping, tile laying landscaping manual labor plumber on the weekends to keep the Tapatio bottle full bullshit work that white people refuse to do anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW The blind man looks at the traps in an audio not so much visual way.  END
BEGIN NOW He observes his traps and waits with all the patience of a vulture circling high above a stranded hiker wandering the deserts just past the grand canyon, wondering where exactly the rest of the tour went off to after he limped off to piss into the river.  END
BEGIN NOW The mice have heard stories, scattered over generations.  END
BEGIN NOW Tall tales mentioned in passing between old rats and grandfather mice with patchy fur and geriatric paws, chipped incisors and flea problems.  END
BEGIN NOW There are traps, they’d say.  END
BEGIN NOW There are traps with riches beyond comprehension, full of all the wonders of old milk fat, harden by years of careful negligence, aged to perfection in the basements of ancient Frenchmen, stacked and labeled and forgotten by the cellar door of a strega nonna somewhere in Tuscany.  END
BEGIN NOW But be not deceived by the smells and sights of so much cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW Before a bite can be bitten, before a morsel can be moved, a snap, a clap and a broken neck and never to return.  END
BEGIN NOW Only a twitch, an exhale forced, and only a limp left if you’re lucky enough.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time before when the eyes still worked and the old man went on house calls for sixty dollars an hour to the bored house wives of America.  END
BEGIN NOW He would stroke his plunger and ease the flow of his words to scavenger scraps of unused vaginal tracts for his own amusement.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time before the blindness when his own plumbing worked like the aqueduct archetypes’ of their roman predecessors.  END
BEGIN NOW But now there was his mice and the traps.  END

BEGIN NOW Sunday of my youth meant church and the functions there of.  END
BEGIN NOW Sunday did not mean breakfast.  END
BEGIN NOW Sunday for my youth meant a nine a.m.  END
BEGIN NOW curtain call with all the priests and accoutrements that services provided.  END
BEGIN NOW But then I became a man and put away childish things and then Sunday meant brunch or lazy sex in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW Le Petit Mort between the sheets of a shack in middle of downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW Slow rising, hard up and hard on and rock on top of me because I’m still half away and you must have all the motivation of wanting one more fling at the thing we like to call sex.  END
BEGIN NOW Thank god for you and the communion between your legs.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the kind of breakfast I can really get behind.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the kind of hindquarter headlong give me head to finish and thrust away to a few seconds of scatterbrained euphoric why are you still here and what I really mean is good morning kind of day.  END
BEGIN NOW Sunday is perfect for eggs, but certainly not the kind all up in your uterus.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so good fried, but neither am I, so I’m pretty sure we can compromise.  END
BEGIN NOW We can lay lazy for a while and wait until one of our phones rings.  END
BEGIN NOW When the sound comes it will be vexing and welcome, like the neighbor that lacks timing or common courteously, because we’re neighbors and he thinks that means he’s always welcome despite company and circumstances and maybe he needs a cup of sugar or some toilet paper but I haven’t bothered with pants and she hasn’t bothered to clean what could have been our children from her thigh, the creamy untouched by sun milky white that would grace so many bowl of cereal consumed after church on so many Sundays of my childhood.  END
BEGIN NOW In the parking lot of lost ambitions she stalls the motor of the used car that ambled up the hills and valleys of a place we used to call home.  END
BEGIN NOW In the dusk light she gives up on cranking the key one more time and looks over at the passenger seat where I sit staring ahead and not bothering with eye contact on a such a tedious night for conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW Afraid that she might try and coax some kind of current state of affairs piece out of me, that I might be tired enough to speak like I cared enough to tune her out so that she’d still be pretty enough to kiss goodnight after all was said and I was done and we could be go home and not think about each other and what that means and whatever may come and as long as I do, I don’t really care.

BEGIN NOW Some how you ended up in line and then in the drivers seat and then everyone just took turns slamming into you and no one wanted to take responsibility for the years of chiropractic care resulting from repeated bumps and jostled and whiplash and all you wanted was a ride home and by you I mean me, because I don’t know what the fuck you’re thinking about, but I have an idea telegraphed by the light bulb that refuses to turn off despite my firmly closing the passenger side door and waiting for you to pull up to my house.

BEGIN NOW Not that he’s fat or anything.  END
BEGIN NOW More so we just have a light table without so much a sturdy base line and it’s fairly easy to upset.  END

BEGIN NOW She liked anal and I liked her for the novelty of the whole idea.  END
BEGIN NOW She would ask me to bite her and she would say harder.  END
BEGIN NOW She wanted blood, mostly hers and enough to make it visible and poignant.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a drama queen in the sense that she graduated high school as the president of the thespian society.  END
BEGIN NOW Long black hair that slacked off in perpetual apathy outside the window of her Volkswagen.  END
BEGIN NOW She was one of those girls.  END
BEGIN NOW A pout you could rest a stack of seventeen magazines on.  END
BEGIN NOW All the eyeshadow of Gary Glitter and David Bowie caked on like a shield from the cheery happy go lucky we can do anything and accomplishments are yours for the taking mentality of the 90s coupled with bitter optimism and bandwagon nonchalance.  END
BEGIN NOW She liked a good slap on the face or the ass.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t see much difference.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a thing for gluttonous fellatio, enough to choke on and enough to make her vomit just enough to coat my cock before she could finger force a few inches into her rectum.  END
BEGIN NOW She was one of those girls. END
BEGIN NOW The toilet bowl is a place for collections.  END

BEGIN NOW But I’m a  ice guy.  END
BEGIN NOW And we don’t have to go there. END
BEGIN NOW The vag.  END
BEGIN NOW The vagoo.  END

BEGIN NOW The vagina.  END
BEGIN NOW Something or other about this or that.  END
BEGIN NOW A subtraction problem where my penis is a minus and all that’s left is the remainder and long division is completely out of the question.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, there’s something you should know.  END
BEGIN NOW A point I make and break the silence of so many mornings and mourning’s like funerals where deep in the earth we sink another coffin and coughing roommates mucus makes it’s way to the trash cans like corpses making albums destined for the used record stores of so many sidewalk sales and into the great vag we plunge to unclog the mind and clear the head and the little head spurts to leave us panting and gasping and dying inside because it was just a fluke and  either of us meant to be there at the time.  END
BEGIN NOW It was just a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to believe me.  END
BEGIN NOW But still, you should douche that demon, you smell like a fish market that’s been out of operation for a decade since the maintenance crew went on strike due to union issues and health problems and everyone else has just been avoiding the place because of bad juju and bad publicity and ghost stories about phantom cocks that haunt the caverns of the space between the legs you use to get from a to b and now all that’s left is a void where I can hear my echo if I scream a tongue twister loud enough.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s the past and this is the present and for Christmas all I wanted was one more dive off the deep end into the hole I used to call home and you would knock on wood and let me in and then together we could reinact the beast with two backs t hat brought us here in t he first place.  END
BEGIN NOW And fuck your fanstasies, because that’s beautiful. END
BEGIN NOW Humanity has been in need for decades.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a whole organization devoted to the idea.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re called habitat for humanity and they must be as silly as the rest of us.  END
BEGIN NOW  A habitat.  END
BEGIN NOW A home a place to stop and kick off the shoes you should be wearing a contributing member of society.  END
BEGIN NOW But no matter if you lack shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that the habitat for humanity can provide them for you.  END
BEGIN NOW But fuck those guys.  END
BEGIN NOW As if they know.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have time to be a part of an organization that builds homes, you must have one enough for yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have the kind of time needed to build a habitat for humanity, that I mean goddamn.  END
BEGIN NOW Once upon a time there was a sign, now stolen by your’s truly, that stated Habitat restoration in progress.  END
BEGIN NOW The sign was on a fence in a lagoon where once I stared at the stars with a shell shocked girl with a  warm bed and hot chocolate late night conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW A lagoon where I was busted by the cops in the company of three underage girls and a half case of the finest Mexican beer money could buy.  END
BEGIN NOW But the sign still lingers, announcing to all oncomers the current state of the place I like to live.  END
BEGIN NOW The current state is and will always be, in progress.  END
BEGIN NOW A never to be complete kind of operation.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure that sign was meant in similar vain.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty sure that section of forest wasn’t going to grow back any faster.  END
BEGIN NOW But the sign is gone and that’s as done as it’s going to get.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature will take it’s sweet ass time and I will take my sweet ass sign. END
BEGIN NOW Solamente o solo mio the drum solo beat down beat off beets for dinner kind of summer dream.  END
BEGIN NOW Flying solo, cockpit like you’ve never seen before, not even in the movies, baby.  END
BEGIN NOW Alone is a way of going solo and being independent and it’s all me and all or nothing and my own two feet and nothing else because really that’s all I’ve got.  END
BEGIN NOW You ever been stranded without a care or a ticket or a pass or direction for your erection and that’s all there is to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Spiraling downward into reckless, neck-less like the fat from a chin making headway into the belly of a back problem handicapped slumped into himself, folding into bulbous extension of a transubstantiated stomach problem. END
BEGIN NOW Around this time of year you’ll wonder how cloth can get so cold.  END
BEGIN NOW If you stepped outside right now your breath would be a plume of steam.  END
BEGIN NOW There should be snow on the ground; it should always be overcast and around twenty degrees.  END
BEGIN NOW But since you live on the coast, and since you’re not that far north, it might as well be autumn.  END
BEGIN NOW Mind you, it’s still freezing.  END
BEGIN NOW Mind you, it’s still too cold for a swim.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what time of year it is.  END
BEGIN NOW Around December twenty-third.  END
BEGIN NOW Give or take a few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW You haven’t bothered to start December twenty-third, and neither has this girl that lives in a studio down off Ocean Street.  END
BEGIN NOW She has no desire to open her eyes when they do.  END
BEGIN NOW She has no inclination whatsoever to get out of bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Half open eyes peer up at the ceiling, at the chipped paint and plaster walls.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls the blankets tighter and turns on her side, going fetal.  END
BEGIN NOW The heater hasn’t been working for the last week.  END
BEGIN NOW The landlord hasn’t done a damn thing about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Shivering, the girl tries to find some kind of warmth between layers of blankets.  END
BEGIN NOW An alarm clock makes some noise; an old clock radio with big knobs to control the frequency and volume.  END
BEGIN NOW She slaps the snooze button habitually.  END
BEGIN NOW  She rolls over to her other side and tries to shut her eyes again.  END
BEGIN NOW  In the apartment above her she can hear the couple getting up.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone is yelling “God damn it!” repeatedly.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a loud thump and a woman is crying.  END
BEGIN NOW Then footsteps.  END
BEGIN NOW A door opens and slams shut.  END
BEGIN NOW More footsteps.  END
BEGIN NOW The crying turns into sobbing and our girl downstairs drifts off to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW The clock radio buzzes back to life a while later.  END
BEGIN NOW From beneath the covers, her hand emerges and slaps hard on top of it.  END
BEGIN NOW The noise from the radio is replaced by sounds from upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW The crying has transformed into moaning and rhythmic bumps; squeaks from a box frame and heavy breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW Resigned to being awake, the girl’s eyes are open now.  END
BEGIN NOW Hair shimmers around her on the pillow like a frozen splash of cranberry juice.  END
BEGIN NOW If eyes were scents, she would see the world through freshly baked bread.  END
BEGIN NOW A yawn escapes longwinded, stretching her face out of sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Her legs slide to the side and out, off the bed.  END
BEGIN NOW She wraps herself in the blankets and shuffles to the bathroom.  END
BEGIN NOW The water faucet turns on and she waits until the temperature is right to wash her face.  END
BEGIN NOW She studies the mirror looking for changes, checking to see what needs to be done. END
BEGIN NOW The door upstairs opens and slams shut.  END
BEGIN NOW Now three people are yelling.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they take turns, other times their voices collide and weave themselves into nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW A woman screams, “You fucking bastard!” And a man responds with a series of shut ups.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he says shut the fuck up.  END
BEGIN NOW Downstairs, the girl in the mirror rolls her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW All she has to say is “Jesus Fucking Christ.” She says it to her reflection and she says it softly.  END
BEGIN NOW She brushes her teeth and brushes her hair and lets the blankets fall around her feet.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands in a sweater and sweat pants.  END
BEGIN NOW Her long cranberry juice hair is stranded in various spots around her sweater and the blankets.  END
BEGIN NOW She plucks her eye brows, creating perfect symmetry.  END
BEGIN NOW Her nose wrinkles and she squints at herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles and carries the blankets back to her bed, throwing them in a pile on top.  END
BEGIN NOW In the closet she finds a fresh sweater, a pair of jeans, a shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW The clothes she wears are replaced piece by piece until she feels complete.  END
BEGIN NOW The old clothes are tossed as they come off, landing on the bed and the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW A pair of socks, a pair of shoes, her purse, her phone, keys.  END
BEGIN NOW A lighter and three cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW She touches up her lips and eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW The eye liner and lipstick, careful not to get any on her teeth, careful to make sure everything is perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles at herself as soon as she feels everything has been done.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a smile like the first pull of beer after a long day’s work.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts her emerald coat on, the one that brings out her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Buttoning it right up to the neck, she checks the apartment one last time and locks the door behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW The street is crisp.  END
BEGIN NOW The pavement is chilled; the air can cut through any amount of wool.  END
BEGIN NOW Scarves, hats, gloves, stockings, anything to add another layer.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to block that awful cold out.  END
BEGIN NOW Breathing in smoke helps.  END
BEGIN NOW Breathing in hot nicotine always helps.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts a cigarette to her lips.  END
BEGIN NOW A baby blue Bic is produced and flicked.  END
BEGIN NOW The flame hits the tip making a cherry, starting a spark, setting a fire.  END
BEGIN NOW She inhales deep and exhales slow into the noon day sun, mixing the smoke with the fog of her breath.  END
BEGIN NOW She aims her body at Water Street, cutting down the sidewalk in a pair of maroon Converse high-tops.  END
BEGIN NOW Her phone has been silent all morning and this is a bad sign.  END
BEGIN NOW No news is neglectful news.  END
BEGIN NOW She is being left out.  END
BEGIN NOW But she refuses to initiate.  END
BEGIN NOW People have to come to her.  END
BEGIN NOW Only come to her if you have something to offer.  END
BEGIN NOW Standards are high.  END
BEGIN NOW They have to be.  END
BEGIN NOW There are too many people looking for a hand out, for a free ride, a free lunch, or a hand up.  END
BEGIN NOW Those people need to help themselves, she figures.  END
BEGIN NOW This world is a cruel bitch, and Mother Nature is an indifferent bitch of a mother.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Two can play that game.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks the cigarette butt into a bush and blows out a last cloud.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes Water to Front Street, Front to Pacific Avenue.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes people still sleeping.  END
BEGIN NOW Large lumps of blankets scattered on benches by the river, hunched over in the alcoves of buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW Under bushes and bus stops.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes a face breaks loose.  END
BEGIN NOW The faces are all the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Unwashed, unshaven, sun tanned and ridden with scars.  END
BEGIN NOW The eyes are always sharp and desperate.  END
BEGIN NOW One can only pull a coat so close, and your own arms only hold you so tight.  END
BEGIN NOW The closer she gets to downtown, the more intense the scents change.  END
BEGIN NOW Early afternoon exhaust, the cafes in full grind.  END
BEGIN NOW Coffee and pedestrians, car fumes and bums.  END
BEGIN NOW The public service workers are just finishing cleaning the streets, picking up her cigarette butts from last night.  END
BEGIN NOW Picking up the cellophane wrappers, receipts, and waste of every night’s parade.  END
BEGIN NOW A small Hispanic woman sweeps broken glass into a large metal dust pan.  END
BEGIN NOW She sweeps it out from the doorway of one of the bars and into a trash can.  END
BEGIN NOW Broken glass falls on broken glass.  END
BEGIN NOW A jack hammer hums and pounds away in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW Middle aged women in groups of two pass by with shopping bags.  END
BEGIN NOW Families pass by with paper cups and plastic lids.  END
BEGIN NOW She counts seven people playing guitars and singing, mostly to themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Two of them are singing Bob Dylan songs.  END
BEGIN NOW One of them is a girl with short brown hair and a newsboy cap.  END
BEGIN NOW She wears a long, dark blue skirt and a faded grey cardigan.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s singing The Times They Are a Changin’ with passionate understanding.  END
BEGIN NOW She can’t be more than twenty.  END
BEGIN NOW For all her effort she gets a shiny quarter.  END
BEGIN NOW The quarter is dropped on bended knee.  END
BEGIN NOW It lands on a bed of nickels and dimes.  END
BEGIN NOW The girls smile at each other and nod.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for something.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for trying.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for singing along.  END
BEGIN NOW A man leaves a group of other men standing a circle, conversing.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaves and hurries after the girl walking down the street. END
BEGIN NOW “Baby girl!” He says.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Baby!” But she’s so used to that. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Baby, how you been? Remember me from the other night? We talked for two hours and you took all my smokes.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh,” she says, “Oh, hi James.” END
BEGIN NOW “Jake.” He says. END
BEGIN NOW “Jake, right.” END
BEGIN NOW “I tried calling you the other night, where’ve you been?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, you know, out and about.” She keeps walking and he walks beside her. END
BEGIN NOW “I never seen you since Baby, where you gotta be that’s better than around me?” END
BEGIN NOW “With friends, you know.” She keeps her cool; she keeps her eyes ahead of her. END
BEGIN NOW “You must have some interesting friends.” END
BEGIN NOW “Lots.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Listen, hey, not so fast.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatcha doin’ tonight?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll be some place, call me.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure.” He says.  END
BEGIN NOW “Bye.” END
BEGIN NOW She walks on and he stands there, shaking his head.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s going to call her, but she’s not going to pick up. END
BEGIN NOW She turns into a wooden doorway and walks up to the counter of a coffee shop.  END
BEGIN NOW A long wooden bar stretches down most of the length of the place.  END
BEGIN NOW The smells of fresh ground, roasted espresso beans waft about.  END
BEGIN NOW Hints of chocolate and toasted bagels.  END
BEGIN NOW Milk is steamed, coffee percolates.  END
BEGIN NOW Conversations come and go while students tick away at laptops.  END
BEGIN NOW There are tables, there are chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s some old lady erasing a crossword puzzle. END
BEGIN NOW “Abby! Good morning sweetheart, how are you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh God, I’m glad to see you.  END
BEGIN NOW I just ran into that awful guy from last week.” END
BEGIN NOW “The one with the argyle sweater and shiny shoes? What was so bad about him?” END
BEGIN NOW “That was his friend; I’m talking about the blond with the gap tooth.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just so fucking obnoxious.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW He was terrible.  END
BEGIN NOW Why the hell did you give him your number anyway?” END
BEGIN NOW “Drank too much and wasn’t thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he’ll be good for something some time.” She shrugs, “Anyways, spare something hot for a cold girl to drink?” END
BEGIN NOW “A little mocha for a little lady? I think I can do that, hold on.” END
BEGIN NOW Behind the counter, the drink is prepared.  END
BEGIN NOW She gets out the chocolate, steams the milk, presses the espresso and everything finds a way into a paper cup. END
BEGIN NOW “Whipped cream, mayhaps?” The coffee shop girl inquires, “Sprinkles? Chocolate shavings? Nutmeg? Cinnamon?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, no thanks.  END
BEGIN NOW Not today.  END
BEGIN NOW This is perfect.” Abby tries to takes a short sip, blowing over the top of the cup in between attempts. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, now what are you up to?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not really sure yet.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I just want to walk for a while.” END
BEGIN NOW A young couple is standing behind Abby, looking over the drink menu hung up behind the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW They hold each other around the waist and talk in low voices.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy is wearing a long brown coat and a department store clearance rack shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s decent enough for church on Sundays; it even has buttons.  END
BEGIN NOW The shirt is complimented by some well worn tennis shoes and faded blue jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl is standing in black polyester pants and sheep skin slippers.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a hooded sweater on that’s a few sizes too big for her petite frame.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair is tied in a pony tail of golden brunette strands.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re being cute together and Abby can feel it over her shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW “I should get going.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for the coffee, Love.  END
BEGIN NOW Call me later, let’s get a drink.” END
BEGIN NOW “Any time Abs, I’ll call you.  END
BEGIN NOW Love.” END
BEGIN NOW The girls wave goodbye and smile at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW The couple steps up to the counter and the barista greets them, inquiring about their purchase.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl clings to the boy and doesn’t speak to anyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face is half buried in his chest.  END
BEGIN NOW He begins; END
BEGIN NOW “Umm, I’ll take a large black coffee and she’ll have a small soy chai.  END
BEGIN NOW To go please.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW The financial aspect of the transaction is taken care of; the boy pays for everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby hears the register close and closes the door behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW Back on the sidewalk, back past the shops the shoppers and panhandlers.  END
BEGIN NOW She can hear a fiddler about a block and a half away.  END
BEGIN NOW A man plays conga drums in a steady rhythm, never wavering from the same beat.  END
BEGIN NOW A family of four passes by, three children and a mother.  END
BEGIN NOW Mom has circles under her eyes, her cheeks are sunken and near skeletal.  END
BEGIN NOW The children pester her for ice cream, chocolate things and toys.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks like she could leave them in a store somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW She could send them off to look at things and turn right around and go back out that door.  END
BEGIN NOW She could get in the car and drive.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d drive south until the gas tank was full of fumes.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d find a filling station and wash the windshield, maybe get an oil change and a full tank.  END
BEGIN NOW And then South.  END
BEGIN NOW South until everything felt okay again.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids would find a way.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone that likes kids would take care of them.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re some decent people left in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s someone somewhere that still cares about other people’s children.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby fumbles in her purse for a new cigarette, leaving one left.  END
BEGIN NOW One last cigarette means a trip to the corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW That means a friendly exchange with the mustache guy that never leaves the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW Mustache guy with a baseball cap and a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby puts on a smile of her own.  END
BEGIN NOW The door is already open.  END
BEGIN NOW The rows and rows of alcohol in glass and plastic bottles stand neatly around the walls.  END
BEGIN NOW Shelves of snacks and other beverages fill up most of floor space.  END
BEGIN NOW A fine layer of dust has settled on everything except the floor between the door and the register. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, hello Abby! Merry Christmas.” Each word is filtered through his full black broom of a moustache.  END
BEGIN NOW The hairs are long enough to cover his lower lip when his mouth is closed. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, how are you?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m well, I’m well.  END
BEGIN NOW Pack of filters?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, thanks and also, could I get that small bottle of Jameson? Not the shot, the next one up.  END
BEGIN NOW The flasky one.” END
BEGIN NOW “A little something for your coffee? Any plans for Christmas? See your family?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t think so, no.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really want to.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not really feeling it this year.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t stand buying things for people.” END
BEGIN NOW “I see.” END
BEGIN NOW “How about you?” She says handing him a five dollar bill. END
BEGIN NOW “Working.  END
BEGIN NOW Working all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just another Tuesday.” He hands her two dimes and three pennies. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I know what you mean.” She pauses.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well, thanks again.  END
BEGIN NOW Take care of yourself.” END
BEGIN NOW “I will, I will.  END
BEGIN NOW You too.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks again Abby.  END
BEGIN NOW Bye.” END
BEGIN NOW Abby places the whiskey in her purse.  END
BEGIN NOW She taps the pack of cigarettes on the counter twice and puts them in as well.  END
BEGIN NOW She turns and walks back out the doorway.  END
BEGIN NOW At the intersection she looks in each direction.  END
BEGIN NOW She could back track.  END
BEGIN NOW She could cross a bridge and make a loop.  END
BEGIN NOW She could wander up to Mission Street and poke around up there.  END
BEGIN NOW Or she could keep on walking to the beach.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby continues on Pacific, past the last line of shops.  END
BEGIN NOW Past the house of cards, the magic shop and the car dealer.  END
BEGIN NOW Past the block of apartments and the bike shop.  END
BEGIN NOW The taco place on the hillside and then it flattens out.  END
BEGIN NOW Then you can see the wharf stretching into the sea.  END
BEGIN NOW You can see the Boardwalk and Casino.  END
BEGIN NOW The Casino that’s really an arcade.  END
BEGIN NOW A large room filled with children dropping quarters into slots.  END
BEGIN NOW A room full of colorful, flashing lights and mechanical carnival noise. END
BEGIN NOW Abby drinks her coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW She cuts across the street towards the small café on the corner before the wharf starts.  END
BEGIN NOW A man is sitting down at the patio furniture in front.  END
BEGIN NOW A cup steams in front of him and he smokes slowly, resting in the sunlight shoved between cracks in the clouds.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a book open in front of him and a hat on the table.  END
BEGIN NOW His feet are resting on the chair next to him.  END
BEGIN NOW The soles of his shoes are almost worn through.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks up at Abby as she walks by.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks her up and down and looks at her face, hoping and waiting for her to turn and acknowledge him.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby walks by and notes him peripherally.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes linger on the door as it closes. END
BEGIN NOW The girl behind this counter is standing poised.  END
BEGIN NOW Her right arm is bent with her wrist behind her head.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a stack of quarters on her elbow.  END
BEGIN NOW In one swift motion she flings her hand down, pivoting on her shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a sound of loose change flying against the wall and a few landing in her hand.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ah shit, a dollar short!” She catches Abby looking at her.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh Jesus, sorry about that.  END
BEGIN NOW What can I getcha?” She hops behind the register and brightens up a little.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes are soft and light green.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair is curly, dirty blond.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands all in black, at the ready to brew something or scoop some ice cream.  END
BEGIN NOW “Umm, just a bottle of water.  END
BEGIN NOW What was that you were doing when I came in?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, that? I was trying to beat the Fonz’s record.  END
BEGIN NOW The Fonz could catch eight dollars in six stacks off his elbow.  END
BEGIN NOW Someday I’m going to get nine.” She beams. END
BEGIN NOW “What’s your record so far?” Abby cracks a smile. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, well just now I’m up to two dollars in four stacks, up a dollar from yesterday.” She pulls a bottle of water from the cooler behind her. END
BEGIN NOW Abby laughs a little, “That’s pretty cool.  END
BEGIN NOW At this rate you’ll make eight by New Years.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, yeah I hope so.” She looks pensively at nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW Then snapping back to attention, “It’s a buck fifty for the water.” END
BEGIN NOW Abby digs out some change and a dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW “Sorry I don’t have many quarters, but maybe I’ll come back with some later.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’d be awesome, thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll do what I can.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for the water.” END
BEGIN NOW “Anytime.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s kinda my job.” Her eyes are bright and sincere.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles without showing any teeth.  END
BEGIN NOW She begins searching for the stray quarters as soon as Abby turns around. END
BEGIN NOW Abby walks outside past the guy at the table.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s reading now and leaning back, resting the spine of the book against the edge of the table.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby can read Hesse but nothing else.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy looks up and catches her trying to read the title.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby turns quickly and walks toward the wharf.  END
BEGIN NOW Her shoes hit pavement then wood.  END
BEGIN NOW She lights her third cigarette of the day.  END
BEGIN NOW She inhales deep into her diaphragm and exhales with a sigh.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks all the way to the end of the wharf, sipping on her bottle of water and smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW She leans against the railing, looking out across the water.  END
BEGIN NOW The ocean stretches on and on.  END
BEGIN NOW Blue and white break.  END
BEGIN NOW Patches of seaweed and kelp.  END
BEGIN NOW Abby removes the bottle of whiskey and puts the water away.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a long pull and swallows.  END
BEGIN NOW She coughs lightly and takes one last drag of her cigarette, flicking the butt as far as she can.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottle goes up again to her lips and she drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea lions are barking at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW A few boats float around.  END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey burns down her throat, into her guts.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuel for the machine.  END
BEGIN NOW And in Abby’s purse her phone rings.  END
BEGIN NOW When you describe someone like a doll, you infer smooth skin and delicate features.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a fragile smile or a look or porcelain indifference.  END
BEGIN NOW The eyes could be flat and hard like river rocks or a prismatic well returning in echoes the kinds of things only meant to be whispered into subterrainian water sources. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't sleep so well.  END
BEGIN NOW Rest came reluctantly in short bursts of shut eye.  END
BEGIN NOW I dreamed about the doll sleeping next to me.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a way of existing in an adorable manner.  END
BEGIN NOW Even her snoring made me smile.  END
BEGIN NOW While she slept and I couldn't, I would look her over.  END
BEGIN NOW Not thinking that I was unreasonably lucky or wondering how this came about or what had I done to deserve this.  END
BEGIN NOW I adored in the simple beauty she lived in. END
BEGIN NOW Her short black hair takes an hour to make right.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a recipe she's kept for years.  END
BEGIN NOW The process is very specific.  END
BEGIN NOW There are steps and certain procedures.  END
BEGIN NOW She does this ritual with her hair every morning. END
BEGIN NOW My favorite part of this whole process starts around nine or ten in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Right after she wakes up for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair has started a riot.  END
BEGIN NOW Certain strands are staging a protest.  END
BEGIN NOW Others are marching on city hall with torches.  END
BEGIN NOW Her scalp is Catholic but her hair is protestant.  END
BEGIN NOW The IRA has set up shop in her eye brows. END
BEGIN NOW She shifts her lithe dancer's body on leopard print sheets.  END
BEGIN NOW I hold her close with an arm like a paper clip, keeping my records together.  END
BEGIN NOW My other arm is under her pillow and my hand is riot control, combing through the madness of her hair. END
BEGIN NOW She opens an eye at the mirror on the wall next to us.  END
BEGIN NOW For a minute half of my face and half of her's are visible.  END
BEGIN NOW Mine rising like a harvest moon over a field of snow resting on her skin.  END
BEGIN NOW All I can do is kiss her cheek and smile.  END
BEGIN NOW She has that kind of effect on me. END
BEGIN NOW She's the kind of girl that asks, "Well, now what should we do” and I'll say, "Let's get a twelve pack of cheap beer and go to the ocean." And she'll ask, "Should we buy cigarettes too?" END
BEGIN NOW She says she's crazy but she's never been too unreasonable for me.  END
BEGIN NOW She says she's crazy but I don't think she's so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW She says she's crazy but I say she makes more sense to me than most people. END
BEGIN NOW I've seen her cry and her make up is a high tide flood water mascara river running down her cheeks and she coughs and shoots another shot of bourbon down. END
BEGIN NOW I've seen her look right through me, the wall behind me, all the buildings in town.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what she's looking at.  END
BEGIN NOW I think it must be the ocean. END
BEGIN NOW When the doll maker formed her, he carved her eyes out of ocean water and took snow to mold her face.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair was imported from Ireland.  END
BEGIN NOW It was made from the ashes of a church that used to stand somewhere around Cork County.  END
BEGIN NOW The doll maker found a creek near an old whiskey distillery.  END
BEGIN NOW He took that creek and fashioned it into her smile.  END
BEGIN NOW To make her body, the doll maker went to an old ballroom with high chandeliers, dusty from years of hanging around.  END
BEGIN NOW He found the music resting in the walls, antique acoustics and echoes from a time of dance cards and gowns that turned women into waltzing waterfalls.  END
BEGIN NOW He formed her body from that music.  END
BEGIN NOW Her bones were made from marble taken from the tombstones in cemeteries that make nice places to take a break on long, intoxicated walks home at just before dawn when the first autumn rains are squeezed from the grey sponges in the sky.  END
BEGIN NOW The fire of her spirit was taken from the brutal forges of hell.  END
BEGIN NOW Stolen while Satan was sleeping off a mean hangover. END
BEGIN NOW He made her voice by taking the reflecting of a full moon off a lake, frozen over in a time long past when Vikings prepared for Valhalla by sharpening their axes and feeding the remains of their enemies to wolves. END
BEGIN NOW She gets out of bed and stretches her perfection towards heaven, mocking angels and the image of god.  END
BEGIN NOW Making a shape from the entirety of her being that reminds of me of watching honey drip off a recently dipped strawberry.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at me looking at her in a way that says, "You're very sweet, but I’m crazy and I will destroy you." END
BEGIN NOW I look at her and try to say, "You're not so bad, and I appreciate your continued existence.  END
BEGIN NOW Please continue." END
BEGIN NOW She disappears for a few minutes, finding water before huddling next to me again.  END
BEGIN NOW The warmth of her body is hot chocolate on the winter night of my childhood.  END
BEGIN NOW Her kiss is a good hot toddy on a cold night after a long day of work.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes me forget which one of us is sweet and which one of us is crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW She demands nothing of me and I demand nothing of her.  END
BEGIN NOW We laugh easy and always right on time.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t seem to mind my outbursts of pent up affection.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes sadness sneaks up on her and all I want to do is take her sadness and put it in a bottle, throw that bottle off a cliff and watch it float away on the waves of her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Hoping the tide will carry it far away and dash it against distant rocks, letting her sadness be lost at sea, never to return. END
BEGIN NOW I could say that she's cute, what I really mean is that cute was a concept that was spawned by pale imitations of her nature.  END
BEGIN NOW That no one really understands cuteness until she comes into your life.  END
BEGIN NOW By contrast, she makes kittens seem like kickable nuisances. END
BEGIN NOW What I’ve been meaning to say, is that she's a rare one.  END
BEGIN NOW What I’ve been trying to put into words is that there are some friends that fall into your life that you are forever grateful for.  END
BEGIN NOW What I mean is, some people crowd surf, some people dance, some like to sit in balconies and watch the show from a distance.  END
BEGIN NOW She is front and center, fists out and shit kicking boots.  END
BEGIN NOW She is a mosh pit of a woman.  END
BEGIN NOW And goddamn.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really know who Jah is.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve heard mention of the name, some vague notions about the general idea of Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW But do I have love for Jah? Now, love in what sense? There are many ways to love something or someone.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s tough love, lust love, friendly love, family love, futile love, romantic love, puppy love.  END
BEGIN NOW What kind of love does Jah want? Love is a dirty word.  END
BEGIN NOW When asked about my love for Jah, I couldn’t answer with any sense of seriousness. END
BEGIN NOW The asker of this question, and perhaps the embodiment of the answer, was a girl named Mouse.  END
BEGIN NOW Her real name starts with an s, but circumstances left the rest of the letters scattered.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a mouse of a girl.  END
BEGIN NOW Honey brunette hair, tangled, unwashed, exploded from her scalp.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair stuck to the oversized sweater she wore.  END
BEGIN NOW It fell in front of her eyes when she danced.  END
BEGIN NOW She stuck out in a crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW  The dive bar crowd especially.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone in pajama bottoms, any young girl in pajama bottoms and a sweater that wanders into a dive bar will turn a few heads.  END
BEGIN NOW If she dances between the pool tables.  END
BEGIN NOW If she waves her arms in slow motion and her body moves like a sheet hanging out to dry in the late afternoon sun.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s sure to get some kind of attention. END
BEGIN NOW I noticed her when she found a booth behind us.  END
BEGIN NOW She was dancing from the waist up and muttering to herself.  END
BEGIN NOW Being more insane then the two women next to me, I left without notice and sat with her.  END
BEGIN NOW I sat fascinated.  END
BEGIN NOW She was hypnotic.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a crazy hippie girl that seemed lost in time and space.  END
BEGIN NOW She sang along to a song that wasn’t playing on the jukebox.  END
BEGIN NOW I lit a cigarette and she took it right out of my mouth and it danced around her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She denied me access to my own cigarette, stealing drags when her dancing arms permitted.  END
BEGIN NOW Her front teeth were bent back and under developed.  END
BEGIN NOW Up close she looked sixteen.  END
BEGIN NOW This was when I asked her for a name and couldn’t catch all of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she asked me. END
BEGIN NOW Do you have love for Jah? END
BEGIN NOW I asked her who Jah was and why should I love him.  END
BEGIN NOW Jah is everything and made everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Jah is love.  END
BEGIN NOW Jah made you. END
BEGIN NOW My parents made me, I’m quite sure of it. END
BEGIN NOW No.  END
BEGIN NOW Jah made you.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you have love for Jah? END
BEGIN NOW How can I love something I don’t know? END
BEGIN NOW If you don’t have love for Jah, then how can I have love for you? END
BEGIN NOW She sat there smoking my cigarette now.  END
BEGIN NOW She sat there with her eyes fixed on mine.  END
BEGIN NOW She leans in close then takes my arm, jumping out of the booth.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to teach you something about Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW But first, we’re going to sit here on the sidewalk, by the house of cards and smoke another cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW We’re outside the bar now, we’re half a block down the sidewalk, sitting on it, backs to the entrance of some store.  END
BEGIN NOW I give her another cigarette; light her’s and then my own.  END
BEGIN NOW I ask her how old she is. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty four. END
BEGIN NOW You don’t look twenty four. END
BEGIN NOW I’m twenty four and I ran away from my husband.  END
BEGIN NOW We have two children.  END
BEGIN NOW But I can’t be a mother; I’m just no good for them.  END
BEGIN NOW So I ran away.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s for the better. END
BEGIN NOW She pulls on the cigarette and huddles against me.  END
BEGIN NOW Against the cold.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a man with dreadlocks.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m in love with him.  END
BEGIN NOW Is that so? END
BEGIN NOW Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows so much.  END
BEGIN NOW He has love for Jah. END
BEGIN NOW I see.  END
BEGIN NOW She huddles closer and rests her head on my knee. END
BEGIN NOW I’m so drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW Why am I so drunk? END
BEGIN NOW Because you drank.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what happens.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t eaten in two weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t eaten in two weeks are you going to feed me? I ate something from Jack in the Box this morning but I threw up.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m so hungry. END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t say anything for a while and flicks the rest of her cigarette into the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s go, she says.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to teach you something about Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW That must be why I’m here. END
BEGIN NOW She takes my arm and we start walking.  END
BEGIN NOW She steals my hat and claims it as her own, trying to trade me for a pink knit beanie she made.  END
BEGIN NOW  I keep stealing mine back.  END
BEGIN NOW I tell her that her name is Mouse. END
BEGIN NOW I’m much better than a mouse. END
BEGIN NOW But you are a mouse. END
BEGIN NOW No, I’m much better.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do things a mouse can’t do. END
BEGIN NOW But you have such tiny lips. END
BEGIN NOW These lips.  END
BEGIN NOW These lips can blow your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Right out of the water. END
BEGIN NOW Really? How can they do that? END
BEGIN NOW These lips can blow your mind right out of the water. END
BEGIN NOW I see. END
BEGIN NOW Where are we going? I’m so drunk. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know, I thought you were leading.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re crossing the bridge. END
BEGIN NOW We’re going to my friend’s house.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re walking me home.  END
BEGIN NOW But you don’t have love for Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t have love for Jah and you can leave me right here mister and walk somewhere else. END
BEGIN NOW She breaks free and walks ahead of me.  END
BEGIN NOW I take her arm again and she says END
BEGIN NOW No! You don’t have love for Jah and I can’t love you, you don’t have love for Jah. END
BEGIN NOW All I can do is look at her with sadness. END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to my friend’s house to smoke ganja.  END
BEGIN NOW Except he puts heroin in it.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t smoke heroin but I did so now I’m addicted.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I’m a junkie.  END
BEGIN NOW  He’s not really my friend.  END
BEGIN NOW Friend’s don’t do that.  END
BEGIN NOW But I’m going over there because I’m addicted to heroin now.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sometimes when I’m sleeping I can feel him in the room.  END
BEGIN NOW And I turn on the light and he’s in there and his hand will be on my leg and I’ll scream and run out of the house. END
BEGIN NOW I’m no stranger to sob stories.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve heard my fair share of chain yanking, leg pulling bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t believe everything she says.  END
BEGIN NOW If everything she said were true then maybe I was there to rescue her.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I could give her a shower and something to eat and some ganja without any heroin.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that’s how she was going to help me find love for Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re standing out in front of a block of apartments and she has stolen my hat again. END
BEGIN NOW Give me back my hat. END
BEGIN NOW It’s my hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch me rock it.  END
BEGIN NOW I look good in this hat.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s mine now. END
BEGIN NOW No, it’s my hat.  END
BEGIN NOW You have your own hat, see.  END
BEGIN NOW I put the hat on her head but lose my balance.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m leaning against her and she’s leaning against a van parked on the curb.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hat is on her head crooked. END
BEGIN NOW You pushed yourself against me! END
BEGIN NOW I lost my balance, I’m sorry. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to go in there! END
BEGIN NOW So don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW Stay with me for a while. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to smoke heroin! I don’t want to be touched by that man again! END
BEGIN NOW Hey, calm down, sit stay with me, smoke another cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW This she does and we sit on the curb.  END
BEGIN NOW Her head is in my lap again and I’m petting her hair, saying Mouse, Mouse.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes the noise that a person makes when they don’t want to be crying.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes noises like she’s fighting back tears.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s something inside me that turns on in situations like this.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s something that makes me want to fix things.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of a girl crying in your lap.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if it’s a poor, ragged junkie.  END
BEGIN NOW A runaway mother.  END
BEGIN NOW A married girl.  END
BEGIN NOW A dirty Rastafarian hippie girl with crooked front teeth and tiny lips.  END
BEGIN NOW A little Mouse that danced in a dive bar.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits up and leans on me.  END
BEGIN NOW My arm goes around her shoulder, rubs her back sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW I try to kiss her and she turns her face, pointing at her cheek. END
BEGIN NOW These lips are not for you.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t love Jah.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts her hands on my face, on my cheeks and calls me her handsome artist.  END
BEGIN NOW I look at her pleading, sad.  END
BEGIN NOW I look at her and realize that for the last thirty minutes I’ve been completely enchanted by this girl.  END
BEGIN NOW We were surrounded by realism but not between us.  END
BEGIN NOW We have created a shield against the world that’s two people wide.  END
BEGIN NOW Two drunks on the curb, as close as two people can be between clothing.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands up and falls down straight.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that means you should stay with me for a while longer. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW I go to kiss her again and she relents.  END
BEGIN NOW Her tiny lips kiss mine and pull away in sudden realization.  END
BEGIN NOW She gives in again and kisses me.  END
BEGIN NOW We stop and look into each other’s eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Me with sadness, she with a smile and tenderness.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hands touch my cheeks again and she pulls my face down.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls my face down until our foreheads touch.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to take her away.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to take her with me and just go.  END
BEGIN NOW Anywhere and everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW I know I’m staying.  END
BEGIN NOW I know it’s not time to migrate.  END
BEGIN NOW So I look at her with sadness.  END
BEGIN NOW I should go. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t say anything; all I can do is look at her.  END
BEGIN NOW She holds me close and I kiss her again.  END
BEGIN NOW I kiss her and hold it and we both lose balance and fall against the van again. END
BEGIN NOW That was a sign, she says.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a sign and I’ll find you again and you’ll look for me.  END
BEGIN NOW My handsome artist.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks away and our hands hold on a for another moment.  END
BEGIN NOW I watch her slip through a metal gate.  END
BEGIN NOW I watch her go and she never looks back. END
BEGIN NOW The book thief may be a klepto.  END
BEGIN NOW I was beginning to have my suspicions.  END
BEGIN NOW Two books and a few hours of my life have most certainly been stolen.  END
BEGIN NOW There is also the matter of my heart.  END
BEGIN NOW The little beat box for my blood.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t sure if she had taken it.  END
BEGIN NOW It was definitely missing.  END
BEGIN NOW A vital organ, perhaps the most crucial of all, had disappeared.  END
BEGIN NOW I noticed the damn thing was missing this morning when I stepped on a scale and found myself to be twenty or so pounds lighter then the last time.  END
BEGIN NOW I decided to check all the places where I have a tendency to lose things.  END
BEGIN NOW It was in my best interests to conduct a search.  END
BEGIN NOW I had a few ideas. END
BEGIN NOW No one at the bar had seen it, but they offered condolences and a drink to substitute my loss.  END
BEGIN NOW The drink did little for little for me but was gratefully accepted and appreciated.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender asked me if I remember the last time I saw my heart.  END
BEGIN NOW I told her the last clear memory occurred sometime about a year ago two stools down from where I was sitting.  END
BEGIN NOW I had spilled my drink and used it to mop up the mess.  END
BEGIN NOW She said a year ago is a long time to be missing something.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it ended up in the lost and found, next to the hats and jackets of many a black out night.  END
BEGIN NOW She checked and said there were a lot of sunglasses, but I was out of luck. END
BEGIN NOW I checked the bookstore to see if someone found it lying around and filed my heart away with the used books.  END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps somewhere between the mystery novels and the humor section with a price tag of three-fifty plus tax.  END
BEGIN NOW All the dust and neglect lead me to believe I was on the right track.  END
BEGIN NOW A customer service representative checked the computer for me and said they were all out right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I asked around at the buying counter and they told me to check back in a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW The books on the cart had nothing to offer except a collection of classic American short stories and a guide for learning Esperanto.  END
BEGIN NOW I left the bookstore with paperback novel lacking a beat.  END
BEGIN NOW I called around, but no one seemed to ever remember me having one in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone told me to check the bar, just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW I said that was the first place I looked.  END
BEGIN NOW They told me I should go back to the bar and stay there until my heart showed up.  END
BEGIN NOW I said that wasn’t a bad idea.  END
BEGIN NOW They asked me if I would wait for them when I got there.  END
BEGIN NOW I said I wasn’t sure I’d be going back until later.  END
BEGIN NOW They asked me to buy them a drink and I hung up. END
BEGIN NOW A thought came to me not so much like a flash, more like the dim flickering of a fluorescent bulb in a hospital waiting room.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe at the laundry mat.  END
BEGIN NOW I might have left my heart there.  END
BEGIN NOW Piled under all those lost socks.  END
BEGIN NOW A very reasonable assumption.  END
BEGIN NOW The laundry mat had little to offer except housewives in sweatpants and the smell of fabric softener.  END
BEGIN NOW In the corner at a wobbly table with impossible chairs sat an improbable person.  END
BEGIN NOW She was seated like a thunderstorm in late June.  END
BEGIN NOW In the deserts of Australia where the days are scalding and the nights are silent blocks of dry ice, there is a type of frog called notaden bennetti, or Catholic frogs because they wear crosses on their backs.  END
BEGIN NOW They bury themselves alive for months, burrowed under the sand in a kind of hibernation in expectation of a few short days of torrential downpour.  END
BEGIN NOW The continued existence of their species is dependent on brief moments of moisture.  END
BEGIN NOW The rain is essential for the frogs to mate.  END
BEGIN NOW Without the water the toads will die dehydrated virgins.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes are like raindrops hitting infinitely thirsty grains of sand.  END
BEGIN NOW Sitting across from her is an epileptic frog, shaking in anticipation of absorbing her every word.  END
BEGIN NOW The scene inspired me to drink heavily. END
BEGIN NOW Losing hope for the recovery of my centerpiece and drifting rapidly away from sobriety I made my way to the river in search of solace with a pint of whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s where I found the book thief.  END
BEGIN NOW She was skipping stones and whistling poorly to herself.  END
BEGIN NOW I found an agreeable rock to sit on and threw the empty bottle at the water.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of hollow glass making a fuss in a lazy river did little to startle her.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked at me and smiled the way children do at clowns making balloon animals. END
BEGIN NOW “I knew you’d show up.” She turns back to the river and throws a rock that skips five times.  END
BEGIN NOW “I had a feeling when I woke up this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it came to me in a dream.  END
BEGIN NOW The cat woke me up before I was ready and I guess my mind didn’t come back to consciousness for a minute, but I was pretty sure I should stop by the river.  END
BEGIN NOW The cat was being a needy little bitch and refused to leave me be.  END
BEGIN NOW He does this thing where he sits on my forehead in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW As if my forehead was his own personal throne.  END
BEGIN NOW I got up and fed the cat and came here.  END
BEGIN NOW Furry little beasty bitch cat waking me up.” She throws a larger stone in with a satisfying splash.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks over to my rock in expectation of party tricks and an inflated four legged creature.  END
BEGIN NOW “Aww, what’s wrong? You look like someone popped your balloon.” END
BEGIN NOW “I lost my heart and can’t find it anywhere.” END
BEGIN NOW “Poor baby.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you look under the couch cushions? I always lose shit there.  END
BEGIN NOW One time I lost my keys in the couch and couldn’t drive anywhere for a week.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to take a bus to work and that took forever.  END
BEGIN NOW The other passengers all smelled like stale cheese and shame.  END
BEGIN NOW One time this guy puked all over himself and the back seat.  END
BEGIN NOW We had to open all the windows and wait until we were off the freeway before the driver threw him off.  END
BEGIN NOW I finally found my keys when I was looking for laundry quarters.  END
BEGIN NOW I was so overjoyed that I stubbed my big toe on the coffee table in the excitement of being reunited with my keys.  END
BEGIN NOW My toe got all blue and looked so miserable that I couldn’t stand looking at it.  END
BEGIN NOW I wore one sock around the house for days until the color went away.  END
BEGIN NOW Such a fucking pain in the ass.” END
BEGIN NOW “Or the foot.” END
BEGIN NOW “Or the foot, yeah.” END
BEGIN NOW “You haven’t seen my heart have you?” END
BEGIN NOW “I didn’t think you were using it, so I thought I’d borrow it.  END
BEGIN NOW You really should take better care of it.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you didn’t even notice it was gone until now.  END
BEGIN NOW Honestly, it was in quite a state.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, you really should keep it on you at all times, not on a shelf next to your ambitions and pictures of your family.” END
BEGIN NOW “How long have you had it?” END
BEGIN NOW “A few months, maybe longer.” The book thief bites her lip and looks at the water.  END
BEGIN NOW “I have an idea,” she says.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes my heart out of her pocket and polishes it with her shirt sleeve.  END
BEGIN NOW “Make a wish.  END
BEGIN NOW And make it a good one.  END
BEGIN NOW When I was a kid and Thanksgiving came around, dad would finish carving the turkey and give me the wishbone.  END
BEGIN NOW But being an only child and all, I had no one to break the bone with.  END
BEGIN NOW I really didn’t feel like involving my parents in the ritual, so I made a wish with each hand and broke it by myself.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently my left hand is luckier.  END
BEGIN NOW You have a wish yet?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I got one.” END
BEGIN NOW The thief holds my heart in the palm of her hand and throws it up high over the water.  END
BEGIN NOW It lands in the river with a plunk. END
BEGIN NOW “What’d you wish for? Something wonderful?” END
BEGIN NOW “Can’t tell you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fine, be that way.  END
BEGIN NOW I never got any of my wishes.  END
BEGIN NOW Except this one time on my fourteenth birthday I was blowing out the candles and I wished that Corey Thompson would go to hell.  END
BEGIN NOW He was such an asshole and thought he was so cool.  END
BEGIN NOW My friend Monica had a huge crush on him.  END
BEGIN NOW I never understood her.  END
BEGIN NOW Two weeks later he was hit by a drunk driver in a red convertible.  END
BEGIN NOW Died in the hospital that night from severe impact damage.  END
BEGIN NOW Broke his legs, bits of glass in his face, punctured lung.  END
BEGIN NOW Practically liquefied him.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt like such a bitch.  END
BEGIN NOW Still didn’t go to his funeral though” She looks across the river at the opposite shore.  END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s get some coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Coffee sounds just about right.” END
BEGIN NOW I continue looking at the spot where my heart sank and thought about a kid kissing the windshield at sixty miles an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s get some coffee.” END
BEGIN NOW Vacation. END
BEGIN NOW She woke up and her voice was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a note next to her phone by the bed. END
BEGIN NOW "Had to get out of town for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW Hope you understand.  END
BEGIN NOW She sat on the edge of her bed re-reading the note.  END
BEGIN NOW Her suitcase was missing.  END
BEGIN NOW Along with a few shirts and a pair of jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW This had happened before.  END
BEGIN NOW She crumpled the note and tried to exclaim her dismay.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead of words or syllables, there was nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW She opened her mouth and silence.  END
BEGIN NOW Her thoughts jogged down the paths of her mind and into her lungs.  END
BEGIN NOW Her thoughts started back up intending to have her throat full of the kind of vibrations that turn air into sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead her thoughts slipped on the slickness of her tongue, tripped on the tip of her teeth and landed face first on her lips.  END
BEGIN NOW Despondency brushed over her features like a stroke from the hand of a skilled calligrapher.  END
BEGIN NOW She slumps back on the bed and wonders exactly how this is going to effect her day.  END
BEGIN NOW What day was it? Was it the kind of day when things needed doing? How much longer could this bed last? Can we keep this up until the voice came back? According to the phone it's a Wednesday and it's three-thirty.  END
BEGIN NOW Wednesday means a day of rest before the weekend begins to tighten like a spring, wound up to unleash the full horrors of the work week.  END
BEGIN NOW All warmth has faded from the sheets.  END
BEGIN NOW The chill of the mid-afternoon mid-Winter air clings to the skin of her legs.  END
BEGIN NOW Her torso clad in a shirt and her hair stood around in a frozen charge of electricity.  END
BEGIN NOW her right hand rubs her forehead, slides down to her mouth and brushes away the feeling of waking up to a voice on vacation. END
BEGIN NOW Her obligations for the day cleared up.  END
BEGIN NOW Her intentions not yet manifest.  END
BEGIN NOW She wonders about making plans or just feeling out the day.  END
BEGIN NOW About scheduling some people or keeping it open.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits back up and figures that it's time to get ready.  END
BEGIN NOW She adjusts to the day and cracks her joints and exhales.  END
BEGIN NOW She blinks often.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands and reaches her hands towards the ceiling, lifting her shirt off her ass in a way that constitutes a private show had there been an audience.  END
BEGIN NOW Her ass is worth a twenty dollar admission, show time unknown, duration a mystery, next show unscheduled.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have the fine and keen eyesight, you can make out the shape of her muscles, the definition of her efforts at self beauty.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the eyelid of her shirt will blink closed and her arms will return to her sides. END
BEGIN NOW She might as well go downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW She sure of errands and the chance of meeting a few persons both memorable and unwelcome.  END
BEGIN NOW People both accepting and tolerant.  END
BEGIN NOW But she can brush them off or paint them on.  END
BEGIN NOW They come, they go.  END
BEGIN NOW Worst case scenario, minor annoyance.  END
BEGIN NOW She digs through a pile of clothes on the floor and finds a pair of jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW She digs out a sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW She's not planning on meeting anyone she'd be embarrassed about being seen without makeup or any other sign of flagrant narcissism.  END
BEGIN NOW Nonchalant décor for the temple of her body. END
BEGIN NOW She’s moderately satisfied with the outcome in front of a full length mirror.  END
BEGIN NOW She slips on a pair of shoes in absence of socks and takes one last look before taking her purse and walking out the door. END
BEGIN NOW She locks up and coffee seems suddenly reasonable.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice stroll down town.  END
BEGIN NOW A warm cup of coffee and whatever else comes along.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee shop is one of those.  END
BEGIN NOW Full of hipsters.  END
BEGIN NOW In this story, we’re going to define a hipster as anyone that makes an effort to be cool.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever they may define cool as.  END
BEGIN NOW The most important point is that coolness must seem inherent and unintentional.  END
BEGIN NOW Like some kind of happy accident.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee isn’t bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor is it good.  END
BEGIN NOW It is coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW And it does what coffee is meant to do.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee is a conduit for warmth and stimulation. END
BEGIN NOW She stands at the counter and tries to order.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the menu and opens her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW There are no words escaping.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like a croak or a squeak.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a napkin and scrawls down “one cup of house coffee to go” and pushes the napkin towards the beverage attendant.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes the paper and somewhere between amusement and vexation returns with a steaming paper cup. END
BEGIN NOW She hands him two dollars and she takes her coffee off to the right where they keep the cream and sugar.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of both to make everything drinkable.  END
BEGIN NOW She seals it with a lid and makes her way to the door. END
BEGIN NOW In her way is a boy with no plans or direction.  END
BEGIN NOW Right in front of her is a boy familiar and foreign.  END
BEGIN NOW Absentee and native.  END
BEGIN NOW Long time gone and happy to see her.  END
BEGIN NOW They stand in front of each other for a minute like, oh hello, what are you doing here? So nice to see you and now what? END
BEGIN NOW He abandons his plans to get himself a cup.  END
BEGIN NOW To recharge his phone and write something down.  END
BEGIN NOW This is why plans are unnecessary and always get changed.  END
BEGIN NOW This is why running into people seems to be a much more organic way to deal with a day off.  END
BEGIN NOW You never really know.  END
BEGIN NOW But you can hope. END
BEGIN NOW They walk down the steps together and he asks her questions and she tries to talk only managing faint whispers.  END
BEGIN NOW He finds himself in a position where he’s expected to fill silence.  END
BEGIN NOW An altogether unfamiliar situation.  END
BEGIN NOW He tries to talk but everything comes out wrong without accompaniment.  END
BEGIN NOW Without a response to the call.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything just sounds like an unstructured list.  END
BEGIN NOW A rattling off of things that have happened recently.  END
BEGIN NOW He would have loved to hear everything she has to say.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s sure she could talk for a while and he’d be more than happy to listen.  END
BEGIN NOW She tries to use words and all she can manage are frustrating attempts at vocalization. END
BEGIN NOW She has decided that she needs a new pair of gloves and possibly a new sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW The reality of winter has dawned on her and the need for new warmth is readily apparent.  END
BEGIN NOW The go into a used clothing store.  END
BEGIN NOW She seems to know her way around, bobbing and weaving through the aisle of dusty jackets and long sleeve shirts whose only purpose now is to catch eyes at tongue in cheek parties and events meant to make the attendees think of the Seventies.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be nostalgia if anyone was even born yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead we call it retro.  END
BEGIN NOW A shout out to an era past that had definable characteristics.  END
BEGIN NOW Before originality died and left us with nothing except the remix and the mash up.  END
BEGIN NOW A razor blade and tape or a blender.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a Wednesday and there were other people in the store.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is in a hurry.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is rushing around.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW No bother.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy at her side tries his best to ramble charmingly.  END
BEGIN NOW He pauses frequently, hoping she’ll start talking.  END
BEGIN NOW He is urged to continue on.  END
BEGIN NOW He starts using his surroundings for inspiration.  END
BEGIN NOW Handing her things or holding others up for approval or rejection.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking for humor in between mauve sweaters and cardigans designed for Christmas parties at the regional center for the blind. END
BEGIN NOW They find commonality by way of mockery.  END
BEGIN NOW Shared interest in making fun of some else’s serious effort.  END
BEGIN NOW Be it a song on the radio or a jacket with altogether too many feathers and frills.  END
BEGIN NOW She decides they are done here. END
BEGIN NOW They walk a block down and turn into another store, much like the first but more modern in taste.  END
BEGIN NOW Second hand hip college age clothing for thrifty twenty-somethings.  END
BEGIN NOW The routine continues; where she shops and the boy looks around for amusement and distraction.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just tagging along.  END
BEGIN NOW No mind.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW A pleasant side track with a friend he hasn’t seen in so long.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles often and makes out something like a laugh on occasion.  END
BEGIN NOW All that really matters is time together well spent.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a white sweater.  END
BEGIN NOW Something cute and easy to throw on.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes her purchase and they leave together.  END
BEGIN NOW They walk along until the time comes to part ways.  END
BEGIN NOW She to her home and he back to the coffee shop.  END
BEGIN NOW They say goodbye and make motions to keep in touch.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks alone across a parking lot, up a hill and disappears from view.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy watches her go.  END
BEGIN NOW He wonders if should have let her get away so easily.  END
BEGIN NOW I turn the hot water facet on full, letting my hand judge temperature before adjusting with the cold.  END
BEGIN NOW I find balance and pull the lever to divert the flow to the shower head.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside steam fills the spaces between seemingly solid objects.  END
BEGIN NOW In between the soap and shampoo bottle, the loofa and razor blade.  END
BEGIN NOW I breathe the vapor in, drinking air and water, un-parching my throat.  END
BEGIN NOW I cough several times, feeling it burn in the back of my mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW I cough up a jade and chestnut colored wad of whatever that is taking up residence in the early morning aisle of my air way.  END
BEGIN NOW It's not over yet.  END
BEGIN NOW One finger presses closed each nostril in succession, I blow hard adjusting the pressure until it feels clear up there.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottom of the shower is specked with blood, mucus, snot and saliva.  END
BEGIN NOW I step to the right of the shower and let it wash down the drain, being careful to keep my feet clear.  END
BEGIN NOW I scratch at the brown bird's nest and wince; it's still sore, that sonnavabitch.  END
BEGIN NOW I can feel the puffiness of my eyes, and the sour pit in my stomach.  END
BEGIN NOW I cough again like an asthmatic cat.  END
BEGIN NOW Funny how you shake the same when you're cold.  END
BEGIN NOW You shake like everything's vibrating; a silly observation, of course.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is vibrating.  END
BEGIN NOW You're so silly sometimes, you're so fucking silly you make me sick.  END
BEGIN NOW If only you could see yourself right now, you haggard wet rodent.  END
BEGIN NOW With your little mouse face.  END
BEGIN NOW Your little mouse face with it's big stupid eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW God I hate my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Why couldn't I have Grace Kelly eyes? Would that have been too much? Is that too much to fucking ask? I cough up more mucus and look at my unsteady hand.  END
BEGIN NOW I hold the soap and loofa together with opposite hands, trying to make some sense and suds out of their pairing.  END
BEGIN NOW I wash my face, my shoulders, my left arm then my right, working from the top down.  END
BEGIN NOW Working under and over the left breast, which is slighter larger than the right.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it has something to do with dominate hands? Maybe if I were ambidextrous I'd have perfect, symmetrical tits.  END
BEGIN NOW Symmetrical would make more sense as a word if it were a palindrome.  END
BEGIN NOW That's absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW Words are absurd.  END
BEGIN NOW I wish I didn't need words anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW They just made simple things complicated.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose they made some complicated things simple too.  END
BEGIN NOW The water rinses me off and I just stand there, letting the water do what it needs to.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit in the stream, hugging my knees.  END
BEGIN NOW I rest my head on my knees, resting my big stupid eyes on my knee caps.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm still shaking.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm biting my lower lip and I can feel it shaking.  END
BEGIN NOW I can feel my teeth bouncing up and down on my lower lip.  END
BEGIN NOW They bounce unexpectedly hard during a violent shake and bite down.  END
BEGIN NOW I swear and close my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW I keep swearing in a low voice.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm running down the list of four letter words, repeating my favorites and combining the others.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm mixing and matching obscenities.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to keep doing this until I feel better.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to keeping fucking swearing until I feel better or at least numb or something else that's not this.  END
BEGIN NOW When the swearing doesn't seem to help much, I start throwing in blasphemy.  END
BEGIN NOW I can swear at God.  END
BEGIN NOW I can give God a verbal beating and berating.  END
BEGIN NOW I'll rip that shit-eating, puss-fucking, bastard-ass-dick-fuck-rat-fucking-bitch-cunt God a new cosmic asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do the same for Jesus and the saints and that whore Mary and Buddha and Shiva and Mohammad and Hare-fucking-Krishna.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know who's left any more.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know and I don't care and I don't know when I started choking on the words and coughing.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know when the water from the shower and my eyes starting running together.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know when the profanity and the blasphemy and the vulgarity started coming right back at me.  END
BEGIN NOW You stupid bitch, you stupid fucking bitch.  END
BEGIN NOW I reach out and turn the facets off; push in the lever for the shower.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit a while longer, still hugging my knees and shaking.  END
BEGIN NOW I wish I could have just found comfort in a bowl of chocolate pudding and a diet coke. END
BEGIN NOW There she is.  END
BEGIN NOW Behind the bar where she belongs.  END
BEGIN NOW In leopard print skin tight breast enhancing attire.  END
BEGIN NOW Tight black pants to match.  END
BEGIN NOW Heavy handed whiskey angel herself.  END
BEGIN NOW The setting changed since the last time.  END
BEGIN NOW From swank red plush to surfer central tiki torch cocktail party to rough and tumble biker bar.  END
BEGIN NOW It suits her somehow.  END
BEGIN NOW She is more of a twelve pack girl.  END
BEGIN NOW A Night Train on ice lady.  END
BEGIN NOW She pours bourbon and bitters into just the right size glass.  END
BEGIN NOW She prepares me, fixes me up, sets me right.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a guy in here a few nights back.  END
BEGIN NOW Frying balls on a fungus trip.  END
BEGIN NOW Thought she was divine.  END
BEGIN NOW Like an actual angel from heaven.  END
BEGIN NOW Just kept staring at her in some vain hope of salvation or redemption or something else entirely.  END
BEGIN NOW Understandable.  END
BEGIN NOW Even sober I’ve made that mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s angelic enough.  END
BEGIN NOW She could be a devil in disguise.  END
BEGIN NOW Nobody’s a hundred percent on this. END
BEGIN NOW If you were on a fist full of mushrooms, this is not the bar you’d want to be in.  END
BEGIN NOW Heavy rumble rock and roll, bright beer lights, blaring nonsense televisions.  END
BEGIN NOW If you were tripping at light speed the pretty girl behind the bar would be the only pleasant focal point for miles.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a lot of angels wear leopard print.  END
BEGIN NOW Or sport the short black bob rockabilly girl look.  END
BEGIN NOW But she pulls it off like she’s been doing it for years.  END
BEGIN NOW She probably has been.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll probably keep doing it for years to come. END
BEGIN NOW I’m double fisting a pint of water and a perfect Manhattan.  END
BEGIN NOW Guy down the bar asks for her hand in marriage.  END
BEGIN NOW He does this every night.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “I’d love to, but my minister is out of town.” She smiles all coy like and turns with a dancer’s grace to the other end of the bar, my end of the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW She throws a wink in my direction.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks over.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “Another?” to some guy with a bent body and a crooked back and a forehead facing the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy looks her up and down twice, says, “Sure.” She twists again with fluid motion, pours ice, gin and tonic into a glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Wedges a lime on the rim and stabs a straw in between the cubes.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes two napkins and puts the whole thing down on the bar at once.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “five fifty.” He reaches for his wallet and she looks over at my glasses.  END
BEGIN NOW One half empty, one half full.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes eye contact with me, then the glasses.  END
BEGIN NOW This is her way of asking me if I need another drink.  END
BEGIN NOW I wait until she can have my full attention and I can have hers.  END
BEGIN NOW I shake my head.  END
BEGIN NOW No, not right now. END
BEGIN NOW I watch her make change.  END
BEGIN NOW I watch her laugh politely at the small talk, and charming one-liners of the other patrons.  END
BEGIN NOW And I wait.  END
BEGIN NOW I watch and sip and wait.  END
BEGIN NOW I take it down to the ice and shake it like a melancholy maraca.  END
BEGIN NOW On cue, she salsas over.  END
BEGIN NOW She leans on the ice machine and tells me how silly the people on the other end of the bar are. END
BEGIN NOW One of the guys comes over.  END
BEGIN NOW Some roughneck.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a roughneck bar, after all.  END
BEGIN NOW He says, “This your boyfriend?” He motions at me. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not that lucky.” I say.  END
BEGIN NOW She laughs and glows and pours me another drink.  END
BEGIN NOW The roughneck looks at us again and says, “There’s something between you two.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t be married.  END
BEGIN NOW That ain’t how married people look at each other.” END
BEGIN NOW “Can’t get married,” I say, “that’d ruin everything.” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t get married,” he says, “only turn a good thing bad.” END
BEGIN NOW We drink in silence, watching the whiskey angel mix, pour, make change, set the taps.  END
BEGIN NOW He gives me a look, up and down.  END
BEGIN NOW Shakes his head, puts his empty bottle on the bar and leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW I light a cigarette and watch him leave.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch the girl behind the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch my glass get lighter.  END
BEGIN NOW Later on I’m going to say good night.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to pay a tab neither of us has been keeping track of.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s going to say good night.  END
BEGIN NOW And then I’m going to go home.  END
BEGIN NOW But not after a Long Kiss Goodnight. END
BEGIN NOW Long Kiss Goodnight. END

BEGIN NOW A guy washing dishes, some girl behind the counter taking orders and the burger cook.  END
BEGIN NOW The burger cook was the guy in charge when the owner wasn’t around.  END
BEGIN NOW The owner wasn’t around much and the guy on the flattop grill ran the kitchen like he missed his bus.  END
BEGIN NOW He would holler at Oskar, at the counter girl and the dishwasher.  END
BEGIN NOW Every word out of his mouth degrading, demeaning and often deranged.  END
BEGIN NOW His name was Camron.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a dick.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl behind the counter would listen to his verbal assaults on Oskar.  END
BEGIN NOW His tirades on the dishwasher.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d roll her eyes and take orders from the line of college students, lunch break business suits, and the lucky bum that managed a handful of sympathy change.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name was Dakota and she was hired to look just pretty enough in a polo shirt and a pair of jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW She wasn’t required to smile in the employee handbook.  END
BEGIN NOW A detail that never occurred to her.  END

BEGIN NOW There’s a sideways cross on his left hand.  END

BEGIN NOW He doesn’t talk much.  END
BEGIN NOW Not to Oskar, not to Camron, not to Dakota.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey chief, I needed five orders of fries yesterday.  END
BEGIN NOW What the fuck are you doing over there? Play with your dick on your own time.” END
BEGIN NOW Oskar mumbles to himself, he mumbles like, “pinche pendejo puto.  END
BEGIN NOW “ That fuckin’ Camron and his stupid burger spatula.  END
BEGIN NOW His stupid little hat.  END
BEGIN NOW His smirk.  END
BEGIN NOW The cocky little fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Like flipping burgers makes him the king of the block.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar dropped a basket of fries and felt the raindrops of black fry oil speckle his arm.  END
BEGIN NOW Que toda mierda.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar pulls the fries up from the fryer.  END
BEGIN NOW He dumps them in a four inch deep metal pan.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes a handful of salt and sprinkles it liberally over the lot.  END
BEGIN NOW He tosses everything around and divides it up between five cardboard boxes with red and white checker picnic patterns on the bottom.  END
BEGIN NOW He slaps a bell on the counter between his station and the front of the Berger Haus.  END
BEGIN NOW On cue, Dakota takes the boxes, slides them into paper bags with burgers, packets of catsup, packets of black pepper, packets of mustard, mayonnaise, and salt.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes a handful of napkins and carries all the bags to the pick-up window. END
BEGIN NOW Outside the Berger Haus are two lines of people.  END
BEGIN NOW One is waiting to order, the other is waiting to pick up.  END
BEGIN NOW In the line waiting to pick-up, waiting for a hot burger and a box of fries is a woman with a bike.  END
BEGIN NOW She has short purple hair and a messenger bag.  END
BEGIN NOW The difference is that she actually carries messages.  END
BEGIN NOW Her long muscular legs crossed on a bench, he arms folded neatly on her chest, she gets up to get a bag and bike away to a nice stairwell.  END
BEGIN NOW A perfectly cozy lunch nook.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere shaded.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW She has twenty minutes to cross town and drop off three large manila envelopes at two different office buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW She will be ten minutes early, even with a burger inside her. END
BEGIN NOW Javier is pulling two boxes of frozen burgers out of the freezer.  END
BEGIN NOW He drops the boxes at Camron’s feet and walks back to the dish pit.  END
BEGIN NOW Runs a few loads through the machine.  END
BEGIN NOW Sprays off a few trays, a few pans.  END
BEGIN NOW Watches the red brown water wash off of old patties run down the sink into the drain and down into the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Javier cracks his knuckles, pops his shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW The cross on his hand denotes that he was a weapons supplier.  END
BEGIN NOW The dots indicate his resume.  END
BEGIN NOW His biography could be summed up like cuidado, puta madre.  END
BEGIN NOW “The fuck man?” Camron is all kinds of offended.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not at all happy about the box of frozen beef dropped on his floor.  END
BEGIN NOW At his feet.  END
BEGIN NOW A backhanded favor.  END
BEGIN NOW Javier just looks at him.  END
BEGIN NOW Javier does not smile, he doesn’t shift.  END
BEGIN NOW The look on his face is as blank like a new chalk board, as hollow as a gun barrel on a starless night.  END
BEGIN NOW Camron doesn’t have a lot to say to a face like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Camron sees the ink on Javier’s neck.  END
BEGIN NOW On his sleeves, his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW He sees the tattoos and only knows a kind of primal fear.  END
BEGIN NOW He flips a burger into its own grease.  END
BEGIN NOW Camron says, “Fuck.” END
BEGIN NOW Oskar isn’t a tough guy.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just going to put that out there.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar is the kind of guy that knows trouble on the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows that shit is going to hit the fan.  END
BEGIN NOW About that time, he’ll find a way out.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll make some distance between himself and danger.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d rather not get involved.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of his madre in a rage in the back of his head.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re just like your father! Pendejo! Aye Christo.” And she would shake her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She would be so very disappointed.  END
BEGIN NOW “We’re clear.” Dakota walks through the kitchen and out to the back alley by the trashcans, the dumpster.  END
BEGIN NOW The pile of cardboard boxes.  END
BEGIN NOW She lights a menthol cigarette and sits on a milk crate.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar follows her out, rolls one up on his leg while leaning against a blue recycling bin.  END
BEGIN NOW He lights and they smoke together, not saying a word.  END
BEGIN NOW She finishes first and stubs out her smoke on the bottom of her shoe.  END
BEGIN NOW Flicks her butt over the back fence and walks back into man the register.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s really good at leaning on things and tapping buttons. END
BEGIN NOW Oskar lingers outside.  END
BEGIN NOW He blows his smoke at the mid afternoon sky.  END
BEGIN NOW His breath comes in large bursts of white cloud smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW Just when he’s feeling good about it, Camron sticks his stupid face around the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW “Get your ass back in here, holmes.” That pinche guerro.  END
BEGIN NOW There are only a few more hours in the day.  END
BEGIN NOW There are only a few more days in the year.  END
BEGIN NOW There are only a few more years left in a lifetime.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar doesn’t see this going anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, he appreciates having a job, making rent, paying his phone bill and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW But there’s got to be a better way to make a living.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar drops basket after basket of fries.  END
BEGIN NOW He seasons them, portions them out and restocks.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a routine that lets his mind wander.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanders all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Often he wanders into Dakota’s pants.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s got a boyfriend is what he heard.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t really care is also what he’s heard.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears a lot of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he thinks he would have been better conceived as nothing more than a giant ear.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a big drum for people to blah blah blah into.  END
BEGIN NOW His mind wanders to the clock and it’s already time to get out of there and thank god.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar walks home.  END
BEGIN NOW The walk takes about an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s dreamed of owning a car.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s thought about buying a bike.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s considered investing in some kind of transportation device that didn’t have laces.  END
BEGIN NOW Not once has there been any follow through.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks, maybe if I had a car I could talk to girls.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe all those smoke breaks with Dakota would turn into kisses, make out sessions, maybe even sex.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a car with a big back seat.  END
BEGIN NOW A big back seat to have sex in.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be pinche dulce. END
BEGIN NOW The living situation is like this.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s an apartment on the shitty side of town.  END
BEGIN NOW There are two guys on the lease; Oskar and his roommate, Todd.  END
BEGIN NOW Todd got a lucky break a few years back.  END
BEGIN NOW He cashed in on some internet thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Threw some inheritance money at a company that sold out to the tune of twenty million.  END
BEGIN NOW His timing was perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW He hasn’t worked a real job in his life.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s twenty eight and he’s pretty much retired.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t leave the house much.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s very determined to hold on to that money as long as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Todd spends his time taking a lot of naps.  END
BEGIN NOW He spends a lot of his time on his computer watching short videos of other people doing things. END
BEGIN NOW Oskar walks in the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He checks the mail, hangs up his keys and takes off his shoes, placing them next to the door.  END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, you’ve gotta see this shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I found this video of a guy running around with a dog in his arms.  END
BEGIN NOW Except the thing is he fed the dog cans and cans of chili.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, so much fuckin’ chili it’s ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW Then he runs around and asks people to hold his dog while he talks to them.  END
BEGIN NOW And the dog, that fuckin’ dog just blows up all over the place! Shitting chili everywhere! It’s fucking hilarious.” Todd is on the couch in a bathrobe.  END
BEGIN NOW The television is on.  END
BEGIN NOW A constant stream of science fiction movies.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t bother to look up when he talks to people.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t spend much time looking people in the eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He prefers screens.  END
BEGIN NOW “I just posted a link to it.  END
BEGIN NOW You should check it out.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll make your day.” Todd laughs to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs kind of like a zebra.  END
BEGIN NOW Kind of like horse.  END
BEGIN NOW “Maybe later, I’m fuckin’ beat.” Oskar pushes the door to his room open.  END
BEGIN NOW He falls on his bed facedown.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t move for four hours.  END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Two: A bike between the legs is worth more than a punch in the face. END
BEGIN NOW The eastside is a lovely grid.  END
BEGIN NOW This makes most of the work pretty easy.  END
BEGIN NOW Peddle and push and pump the handle bars.  END
BEGIN NOW Purple hair in the wind, the constant crank of the chain on the gears.  END
BEGIN NOW Little hills here and there are like rewards.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice downhill coast.  END
BEGIN NOW Put the bitch in cruise control.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl can dance on two wheels.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose that’s why her name was Cha Cha.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha O’Henry, courier for hire.  END
BEGIN NOW A burger in the gut will fuel your body for a few hours, give or take.  END
BEGIN NOW A box of fries will keep you going a couple more miles.  END
BEGIN NOW Homegirl is flying through the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW Her ass hardly touches the seat.  END
BEGIN NOW She shifts gears by feel, moving on and moving fast.  END
BEGIN NOW A complex of offices sits on the corner near a shopping center.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those one stop and get it all kind of places.  END
BEGIN NOW A business park, they call it.  END
BEGIN NOW There isn’t a swing set in sight.  END
BEGIN NOW Cubicles in cubes of concrete and glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes.  END
BEGIN NOW And they all sit down at desks, answering phones, directing calls, forwarding email.  END
BEGIN NOW Some are in meetings right now, talking about charts and graphs.  END
BEGIN NOW Making presentations about some money making plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to keep the company afloat until this year’s vacation.  END
BEGIN NOW This year’s staff barbeque.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha runs the maze of partitions like a mouse in a lab.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds the receptionist’s desk and drops a thick manila envelope on top.  END
BEGIN NOW “Got something for a Mister Larkin.” She says. END
BEGIN NOW “Mister Larkin is on vacation.” The receptionist says.  END
BEGIN NOW She pushes a pair of glasses up her nose with her ring finger. END
BEGIN NOW “Could you just sign for it and leave it on his desk?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose.” The receptionist takes a black ball point pen and signs her name.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes the package and drops in a pile of papers in a box labeled, “out”. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks a bunch!” And Cha Cha walks out of one office and into the elevator.  END
BEGIN NOW Does the same dance two more times and hops back on her bike.  END
BEGIN NOW Her phone rings and it’s the dispatcher.  END
BEGIN NOW His name is Clyde and he’s a voice that guides the flow of information.  END
BEGIN NOW “Pick up at the office, O’Henry.  END
BEGIN NOW Two more deliveries for the day, take it or leave it.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll take it.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks Clyde.” END
BEGIN NOW And our girl bikes off into the distance, hoping to wrap up the day by six.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinking about that cold pint of beer waiting for her on top of the bar that resides underneath her quaint studio on the south end of town.  END
BEGIN NOW That beer is going to taste amazing.  END
BEGIN NOW That beer could change her life.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha lives and dies by her watch.  END
BEGIN NOW Timing is everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Speed is valuable beyond belief.  END
BEGIN NOW In her world, a flat tire could ruin everything.  END
BEGIN NOW But for now, everything is going smoothly.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now, her day has been one A to B to another.  END
BEGIN NOW Crisscrossing town at a rapid fire rate.  END
BEGIN NOW Memorized pavement, street signs, and every short cut possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry part one: END
BEGIN NOW She’s named after a dance of Cuban origin.  END
BEGIN NOW Her father (Irish) died of a rare bone disease back in the day.  END
BEGIN NOW Her family is a mother (Cuban), one sister (older), one brother (also older), an uncle (in prison), and one grandfather (old and drunk).  END
BEGIN NOW She’s close to her mother and closer to her brother.  END
BEGIN NOW Her sister hasn’t spoken to her in years.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a college degree in art history.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s something of a stargazer.  END
BEGIN NOW She really loves coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Long walks on the beach are overrated.  END
BEGIN NOW And she’ll take a slice of pie over cake any day.  END
BEGIN NOW Her most common form of self expression is changing her hair color.  END
BEGIN NOW She considers t-shirts a valid medium for statement.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes she plays the piano, but only at the store with the baby grand that’s out of tune.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes change color between green and blue.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll tell you it changes because of the weather.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a good start.  END
BEGIN NOW Look forward to the next installment of Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry.  END
BEGIN NOW The dispatch is really a warehouse.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a desk with two phones.  END
BEGIN NOW A filing cabinet, some pallets.  END
BEGIN NOW Rows of shelving.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly the place is home to a small team of odd job enthusiasts.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a guy that hops from one classified section to another, looking for some job he’s never done before.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll lie over the phone about experience and see what happens.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a girl that bakes medicinal cookies.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a house band that only plays at house parties.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re going to make it big someday.  END
BEGIN NOW Just you wait. END
BEGIN NOW “Punch it in the face like you’re married to it!” Some guy is holding up a crash test dummy and another is wearing boxing gloves.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy wearing the gloves is bouncing back and forth on his feet.  END
BEGIN NOW He swings at the dummy, punching it left- right- left, over and over again. END
BEGIN NOW “Barbara Waxbusch was the greatest female vocalist that ever lived.” Clyde is sitting behind the desk in a rolling office chair.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls around on the bare concrete between a filing cabinet and the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulls a magazine out of one of the drawers and hands it to Cha Cha.  END
BEGIN NOW He pushes his glasses up his nose.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ever heard of her?” She shakes her head.  END
BEGIN NOW “Barbara Waxbusch was just a pseudonym.” Cha Cha looks at the magazine; on the cover is a woman dressed in black leather biker gear.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a black leather cap cocked on the side of her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s posed to look like a bad ass.  END
BEGIN NOW With heavy makeup and all the trimmings of the thing they call rock and roll.  END
BEGIN NOW “She had something of a cult following back in the late seventies.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly in upstate New York.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere around Ithaca.” Clyde shuffles two manila envelopes around on the desktop.  END
BEGIN NOW He adjusts his glasses. END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha turns to a page.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Waxbusch, leaning against a speaker.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking all sexy like.  END
BEGIN NOW The article is mostly pictures of Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Waxbusch in various poses, with various pieces of musical equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW The text is squeeze in between shots of Barbara gradually stripping down to nothing but a fancy hat and long black socks. END
BEGIN NOW “One more! C’mon Marvin, fuck this guy up!” The boxer takes a step back and using the full force of his weight, twisting his leg and torso into his shoulder into his arm into his fist into the face of the dummy.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy holding it up staggers back and falls on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW The Dummy falls right on top of him, the way an empire falls due to famine or plague.  END
BEGIN NOW The guy gets up and leaves his empire behind. END
BEGIN NOW He’s all like, “Damn Marvin.” END
BEGIN NOW And Marvin’s all like, “Yeah.” END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry closes the magazine and drops it back down on the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW “And? Is there a reason you’re telling me this?” She asks. END
BEGIN NOW “No, not really.  END
BEGIN NOW I just thought you’d be the type of person that would appreciate her music.  END
BEGIN NOW No more, no less.” He shuffles the envelopes again.  END
BEGIN NOW “Seriously, you should check her out.” END
BEGIN NOW “Awesome.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks for the hot tip.” She picks up the envelopes and looks at the addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW “How long do I have?” END
BEGIN NOW “An hour for both of them.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re not too far apart.  END
BEGIN NOW Should be a piece of cake.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah sure.  END
BEGIN NOW No problem.” Cha Cha puts the envelopes in her bag.  END
BEGIN NOW She turns to go.  END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Clyde!” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t forget, listen to some Barbara Waxbusch.” Clyde slides his glasses up his nose and runs a hand through his hair. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Three: These poles were made for dancing.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s just what they’ll do. END
BEGIN NOW The first thing that you’ll notice when you walk into the club is the air.  END
BEGIN NOW You could say that the air was heavy, seemingly smoky but not a cigar in sight.  END
BEGIN NOW The purple plush upholstery stood around in dimly lit alcoves.  END
BEGIN NOW One thing you will not notice is the gentlemen.  END
BEGIN NOW For this is a gentlemen’s club. END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the room, on a stage surrounded by chairs, there’s a pole bolted to the ceiling and the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW The pole shines gold in the spotlights.  END
BEGIN NOW The bass of the subwoofer vibrates everything in the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Paintings hang on the red velvet walls.  END
BEGIN NOW On the stage in the middle of the room a girl and a pole are doing their thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Around and around she goes.  END
BEGIN NOW Dollar bills are thrown at her feet, on the stage.  END
BEGIN NOW This one guy stacks them up in a pyramid.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound track is heavy with butt-rock, dance techno, and gangsta rap. END
BEGIN NOW The girl on the stage is a whirl of veils falling around a burnt sugar skin tone muscular legs like a tri-athlete.  END
BEGIN NOW She swims around the pole in a cycle, running a routine of desire, enticing, icing on the cake.  END
BEGIN NOW Her flesh glimmers with sweat when she drops her ass down, when she crawls across the stage towards the man with the pyramid scheme.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl tells the guy to move closer.  END
BEGIN NOW She breaths in his ear, guides his face between her tits, rubs her head in the crotch of his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW She bites his zipper and pulls away slow, burning his eyes with desire and lust.  END
BEGIN NOW The song ends and the girl picks up the dollars thrown around on the stage.  END
BEGIN NOW Crawling on her hands and knees.  END
BEGIN NOW The DJ says, END
BEGIN NOW “Give it up for Takira! Takira will be around on the floor if you liked what you saw.  END
BEGIN NOW Show her some love and buy a dance.  END
BEGIN NOW Up next is Ginny! Be sure to hit of the bar because right now is happy hour! Two for one shots of well vodka.” The DJ pushes a button that cues up a CD on a large console.  END
BEGIN NOW He lets the music take over and sits back. END
BEGIN NOW “Nice work baby.” A fat man in an expensive suit gives her a kiss as she walks off the stage.  END
BEGIN NOW She has her costume in one hand and a wad of cash in another.  END
BEGIN NOW She picks up a small lock box from the side of the stage, quickly counts the money and puts it inside.  END
BEGIN NOW Locks the box and walks backstage.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts her box in a locker with her name on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Takira slips back into her costume and wipes the sweat off her face.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a moment to sit down, spray a little perfume on.  END
BEGIN NOW Straightens her hair and make any adjustments before stepping back out on to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW As she walks out a man wearing his sunglasses approaches.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey there, nice moves.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks,” she says. END
BEGIN NOW “How about a dance? How long will 40 bucks get me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Two songs.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright,” he says, “let’s do this.” END
BEGIN NOW “Could you give me a minute? Let a girl get a drink?” She walks to the bar, not giving him time.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to get that drink before anything else.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to talk to the bartender before giving another show.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender is a woman in her thirties.  END
BEGIN NOW Used to be a dancer, now just works the drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Her makeup is heavy and her cleavage stands out of her vest like two synchronized swimmers coming up for air after the routine is all over.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a tough mother hen sweetheart with a mean penchant for sequins.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name is Sandra Clamshell but everyone around here calls her Sandy. END
BEGIN NOW “Sandy, baby, I need a shot.” Takira leans heavy on the bar top, arching her back and jutting her ass out just a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW “Still drinking bourbon?” She asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Is the sun still handing out cancer?” END
BEGIN NOW Sandy turns and grabs a glass and a bottle and pours and puts it down.  END
BEGIN NOW Takira takes the shot down and sighs big like, ahh that was nice.  END
BEGIN NOW “What’s with that guy with the glasses,” Takira asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW Never seen him around here before.” Sandy leans on the well, getting closer and quieter.  END
BEGIN NOW “He was standing in the back watching you dance.  END
BEGIN NOW Never moved.  END
BEGIN NOW Never bought a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW Kinda creepy.” END
BEGIN NOW “Huh, strange.  END
BEGIN NOW Could I get one more? I’d like to get this dance over with and get out of here.” Takira slides the glass over to Sandy’s hand.  END
BEGIN NOW “Sure thing, honey.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d like to get the hell out of here myself.” END
BEGIN NOW Takira takes down the shot, says thanks, and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks back to the dude in the sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “Still want that dance sir?” END
BEGIN NOW And he says, “Yes ma’am.” END
BEGIN NOW She turns to look at him for a second.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a goofy smile on his face, like he’s never done this before.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s got those sunglasses on despite the dim lights.  END
BEGIN NOW His hair is greasy; his nose is flat and wide.  END
BEGIN NOW He has an ugly moustache.  END
BEGIN NOW His chins prickle with stubble.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s an old coat wrapped around his body.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind you can get at the flea market or the Good Will on a bad day.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks like his name should be Chester. END
BEGIN NOW “My name is Chester,” he says, walking in the private dance room. END
BEGIN NOW “That so?” says Takira, closing the door behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW She goes right to work.  END
BEGIN NOW Walking over in time to the music she stands in front of the small couch where Chester sits.  END
BEGIN NOW She dances a little in place, just curving her body like a snake that’s been charmed.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks him up and down. END
BEGIN NOW “Franco’s pissed.” Chester sits calmly, like a lawyer.  END
BEGIN NOW “He knows about the kid.” He talks like an accountant. END
BEGIN NOW And just like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Seven words just ruined someone’s day.  END
BEGIN NOW A little someone named Takira Sunrise. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh Fuck You!” Takira looks for something to throw at Chester.  END
BEGIN NOW A vase perhaps.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe an old telephone, the kind with a rotary dial.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind that weighed a good twelve pounds.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s mad now. END
BEGIN NOW “Look lady, I’m just a messenger, alright? Don’t get all pissed off at me just because some shit just hit your fan.” Still he has his hands folded neatly in his lap.  END
BEGIN NOW “What the fuck does that bastard want with me? And I swear if he lays a finger on my fucking baby...” She gasps for breath.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at Chester like he has some kind of say in this.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not that guy.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just the fucking messenger.  END
BEGIN NOW “Woah, woah, woah.  END
BEGIN NOW Easy now.  END
BEGIN NOW No need for those kinds of theatrics.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco doesn’t want to hurt the kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the last thing he wants.  END
BEGIN NOW But Franco hates secrets, you know? Doesn’t like to be left out the picture.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit like that really pisses Franco off.  END
BEGIN NOW And when Franco get’s pissed off, someone needs to cheer him up.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone needs to do Franco a favor.” Chester pulls a tri-folded stack of papers from the inside pocket of his coat.  END
BEGIN NOW He unfolds them and hands them to Takira.  END
BEGIN NOW “Franco needs a favor or some might get hurt.” END
BEGIN NOW One of the papers is a photocopy of a photograph of the kid in question.  END
BEGIN NOW Takira’s son. END
BEGIN NOW “How did he… Oh god…” Takira looks at more of the papers.  END
BEGIN NOW There a map with markings on it.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a list of names. END
BEGIN NOW “A map and a list of names.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what you’ve got.  END
BEGIN NOW The people on this list all owe something to Franco.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d be very pleased if motions were made to expedite the process in which those persons pay Franco what they owe.” Just another day at the office for this guy.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s a hell of an office.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe you me. END
BEGIN NOW “Wait.  END
BEGIN NOW You want me to extort some people? Don’t you have like, tough guys for that shit? I mean, fuck, look at me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m like five foot two.  END
BEGIN NOW I weigh like ninety pounds.” END
BEGIN NOW “You weigh one hundred and twenty-five pounds.  END
BEGIN NOW And most of it is muscle.  END
BEGIN NOW You work out a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW We know.  END
BEGIN NOW We also know a bit more of the story.  END
BEGIN NOW A few things a working girl like yourself would tastefully leave off a resume.” Chester gets up and walks to the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns before opening the door.  END
BEGIN NOW “Figure it out.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be hearing from us.” And he closes the door behind him. END
BEGIN NOW Takira slumps over.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “Aw.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Four: On the fair banks of the olde harbor town. END
BEGIN NOW It’s hard work, being an investor.  END
BEGIN NOW At least that’s what I’ve heard.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve never had the pleasure first hand.  END
BEGIN NOW But from what I’ve seen investors do, what I’ve heard around is that investing is hard work.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like a really drawn out gambling game.  END
BEGIN NOW Say you’ve got some excess money.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s say you’re feeling a little adventurous.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s say you’re feeling like you want to be a part of something greater then yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s this company.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually a small company with some fresh new ideas and a gang of lovable losers with the skill to pull it off.  END
BEGIN NOW They just need the overhead.  END
BEGIN NOW They just need that money for things like a real printer and a copier.  END
BEGIN NOW A new computer that doesn’t crash as often as the old ones.  END
BEGIN NOW Some decent recording equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW A company car for company purposes. END
BEGIN NOW Anita Fairbanks is one of those investor types.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s sitting on a bit of money.  END
BEGIN NOW Back in the late seventies she was at the right place at the right time.  END
BEGIN NOW That bit of luck has lasted her well into right about now.  END
BEGIN NOW Right about now she’s thinking it’s time to throw that money into politics.  END
BEGIN NOW Big business.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking that boyish senator looks like a sure win.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean hell, she’d vote for him.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s comfortable enough with his politics.  END
BEGIN NOW With the way he gives speeches.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Fairbanks is a widower.  END
BEGIN NOW Her third husband died of an opiate overdose five years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW She really thought it would work out this time.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t the greatest of men, nor the worst.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a kind heart and a way with words.  END
BEGIN NOW Part time philanthropist, part time womanizer, part time junkie.  END
BEGIN NOW Said he couldn’t help himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Those addictions were just too good.  END
BEGIN NOW Too hard to let go of.  END
BEGIN NOW Then too much to handle.  END
BEGIN NOW Anita is the Spanish form of Anne.  END
BEGIN NOW Anne means favor or grace.  END
BEGIN NOW A graceful little favor.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose that’s exactly what she was up to.  END
BEGIN NOW Providing graceful little favors to politicians.  END
BEGIN NOW Keeping the campaign afloat.  END
BEGIN NOW Floating like the boats out in the old harbor. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a boat out there with her name on it.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s painted in green.  END
BEGIN NOW A flowing freehand script.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Even in the fog.  END
BEGIN NOW The sky in the old harbor town is a blend of grays.  END
BEGIN NOW The clouds are well layered here.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a cake made from humidity and depression.  END
BEGIN NOW The rain comes and goes and comes back again to hang around.  END
BEGIN NOW The rain keeps making excuses to stop by.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, oh I seem to have left my glasses over, could I swing by and pick them up? I’ll only be a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Or, do you have a good hat I could borrow? See, there’s this thing tonight and I really need a hat to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Without a hat, I’d just look silly. END
BEGIN NOW Anita takes a pack of slim 100s.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits on the deck of her quaint little house by its cozy little harbor town.  END
BEGIN NOW She lights a long thin cigarette and lets her eyelids down a few degrees.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs and looks out at the harbor.  END
BEGIN NOW The sail boats and schooners.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple of yachts.  END
BEGIN NOW A yacht club with matching weather stained wood siding.  END
BEGIN NOW Woodpecker Swiss cheese telephone poles and rusted cars.  END
BEGIN NOW It was such a nice, quiet town.  END
BEGIN NOW Anita moved north when the city started to destroy her.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a reputation, she was considered privileged.  END
BEGIN NOW The way was paved for party all the time- push- shove-push it harder all the time and never a break just going and running wild with every turn burning down in little spoons and soon shall be injected into the flesh to the bone to heart to the head the brain and blood stream and then… END
BEGIN NOW Anita drags on her cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Just drags and drags.  END
BEGIN NOW The wrinkles in her fingers and the wrinkles in her face the lines of worry on her eyebrows and bloodshot eyeballs the shakes.  END
BEGIN NOW The fucking shakes again.  END
BEGIN NOW Anita drags on her cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW She flicks and shakes and drags on her cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW A little stream of ashes falling like Pompeii snowflakes on to the weather stained deck attached to the quaint little harbor town home. END
BEGIN NOW Her half brother lives down south.  END
BEGIN NOW In the thick city.  END
BEGIN NOW The city where the noise and the speed, the lights and sounds all collide and amplify, echoing on and on and on.  END
BEGIN NOW She can’t really go back to that city.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d rather not go back to any city.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not that she’s old.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks and feels older than she is.  END
BEGIN NOW But she’s been there and done that and knows there’s nothing but trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW Her son’s down there too.  END
BEGIN NOW Down there with her half brother.  END
BEGIN NOW Right in the thick of it. END
BEGIN NOW That poor little bastard, she thinks rolling the butt of her now extinguished, now put out, now nothing but a filter from a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Her poor bastard son.  END
BEGIN NOW She tried.  END
BEGIN NOW There were schools and teachers and priests and pastors, after school activity clubs and sports teams.  END
BEGIN NOW Every distraction from the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW From making those kinds of friends.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones that get into to trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind that have a roll of money all to themselves. END
BEGIN NOW It didn’t take long.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that long at all, really.  END
BEGIN NOW First there were the detentions, the suspensions.  END
BEGIN NOW Parent teacher conferences, school transfers, attendance records.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no stopping him once he got started.  END
BEGIN NOW Pretty soon he just stopped coming home unless he was hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless sales were down.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless he just wanted an excuse to show up and let his mom know he wasn’t dead yet.  END
BEGIN NOW She never done him wrong and he knew that.  END
BEGIN NOW She wasn’t around much either.  END
BEGIN NOW She had things to do and people to see and parties to go to.  END
BEGIN NOW And the boy’s father.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, let’s just say he was before husband number one.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t bother to keep in touch.  END
BEGIN NOW He just kinda, disappeared.  END
BEGIN NOW Step dad number one was a whole big barrel of fun and old money.  END
BEGIN NOW He just paid for everything, that big fat beautiful man.  END
BEGIN NOW Took to looking after Anita.  END
BEGIN NOW Making sure she had a nice dress to wear.  END
BEGIN NOW Made sure she had her fill of little shrimp cocktails with plenty of Heinz 57.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the fat fuck had to go and have a stroke.  END
BEGIN NOW Just broke Anita’s little heart.  END
BEGIN NOW She couldn’t very well stay married to a half man half vegetable.  END
BEGIN NOW He was just so needy and useless after that.  END
BEGIN NOW Anita wasn’t a caregiver.  END
BEGIN NOW Was never in her blood.  END
BEGIN NOW Her mom didn’t baby her, she didn’t baby nobody neither.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t a bad thing, exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, that’s a good way to learn a few keys to survival.  END
BEGIN NOW You ain’t got nobody but you, babe.  END
BEGIN NOW Better learn to live with yourself and make the most of things.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a human being just like the rest of us.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop making excuses and do something about it.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s your gift as a human.  END
BEGIN NOW That magical quality that put you at the top of the food chain.  END
BEGIN NOW The divorce was finalized and Anita didn’t get much of anything in the settlement.  END
BEGIN NOW Time to start over again.  END
BEGIN NOW So she packed up and headed west.  END
BEGIN NOW The land of sunshine and opportunity.  END
BEGIN NOW To some exciting new career in something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW Onward, to destiny. END
BEGIN NOW Destiny came in the form of a lawyer all to herself.  END
BEGIN NOW The man was handsome and well connected.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t a court lawyer like they have on the television.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a company lawyer, the kind that draws up papers for one company to merge with another company.  END
BEGIN NOW A mergers and acquisitions kind of guy.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of guy that would take you out for a nice steak on the weekend.  END
BEGIN NOW Take you out to the rock and roll clubs at night.  END
BEGIN NOW Take off your shoes for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Take a line of coke off your cleavage.  END
BEGIN NOW Destiny gave Anita Fairbanks the best sex of her life. END
BEGIN NOW And of course he cheated on her.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she cheated on him.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they got married and had more sex behind each other’s back then they would together in the same room.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes when you get good at something you just have to see how much better you can get.  END
BEGIN NOW Now you’re curious.  END
BEGIN NOW Now you’re wondering, how much farther I can take this.  END
BEGIN NOW Where can this road go except up? And what do you mean there’s a top to this hill we’re climbing.  END
BEGIN NOW What’d you mean there’s a cliff on the other side? END
BEGIN NOW This time the divorce was really messy.  END
BEGIN NOW There were TV crews and radio reporters and newspaper men.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a lot of publicity and tabloids.  END
BEGIN NOW It was the worst month of either of their lives.  END
BEGIN NOW It was the kind of thing that could only happen in a town like Hollywood or Miami.  END
BEGIN NOW That left Anita with a reputation and a track record.  END
BEGIN NOW She was the talk of the town for days.  END
BEGIN NOW She had to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW She needed her space.  END
BEGIN NOW This? This just wasn’t working out. END
BEGIN NOW North bound and she bought a coat and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Swore off men and marriage and left her kid behind in the city he called home to fend for himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like he’d been doing all along.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Fairbanks went up north.  END
BEGIN NOW She found a nice little harbor town with a quaint little dock.  END
BEGIN NOW She found a kind older gentleman that owned a sturdy old yacht.  END
BEGIN NOW She changed her named to Anita and planned on settling down.  END
BEGIN NOW She planned on getting used to the cold weather and the clouds and the sweet older gentleman that would bring her flowers that he cut out of the neighbor’s garden in the morning before they woke up.  END
BEGIN NOW She even liked the sound of her new name.  END
BEGIN NOW Anita Fairbanks has a much more pleasant ring to it than Barbara Waxbusch. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Five:  The Grease Trap. END
BEGIN NOW In the floor of every restaurant with a fryer, in every restaurant with a lot of oil waste, there’s a grease trap.  END
BEGIN NOW The grease trap filters out the solid chucks of solidified fat and oil that make their way down the drain.  END
BEGIN NOW They come in a variety of shapes and sizes.  END
BEGIN NOW They need a good pumping from a rooter service every once in a while.  END
BEGIN NOW What happens if the trap doesn’t get pumped? All that shitty water from leftover food, old grease, and ancient burger fat comes up and out of the trap.  END
BEGIN NOW It seeps and soaks the floors, right through cardboard boxes.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a health issue, a safety issue and it’s just plain disgusting.  END
BEGIN NOW When the grease trap overflows the place might have to shut down until the plumber can be called to suck the whole mess into a giant vacuum that connected to a big truck with a tank in the back.  END
BEGIN NOW A tank holding all those things that went down the drain and caused a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW This is exactly what happened around lunch at the Berger Haus where Oskar was dropping frozen French fries into old black oil. END
BEGIN NOW Around his feet this puddle began forming.  END
BEGIN NOW A smell like decay and death and the motor oil found in a fermented junk yard somewhere in the bowels of the Midwest.  END
BEGIN NOW “Aw shit! Fuckin’ shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Not again.  END
BEGIN NOW Puta madre!” Oskar lifts his feet up.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s tip toeing around the sewage spewing up from the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the bog exacting its revenge. END
BEGIN NOW “Would someone please call the fucking plumber? Dakota!” Oskar has moved out of the way.  END
BEGIN NOW Javier turns to watch.  END
BEGIN NOW He leans on the dish washer and spits in the sink.  END
BEGIN NOW Folds his arms across his chest and watches Oskar avoid the grease.  END
BEGIN NOW Camron is all ready for this situation. END
BEGIN NOW “Goddamnit Oskar! What the hell did you do this time? Have you been forgetting to close the drains in the fryers again? Did you spill a shit ton last time you changed the oil?” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck man, no.  END
BEGIN NOW It just won’t fucking stop!” Oskar is standing by the freezer door, watching his station slowly flood with black brown swamp grease.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh god, this shit is fucking disgusting.” END
BEGIN NOW Oskar does what comes naturally and goes out the back door.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls a cigarette and looks up.  END
BEGIN NOW Dakota is already on the phone to the plumber.  END
BEGIN NOW She says it’ll be an hour at least before he has time to stop by.  END
BEGIN NOW This is not looking good for Oskar. END
BEGIN NOW “Are you done smoking yet, you filthy fuck? Get some goddamn towels and old linens and get them on the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t have time to cry about this.  END
BEGIN NOW I need four orders of fries.  END
BEGIN NOW And I need them right fucking now.” Camron flips a few burgers around on the grill.  END
BEGIN NOW He slides the partially frozen beef patties around on the flat top and takes a few buns and lays them cut side down on a dry spot.  END
BEGIN NOW He toasts the buns and slides the burgers on top.  END
BEGIN NOW He puts the whole thing in a little paper tray and throws it in the window so that the box slides down to Dakota.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar sweats and kicks around a pile of greasy rags, old moldy aprons making a nest on the floor around the fryers. END
BEGIN NOW This is going to be a long, stupid day. END
BEGIN NOW Quitting time came exactly five years, seven months, two weeks, four days and seven hours later.  END
BEGIN NOW Before that day at work was over two presidents were elected, Oskar’s childhood friends were all married and had multiple children, and his mother grew older and crazier.  END
BEGIN NOW The environment got hotter and cancer was cured.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar was not happy about the cure for cancer.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar was still pissed off about the grease trap.  END
BEGIN NOW He walked home under the street lights.  END
BEGIN NOW He kicked at the shit in the street and swore out loud when no one was around to hear him.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he thought as much. END
BEGIN NOW On a bus bench near the corner store under a particular shade of street light was a mighty black man.  END
BEGIN NOW His pigment was as dark as sin and stronger than a real cup of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW His hat might have been older than he was.  END
BEGIN NOW He had fingers thick like slabs of bacon in a time when the pigs ate well and the pigs were fat and happy.  END
BEGIN NOW His clothes were faded like the ending of a sad movie.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a guitar case sitting next to him.  END
BEGIN NOW The hard kind.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind where it was hard to tell if that was leather or alligator skin.  END
BEGIN NOW The old black man he says, “’ey Boy.  END
BEGIN NOW Look he’re.  END
BEGIN NOW Look he’re.” END
BEGIN NOW And Oskar was dumb enough to stop and listen. END
BEGIN NOW “Boy you look like a woman got to you.” And that old black man he laughs.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs like Thanksgiving and Christmas were having a party to celebrate St.  END
BEGIN NOW Patrick’s birthday.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs until next summer then starts on again. END
BEGIN NOW “Now lemme tell ya somethin’.  END
BEGIN NOW Real quick like.  END
BEGIN NOW Lemme lay a little story on you.  END
BEGIN NOW Say Boy, you got a quarter?” And the black man shuts up and looks at Oskar for a second.  END
BEGIN NOW “Stories gonna costa quarter from ya.” END
BEGIN NOW And Oskar reaches into his pocket and finds a quarter.  END
BEGIN NOW It must be his lucky fucking day.  END
BEGIN NOW He hands the quarter over. END
BEGIN NOW Black man goes, “lemme buy a cigarette off you for a quarter.”  END
BEGIN NOW This gets Oskar to smile a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW That was almost witty.  END
BEGIN NOW He kinda liked the guy at the moment.  END
BEGIN NOW Oskar takes out his pouch of tobacco and rolls a cigarette for the man with the guitar at the bus stop.  END
BEGIN NOW The black man says, “Thanks Boy.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s some mighty shitty tobacco you got there.” This time he only laughs until solstice.  END
BEGIN NOW “Now about that story… END
BEGIN NOW Now back in the day there was all kinds of nutty folk out there.  END
BEGIN NOW Not nutty like you and I, Boy.  END
BEGIN NOW Nutty like the way cookies can be or what’s that shit that hippies eat? Granola.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit is horrible.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, so there’s this dude and his chick and they get all married and have a kid and the kid is alright for a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the dude gets disinterested in his wife, fools around with her friends and gets one of them all with a kid too.  END
BEGIN NOW Now the dude has two sons by two different women.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes one under his wing and just sort of leaves the ma and the boy to fend for themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Which ain’t so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW They do aight.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘Cept the thing is, dude’s kinduva big shot.  END
BEGIN NOW Has a buncha land n’ shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Now he’s got two sons and they’re entitled to the land and what not when he dies.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s already a pretty old dude right? So his favored son, the one he kept gets it in his head to go out to sea.  END
BEGIN NOW See the world, right? Wouldn’t you know it but the son got pushed overboard.  END
BEGIN NOW Never heard from again.  END
BEGIN NOW Declared dead.  END
BEGIN NOW Dude goes all into a depression, affects his health.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s all messed up.  END
BEGIN NOW Doesn’t know where his sons are.  END
BEGIN NOW Old and dying and got no more kids to take over the family business.  END
BEGIN NOW So being the big shot that he is, he holds some try outs.  END
BEGIN NOW Figures he can recruit just as well as procreate.  END
BEGIN NOW Figures the rightful heir will turn up sometime and claim his shit.  END
BEGIN NOW But here’s the twist.  END
BEGIN NOW The bastard son’s ma dies of some disease.  END
BEGIN NOW Kid never knows his dad’s loaded.  END
BEGIN NOW Never knows he’s supposed to inherit the good life.  END
BEGIN NOW Ends up living with his uncle on his ma’s side of the family.  END
BEGIN NOW And this uncle guy, he’s a real piece of work.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes the boy do all sorts of nasty chores.  END
BEGIN NOW Cleaning up horse shit, caring for the animals on the farm.  END
BEGIN NOW Slave work. END
BEGIN NOW You hear me Boy? Slave work! Hey! Look he’re! END
BEGIN NOW So the uncle being the opportunist that he is thinks he’ll go for this tryout thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinks maybe this is his lucky break.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes the kid along to be his lil’ servant.  END
BEGIN NOW Clean up his horse shit.  END
BEGIN NOW That kind of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW So this tryout business is like a fight, right? Buncha guys all riled up.  END
BEGIN NOW Battling for the fortune.  END
BEGIN NOW And well shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I must be boring the hell out of you.  END
BEGIN NOW Boy you look lost. END
BEGIN NOW And Oskar breaks his trance and looks at the black man on the bus stop with his guitar case and he’s no longer smoking that rolled cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Just looking at Oskar. END
BEGIN NOW “An ol’ nigga like me can go on f’hours.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll finish the story next time you come round.  END
BEGIN NOW And next time you come ‘round, maybe you bring me a little something to sip on.  END
BEGIN NOW Brandy is nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Little brandy goes a long way.” And the old black man laughs from Halloween until Valentine’s Day. END
BEGIN NOW “Run along, Boy.  END
BEGIN NOW And don’t let them women getcha down like that.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s plenty of time for that when you’re my age.”   END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Six: The Prologue. END
BEGIN NOW Earthquakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Fire.  END
BEGIN NOW Famine.  END
BEGIN NOW Plagues, they call ‘em.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there’s flooding.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there are weird sicknesses.  END
BEGIN NOW Influenzas or something.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I like that word.  END
BEGIN NOW Influenza.  END
BEGIN NOW It just sounds so sexy when you say it.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be the name of some hot chick.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be the name of a sexy dance.  END
BEGIN NOW So here’s the setting.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re at this farm, somewhere in the middle of fuck, USA.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s some old farmer dude and his livestock.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a bunch of immigrant workers in the fields, picking, weeding, harvesting, and dealing with whatever it is that he’s growing in there. END
BEGIN NOW Farmer dude’s all like, “yep” and “mhmm” all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Spends a lot of time in the sun, has rough wrinkled leather skin like a lizard in a good farmers hat and blue jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW The farmer dude is a stocky dude.  END
BEGIN NOW He likes to watch his cows out there in the fields.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t like to watch the laborers.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so much.  END
BEGIN NOW He watched the cows chew grass and lay around.  END
BEGIN NOW He watched them swat at flies with their tails.  END
BEGIN NOW The cows are walking around all slow like.  END
BEGIN NOW Their balls are swinging underneath them like twin grandfather clocks made from skin.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside the balls of these cows something strange began to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it was dietary.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it was something in the water.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe god came down from heaven on a little red wagon and kicked a cow in the balls before flying off to deliver presents to little children all over the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Things you should know about me and cow balls: END
BEGIN NOW I firmly believe that bull testicles are fucking delicious.  END
BEGIN NOW The texture is like scallops.  END
BEGIN NOW Big beefy fucking scallops.  END
BEGIN NOW Seared or grilled, well marinated or straight up oil salt and pepper.  END
BEGIN NOW I have dreams about cow balls.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they keep me up at night.  END
BEGIN NOW Little nuggets of magic.  END
BEGIN NOW I think everyone should eat balls whenever the opportunity presents its self. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I start talking about balls I lose track of whatever else I was going on about.  END
BEGIN NOW I would apologize, but I wouldn’t mean it anyway. END
BEGIN NOW Also it should be noted that the balls of these particular cows were chalk full of fungus.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, I’m not talking about the good kind of fungus.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind that feed you or fuck you up or make everything better again.  END
BEGIN NOW This kind of fungus was the kind that had some kind of relationship the cow balls.  END
BEGIN NOW A bad relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW A destructive and violent relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW The cow balls needed counseling.  END
BEGIN NOW Think of me as a testicular counselor.  END
BEGIN NOW A hope for the future.  END
BEGIN NOW A future full of balls. END
BEGIN NOW The old farmer dude looks at the cows and scratches his own balls.  END
BEGIN NOW The future is full of balls. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Seven:  It takes two to tango but only one to Cha Cha END
BEGIN NOW See a blaze of purple hair in the wind on a neck on a backbone on a bike plowing the hillsides like a streamlined bead of sweat rolling down the face of America.  END
BEGIN NOW Right after America’s morning jog around the world.  END
BEGIN NOW See a girl with a bag at her side, snug on her torso, strapped in for the ride.  END
BEGIN NOW See Cha Cha O’Henry fly over concrete seams and sidewalk cracks.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch as she bobs and weaves through traffic like a paper boat in the run-off from a recent rain.  END
BEGIN NOW Deliveries done, work over, off the clock and time to sit back, set back, and unwind the wind from her short, cropped, purple like a head of cabbage hair.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls up her bicycle to the side of a bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Her apartment is right upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Apartment number two.  END
BEGIN NOW Right above the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Now the bar should have a few words.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a few to sort of sum up what and who the bar is and why it’s there.  END
BEGIN NOW The significance of the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Which really, isn’t all that significant at all.  END
BEGIN NOW In fact, the bar will have no say in this.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar was a dive joint with a lot of wood on the inside and concrete on the outside.  END
BEGIN NOW That is to say, a rough, weather worn exterior, a warm cozy, messy like its well lived in interior.  END
BEGIN NOW You might like this bar, you might hate this bar.  END
BEGIN NOW But the bar will neither acknowledge your feelings nor give a rat’s ass about them.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar will continue getting people drunk and kicking them out.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar will continue being loud.  END
BEGIN NOW Glass will keep breaking inside.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of pool balls hitting pool balls, the sound of loud people talking in a slurry.  END
BEGIN NOW An erratic soundtrack of whatever the fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t a bad bar, it wasn’t a good bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha locks her bike up outside. END
BEGIN NOW She walks up the steps and unlocks the door and throws her bag down and sits on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits down and works her shoes using one foot against the other.  END
BEGIN NOW She lies down.  END
BEGIN NOW She breathes.  END
BEGIN NOW She closes her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Her day now done for obligations and work and whatnot.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking about a nap and a shower and a drink sometime soon.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking about it.  END
BEGIN NOW And for right now, that’ll do. END
BEGIN NOW Things you should know about Cha Cha O’Henry’s Apartment. END
BEGIN NOW When she got the place the rent was cheap and she liked the bar enough and everything just kind of fell into place.  END
BEGIN NOW The inside is decorated with stolen signs, artifacts, remnants of her life.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha likes order and disorder in equal parts.  END
BEGIN NOW Half the time, everything is clean.  END
BEGIN NOW The other half of the time, it’s not.  END
BEGIN NOW Her furniture consists of a small table, a two seated couch (some folks call those love seats.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess two seats is an intimate insinuation.  END
BEGIN NOW In this case it was practical.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a small apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I should have mentioned that earlier.  END
BEGIN NOW So go back a few steps and pretend you’ve never seen the place.) Alright, now we open the door to apartment two and it’s a very small apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s an array of paintings, posters, photographs, flyers, and odd things on the walls.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a small circle of shag rug, right in the middle of the room.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a small radio on a small windowsill next to a little potted plant.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a miniature chair with a tiny desk.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this is ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha O’Henry is a pretty small girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She fits right in there.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all you should know about her apartment. END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha took a whole paragraph of time to take a nice hot shower.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s toweled off and clothed.  END
BEGIN NOW Her beet juice hair is all wet still and drops drip, darkening and dampening her clothes as she walks around the place looking for her comfy shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW In case you were wondering, she’s more a t-shirt and jeans kinda girl.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s like, pretty standard you know.  END
BEGIN NOW “I know right!” voices from down below seep into the hardwood floor and up they go into Cha Cha’s ear drums.  END
BEGIN NOW “He’s like sooo into you!” Patio seating out back.  END
BEGIN NOW It just drifts right in with the smoke and the lights.  END
BEGIN NOW The thumping of a bass on the weekends.  END
BEGIN NOW You get used to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha goes down the stairs and into the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW She found her comfy shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Now she could use a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice shiny drink, all to herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking a cold, cheap beer and a shot of whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like magic right there.  END
BEGIN NOW Something special.  END
BEGIN NOW A very special thing. END
BEGIN NOW She sits down at the bar and behind the bar is a woman in her early thirties.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s built like she belongs on the hood of a car magazine.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s built like an S, like the first letter in she, sexy, saucy, and satisfaction.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the first letter in silence, in solace, in soft and supple.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands all arms akimbo, smiles at Cha Cha and says something so simple.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, END
BEGIN NOW “Well?” END
BEGIN NOW And Cha Cha says, END
BEGIN NOW “I need a special.  END
BEGIN NOW Please.” END
BEGIN NOW And the woman behind the bar pours the shot and cracks open a cold can of beer.  END
BEGIN NOW She sets it down on the bar and Cha Cha hands her a five dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha puts two dollars in tip on top of the bar and drinks the shot.  END
BEGIN NOW  No hesitation, no waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW Just downs it and takes a drink off the beer can.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha goes, END
BEGIN NOW Aaaahhhhh END
BEGIN NOW She does it like a leaf free falling from the top of a tree when the autumn winds start blowing and the leaf is all like, my job is done here! And he flies off into the street on to sidewalk and into a drainage ditch and down the drain and into the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha sighs like nature on a pension plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the whole ocean hitting fifty-five and finally retiring.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha sighs a sing-song senior citizen’s discount with a shopping cart full of groceries. END
BEGIN NOW Down the stools, across the long wood bar are two guys watching the baseball game, muted on a corner television.  END
BEGIN NOW The guys are somewhere between twenty or thirty.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Old enough to drink beer and watch baseball.  END
BEGIN NOW The game goes on and takes days for anyone to make a move.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice slow ball game for some slow beer drinking guys.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of thing most people like at the end of a long day. END
BEGIN NOW There’s this painting on the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a nice painting.  END
BEGIN NOW A little stream and some trees.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all peaceful like.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the most peaceful looking thing in a two mile radius.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s this tray of drink condiments on the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW A little tray with maraschino cherries and wedges of citrus fruits.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a small pile of olives in a little olive dish.  END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha pops an olive in her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She chews it nice and slow. END
BEGIN NOW “CATFISH!” A voice calls out.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice is huge.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice behind the catfish would take up three city blocks and carry them across town.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice could stop traffic, stop motion, stop everything.  END
BEGIN NOW That voice could stare the hole in the O Zone down and say, “HEY! CUT THAT SHIT OUT!” and the O Zone would be like, “oh man, I’m sorry man.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t mean it.”  END
BEGIN NOW A man only slightly smaller than his voice walks.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing an apron and a very utilitarian hat.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears the hat because he’s bald.  END
BEGIN NOW Without that hat, his head would be very cold. END
BEGIN NOW The woman behind the bar says, END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Nat, what’s cookin’?” END
BEGIN NOW And Nat says, END
BEGIN NOW “CATFISH!” He walks behind the bar and grabs a tall can of beer.  END
BEGIN NOW He cracks the beer and in once swift motion, downs at least half of it.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks out back to his grill and once more with feeling he says, END
BEGIN NOW “CAAATFISH!” After he leaves there’s enough room in the bar for three competing marching bands, a parade and a kettle of fish. END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha eats another olive.  END
BEGIN NOW She turns towards the television but doesn’t pay too much attention to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a reflex.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a moth to the front porch light at an apartment on the wrong side of town. END
BEGIN NOW In an apartment on the wrong side of town, in a bed in a room there’s Oskar.  END
BEGIN NOW Tired, beaten Oskar.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls over on his back and stares at the ceiling.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the ceiling the way a woman once stared at a piece of toast until the Mother of god came down and rubbed her burnt face right on it.  END
BEGIN NOW And just like I would have done were I that woman with the piece of toast, Oskar decided right then and there that he needed a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice strong, shiny drink.  END
BEGIN NOW All to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Right at very moment, Cha Cha flags down the woman behind the bar and says, END
BEGIN NOW “Could I get another special, when you have time? Please.” She asks very nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Eight: in which I’m not yet convinced I have ignored the plot enough yet. END
BEGIN NOW Balls.  END
BEGIN NOW Big ol’ swingin’ cow balls.  END
BEGIN NOW All those bulls.  END
BEGIN NOW Out standing in the field.  END
BEGIN NOW If you had some kind of crazy telescope/microscope x-ray machine you could zoom right in on those balls.  END
BEGIN NOW You could check out the nonsense under the hood.  END
BEGIN NOW See what’s going on down there. END
BEGIN NOW Things you will not find in and slash or on a field full of cow balls: END
BEGIN NOW A circus. END
BEGIN NOW The Warsaw Philharmonic. END
BEGIN NOW A gunslinger challenging the sheriff to a duel. END
BEGIN NOW A chess board with all the pieces. END
BEGIN NOW A hot cup of coffee. END
BEGIN NOW A paperback copy of the Constitution of the United States. END
BEGIN NOW You will find all kinds of shit though.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be shit on the balls, shit in the balls.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit around the balls.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit will circumnavigate the cow and the cow’s balls as long as there are cows and balls and shit to be around.  END
BEGIN NOW The external shit isn’t the problem right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now, the shit inside is causing a maddening itch.  END
BEGIN NOW If there’s one great thing that I am glad about not being a cow, it would have to be the ability to scratch my balls with an appendage well suited for the task.  END
BEGIN NOW A cow’s hoof won’t scratch balls with any sort of efficiency.  END
BEGIN NOW More so, a hoof would just kind of slap at the sack of cow balls swinging liberally between the cow legs like a lindy hopper that’s been spun out on sugar and steroids during the entirety of spring training.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, I don’t know about you, but if a hoof slapped my balls, I could only be very unhappy about it.  END
BEGIN NOW I would be hurt and sad and angry then I’d feel sick and throw up all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be a nobody wins kind of situation. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the testicles of these bovine some silly virus is trying to divide by zero.  END
BEGIN NOW The cows will start getting upset.  END
BEGIN NOW First only a little, then very much so.  END
BEGIN NOW Those fucking cows will lose their goddamned minds.  END
BEGIN NOW Try an experiment to better understand the cow mentality.  END
BEGIN NOW Go find a nice field of grass and stand around it all day wearing nothing but boxing gloves loaded with weights on your hands and feet.  END
BEGIN NOW Roll your balls around in the field, get them good and acclimated.  END
BEGIN NOW Now wait until the itching starts.  END
BEGIN NOW And just try.  END
BEGIN NOW Just try and deal with it.  END
BEGIN NOW See how many times you smack yourself in the junk and the itching won’t stop.  END
BEGIN NOW Count if you can, on a scale of one to ten, how nuts that starts to drive you.  END
BEGIN NOW  Now picture yourself a few tons heavier.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple hundred pounds of ungraceful muscle and fat.  END
BEGIN NOW Try to dance your way out of that one. END
BEGIN NOW I bet you thought you were pretty clever.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet you though you could scratch your own balls. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Nine:  Brown Eyed Women and Red Grenadine. END
BEGIN NOW The shift is over.  END
BEGIN NOW The night is being swept into the dust pan called closing time.  END
BEGIN NOW The strobe lights are off.  END
BEGIN NOW The spot lights are down.  END
BEGIN NOW The floor lights are up and at the bar is a row of photogenic, picture perfect, could be perfect porn stars.  END
BEGIN NOW They sit in miniskirts that are more like belts.  END
BEGIN NOW They sit in shorts and panties and blue jeans and sweat pants and hot pants.  END
BEGIN NOW Like ducks in a row.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them are drinking vodka, some are drinking water.  END
BEGIN NOW A few are drinking whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ve broken off into little pockets of conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, END
BEGIN NOW “Where did you get those boots?” END
BEGIN NOW “I love your hair! It’s so pretty.” END
BEGIN NOW You’d probably think they all like each other very much.  END
BEGIN NOW You might think that every night is like girls night out.  END
BEGIN NOW You are blind between the lines.  END
BEGIN NOW You are all kinds of wrong about it.  END
BEGIN NOW The air is competitive.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a pretty ruthless game they play here.  END
BEGIN NOW Take lacrosse and add a few more balls in there.  END
BEGIN NOW Take out the sticks and put in poles, remove the ref and throw in a bouncer.  END
BEGIN NOW Replace the scoreboard with a money box. END
BEGIN NOW Above the bar where they all sit and talk amongst themselves is a neon pink flamingo of a sign spelling out in sexy cursive script, “The Daisy Chain”.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a nice sign.  END
BEGIN NOW The sign will make you think of Florida.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll find the connection odd and completely expected.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll just feel right.  END
BEGIN NOW Back down at the bar there’s a show going on.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a show of subtlety and insult.  END
BEGIN NOW The girls with the bigger tits will do terrible things so that no one forgets about the fat sacks stapled to her chest.  END
BEGIN NOW Little arm motions to set the skin to movement.  END
BEGIN NOW A brush off of the hair in the face leading to a well racked display of what happens to Jell-O molds at housewarming parties during earthquakes. END
BEGIN NOW The words will be nice, but no one’s really listening.  END
BEGIN NOW The rivalries and disputes will carry on underneath all those letters.  END
BEGIN NOW Each girl is there for one reason.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s a reason called rent.  END
BEGIN NOW There are a lot of strippers in the world and each one is fighting off the rest of ‘em for a couple of bucks for five minutes of your time and the all too brief occupation of your lap.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey what was with that one guy?” A girl drinking something girly asks between straws. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know but he creeped me out.” Another girl that’s already in civilian attire answers. END
BEGIN NOW “He was hella weird.” This time it’s the bartender.  END
BEGIN NOW The one whose tits have been gasping for air all night. END
BEGIN NOW “He sent Takira out of here in a state.” Says another girl. END
BEGIN NOW “Mhmm.” Replies someone else. END
BEGIN NOW There’s this bouncer dude in a smart suit standing around all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s in one place as much as any other.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s like your average ex-military tuff guy.  END
BEGIN NOW All cast iron barrel chest from the belt to the face.  END
BEGIN NOW All work horse legs and thunder clap thighs from the belt down.  END
BEGIN NOW And yeah, those are probably steel tipped black boots custom made to stomp any motherfucker that tries any funny business in a place like this.  END
BEGIN NOW Leave the funny business to the comedians.  END
BEGIN NOW The comedy club is down the street. END
BEGIN NOW Down the street and a few over behind the wheel of an off green hatchback is that girl named Takira Sunrise.  END
BEGIN NOW The bad news is there’s a guy named Franco and he’s got her number.  END
BEGIN NOW The good news is that exactly eleven minutes ago, Takira picked up smoking again after a five year hiatus.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s already smoked three down to the filter.  END
BEGIN NOW She just parked the car and thought and smoked and thought some more.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking is the best way to get some thinking done.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost as good as a hot shower.  END
BEGIN NOW If there was a way to smoke cigarettes in a hot shower while getting the full effect of both, we’d all be prunes by now. END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the photograph again and again and again.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at her boy there in the picture, oblivious, child like.  END
BEGIN NOW And to think she was so happy that he never had a chance to meet his father.  END
BEGIN NOW She was so happy to leave that behind and get the hell out while the getting was good.  END
BEGIN NOW The umbilical cord of the past was just dragging behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting to spring back like a neglected Slinky caught on the stairs of a great escape. END
BEGIN NOW She flicks a fourth butt onto the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes out the list of names and looks it up and down.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten names ain’t that bad.  END
BEGIN NOW This could have been much worse than a list of ten names.  END
BEGIN NOW Could have been that Franco sent the cleaners right over to the club and they would have walked out with a linen bag full of Takira.  END
BEGIN NOW That would have been real bad.  END
BEGIN NOW And Takira’s thinking, “thank god I left that boy with Aunt Veronica.” Best decision she ever made.  END
BEGIN NOW One barren womb aunt made day care specialist.  END
BEGIN NOW Everybody wins. END
BEGIN NOW She’d love to drive over and see him right now.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d really love to.  END
BEGIN NOW But her instincts tell her she’s probably got a tail.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d put money on the idea that as soon as she pulled out of here another car would follow.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s getting a dumb idea right now.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking that maybe just parking the car and getting on a bus and taking a train and switching to another train and then maybe a bus then a cab and the tail might be gone by then.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she thinks a smart thought to counter act the dumb one.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s thinking that there’s probably some guy camped out by her apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s probably some guy watching Aunt Veronica’s place too.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, when you get a message like that, the only reasonable reaction is complete and total paranoia.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is now on the road to shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is going to be just fucking terrible.  END
BEGIN NOW A way out would be so cool right now.  END
BEGIN NOW A brilliant plan would really make her day.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco up and dying right now would convert her to every religion that ever was.  END
BEGIN NOW At least until she got over it.  END
BEGIN NOW At least until everything went back to normal.  END
BEGIN NOW And as Takira thinks all these things she’s smoked like eight cigarettes and is lighting a ninth.  END
BEGIN NOW Her throat is right pissed off.  END
BEGIN NOW Her throat is the least of her concerns.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the list again and wondering, END
BEGIN NOW “Where I have seen that name before?” END
BEGIN NOW She’s looking at the third entry on the list.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that says, “Anita Fairbanks.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Ten: Franco. END
BEGIN NOW Set sail for Stereotypes.  END
BEGIN NOW I want you to think about a villa.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice Spanish style one with the red tile roof and the quaint little fountain and lots of gardening happening everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the gardener gets paid to find unused soil and do something about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like a bunch of fucking leaves and flowers everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like Franco especially enjoyed flowers.  END
BEGIN NOW It was his wife’s wishes that were planted in that garden.  END
BEGIN NOW And his wife just adored the color green.  END
BEGIN NOW She loved green the way most people love hot chocolate in December.  END
BEGIN NOW  She loved green as if green pumped her quaint little heart into flowing what once was blood around in her veins.  END
BEGIN NOW Green was in her eyes and she made damn sure that everywhere on the property she went or would go or considered going would match her green like stagnant spring water eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco was a man.  END
BEGIN NOW He was one of those kinds of men that had one real wife and several other that thought they would be Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco someday when he finally did away with the one he married.  END
BEGIN NOW That just wasn’t going to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco’s first name was Mindy.  END
BEGIN NOW Mindy is the kind of name you give to a little girl that’s going to grow up and drop bombs on the world.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to drop bombs from up in her tower far above the clouds.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s going to remake the world in her image.  END
BEGIN NOW Her image was one of those you’ve seen on magazines in the supermarket.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of magazines they put next to the checkout lines with all those pretty faces on them.  END
BEGIN NOW Cover girls.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what they call ‘em. END
BEGIN NOW There was a time that Franco could keep up.  END
BEGIN NOW A time when he wasn’t an overweight house husband with a few business meetings a day.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time when business was booming and everything was going Franco’s way.  END
BEGIN NOW But that was like, ten years ago at least.  END
BEGIN NOW Now here he is.  END
BEGIN NOW All fat and always worried about something.  END
BEGIN NOW He still smokes cigars like a big shot.  END
BEGIN NOW He still walks around the garden getting lost in the sea of green.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he feels like he’s back in Honduras, watching his father take the goats out to slaughter.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s a little boy standing with his brothers and sisters and cousins and cousins and cousins.  END
BEGIN NOW And they’re all watching Abuelo Franco run a knife around the neck of a goat.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s holding the kid around the torso.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s sure to severe the artery that’ll drain the blood and get that goat ready for a big family meal. END
BEGIN NOW Franco takes a deep breath and takes in a lung full of sea air.  END
BEGIN NOW A cool inhale.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice break from the cigars.  END
BEGIN NOW Franco has a thing for pleated khaki pants and deck shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d rather be on his boat right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Mindy hates sailing.  END
BEGIN NOW The last thing Mindy would ever do is sail away.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even from shore to shore.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially not to the virgin seas.  END
BEGIN NOW That whole virgin seas thing is bullshit anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW You know sailors and their reputation.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, sailors have been at the seas as long as things could float.  END
BEGIN NOW The seas are defiled and filled with seamen. END
BEGIN NOW Franco stands in his garden letting the breeze blow on his chest hair between the buttons on his shirt, between the gaps in his slicked down comb-over.  END
BEGIN NOW  Mindy is standing on a balcony that comes out of the second story.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s standing there watching her husband putter around the garden like a little lost lamb that’s forgotten his way.  END
BEGIN NOW She shakes her head and in a voice that could strip the habit off a nun she yells, END
BEGIN NOW “MARTA!” and the sound of very small feet walking at a polite racing speed come pattering down the hall. END
BEGIN NOW “Si?” Marta asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Would you kindly tell Franco that dinner will be ready soon.  END
BEGIN NOW Also tell him I’m going to open that bottle of cab he’s been saving.” END
BEGIN NOW “Si Maestra.” And the feet scurry away down the hall, down the stairs, down more stairs and down into the garden and up to Franco who says, END
BEGIN NOW “That’s nice.” END
BEGIN NOW Dinner at Franco’s place is not the most pleasant experience for a fly on the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d be made uncomfortable a few times over.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d see the way Franco just sort of knocks his veggies around with a fork and stares at his plate.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d see how Mindy drinks a bottle of wine to herself before dinner is over.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d see Marta cleaning up broken glass and broken china all the while saying nothing but, “Si.” END
BEGIN NOW Mira.  END
BEGIN NOW Mira aqui.  END
BEGIN NOW Mindy is out on the patio, smoking long thin American cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking them between wrinkled fingers with glossy nails.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking them one at a time and watching the early evening sun sink into the waves of another balmy day.  END
BEGIN NOW Mindy is tired in a bad way.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s tired the way a general is when he comes out of retirement to do one more battle.  END
BEGIN NOW One more time.  END
BEGIN NOW Once more with feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twelve: Meet me in St.  END
BEGIN NOW Louise’s trailer. END
BEGIN NOW Let’s go back like ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW I know we’ve been jumping around all over the place and nothing’s really happening yet.  END
BEGIN NOW But hold on, just sit tight.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s go back twenty years ago. END
BEGIN NOW Barbara Waxbusch is wrapping up a concert in a punk club.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair is gelled and moused and pulled and teased in an array of waxy crayon colors.  END
BEGIN NOW Her band mates are all black leather and ripped jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW Spiked this and spiked that.  END
BEGIN NOW Chains and stains and everything has holes in it.  END
BEGIN NOW If you asked them, they’d say the holes were from fights they got into a few years back at some other club at some other time and this little bastard spilled his beer or someone’s beer and justice had to be served.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now they’re in the back alley behind the club, passing around a bottle of gut rot.  END
BEGIN NOW “Good show, man” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuckin’ A, good show.  END
BEGIN NOW That drum solo was fucking crazy.” END
BEGIN NOW “Man, did you see that guy throw up all over that one chick, the one in the red?” END
BEGIN NOW “Right in the front fucking row!” END
BEGIN NOW “Damn, we’re so cool.” END
BEGIN NOW And Barbara is leaning against the dumpster smoking a menthol cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Barbara’s all like, meh.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks cooler than she actually is.  END
BEGIN NOW And she knows it.  END
BEGIN NOW The band is called Landing Strip Express and street drugs are always on the menu.  END
BEGIN NOW And Barbara is all like: END
BEGIN NOW “Man.” END
BEGIN NOW And the band’s all like, “huh?” END
BEGIN NOW And Barbara just sighs more and drags on her cigarette like it’s the last life left in the universe and she’s mad as all hell for no real reason.  END
BEGIN NOW She storms off and throws her still burning butt at the street and slams the door to her trailer.  END
BEGIN NOW When I say her trailer I really mean the outhouse in the back. END
BEGIN NOW The band is all like, END
BEGIN NOW “What the fuck.” END
BEGIN NOW And Barbara is all crying herself to some semblance of sleep on a nasty ass shit can. END
BEGIN NOW She’s hoping she’s not going to throw up in the morning again.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially because she hasn’t been drinking for a week.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially because she tested positive for a parasite known as pregnancy.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the kind of thing that can ruin a girls day. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter The Next One From Here END
BEGIN NOW I can’t really remember what’s happening with the story any more.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really want to go back and read what has already been written.  END
BEGIN NOW So I’m going to start somewhere and see where we go with it.  END
BEGIN NOW This could take a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Just hold on.  END
BEGIN NOW Bear with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Or bare with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way. END
BEGIN NOW So we’re in this bar.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s our girl Cha Cha sitting down drinking beers and shooting whiskies.  END
BEGIN NOW In the door around that time in walks Oskar.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor ol’ Oskar.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks up to the bar and asks for bourbon and rocks.  END
BEGIN NOW He asks for a lot of bourbon, please.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice big glass of bourbon and rocks that he can sip on for a good long time.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender, the one shaped like an S, like the personification of the word seduction. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter One END
BEGIN NOW I awoke nowhere near Paris.  END
BEGIN NOW A whoosh and a blur and lights and off they went to pick up Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev and I were parked on the side of the road.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev was an old truck.  END
BEGIN NOW Old but fairly reliable.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev and I were on our way back home.  END
BEGIN NOW  We’d stopped off for a toke and to kill that half pint of JB.  END
BEGIN NOW Jimmy, the Chev and I all curled up in the front seat together.  END
BEGIN NOW A girl and her two best friends in one place at one time.  END
BEGIN NOW A little whiskey baby in the womb of my truck.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there were the sirens and the lights and defiantly not Paris.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is not so much a field of long dry grass.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is not so much long winding coastal roads.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is really archways and whores and rows and rows of streetlights.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is baguettes and espresso, berets and drunken artists painting absolute shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is a big ass tower that some people think it’s clever to jump off of.  END
BEGIN NOW Paris is not so much anywhere near me. END
BEGIN NOW Absolute shit was in my thoughts and out of my mouth all along the pursuit home.  END
BEGIN NOW “Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW That Motherfucker.” I slapped the steering wheel with an open palm repeatedly.  END
BEGIN NOW  The empty bottle had to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Out the window to lie in the grass.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a good spot for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Just chill for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW The closer you get to home the longer it takes to get there.  END
BEGIN NOW When there are a couple of cops blazing a trail in front of you then it might take until tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW  You just might pass by your street and take the next one over and try to see what’s going on at your house before you pull up the driveway like a chump.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev pulled up to a spot where I could see the cops parked in front of the house.  END
BEGIN NOW There were no signs of struggle.  END
BEGIN NOW No cries for help.  END
BEGIN NOW The arrest was made quietly.  END
BEGIN NOW I watched them take Roscoe into the sheriff’s car.  END
BEGIN NOW He had one those click tight ribbons around his wrists.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked pitiful.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I could hear him moan, “aww man.  END
BEGIN NOW Really?” Before they took him away.  END
BEGIN NOW They exited the scene without the sound and lights, driving legally for the first time in two hours.  END
BEGIN NOW  I crawled around a bush and through the eucalyptus trees.  END
BEGIN NOW  The house was as empty as ever.  END
BEGIN NOW They got Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW But they did not take the reason Roscoe was arrested with them.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t have that kind of time on their hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Or the proper vehicle to transport all of it.  END
BEGIN NOW I however.  END
BEGIN NOW I however had the Chev.  END
BEGIN NOW While the Chev and I could only take so much right now and later wouldn’t be a safe option.  END
BEGIN NOW This had to be a now or never operation.  END
BEGIN NOW  I walk through an unlocked door into my own home, knowing that I’m going to have to abandon the place for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW I pack the essentials first.  END
BEGIN NOW Clothes, toiletries, a whole duffel bag stuffed full of essentials.  END
BEGIN NOW Phone charger and a few good books.  END
BEGIN NOW One small hash pipe of great personal significance.  END
BEGIN NOW  All the cash I had stashed around the house.  END
BEGIN NOW All the cash I knew Roscoe stashed around the house.  END
BEGIN NOW And finally, to Roscoe’s private reserve. END
BEGIN NOW Every year in Amsterdam there’s an event called the Cannabis Cup.  END
BEGIN NOW Every year marijuana growers from around the world come and meet for a few days to swap seeds and stories.  END
BEGIN NOW To smoke bowls and joints and bong hits.  END
BEGIN NOW And to submit an entry in the competition.  END
BEGIN NOW Who grows the best weed in the world? Roscoe had heard of the cannabis cup when he was young.  END
BEGIN NOW Very young.  END
BEGIN NOW From a young age, Roscoe dreamed of winning the cannabis cup.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to eventually, judge the Cannabis cup.  END
BEGIN NOW Aspirations from day one of sixth grade.  END
BEGIN NOW Grow the best weed in the world and achieve fame, respect, and lots and lots of money.  END
BEGIN NOW Selling the seeds of a winning strand would net him an early retirement fund.  END
BEGIN NOW While in retirement, he would grow more weed.  END
BEGIN NOW That was Roscoe’s life plan.  END
BEGIN NOW The big one.  END
BEGIN NOW The response to all those questions of what do you want to be when you grow up? A fucking baller.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what Roscoe would have said.  END
BEGIN NOW My boyfriend’s being hauled off to county and I’m at home finding all his seeds.  END
BEGIN NOW All his cured bud and getting two more duffel bags to carry it.  END
BEGIN NOW I take a small scale and a box of baggies.  END
BEGIN NOW Never know.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to have to skip town and work for a few days until I know what’s going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Lord knows what I could be implicated in or what that dumbass is telling the cops.  END
BEGIN NOW  Or why the hell he’s locked up now in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW All I know is that I could be in trouble too.  END
BEGIN NOW Terrible things could be coming my way.  END
BEGIN NOW I pack all the money and marijuana and a coat and hat and anything else I might need.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s half a fifth of whiskey in the house.  END
BEGIN NOW I might need that.  END
BEGIN NOW It stays under my arm as I haul three huge bags packed full of the essentials back to the Chev.  END
BEGIN NOW The bags take up most of the cab.  END
BEGIN NOW I can deal with that.  END
BEGIN NOW I decide it’s as good as a time as any to smoke a bowl.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to call that women’s intuition. END
BEGIN NOW It’s dawn near Davenport.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea air is around here somewhere, but I’m just far enough inland that it teases with your senses.  END
BEGIN NOW  You might be near the coast.  END
BEGIN NOW You won’t be quite sure.  END
BEGIN NOW But drive west enough and it will be there.  END
BEGIN NOW The sleepy little town of Davenport.  END
BEGIN NOW A beach and a road house and a taqueria.  END
BEGIN NOW Railroad tracks and run down everything.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a post office, which I think justifies the whole idea of a town.  END
BEGIN NOW You can meet your whole town at the P.O.  END
BEGIN NOW if you go there long enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is going to have to send a package at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW Or buy some stamps.  END
BEGIN NOW Or envelopes.  END
BEGIN NOW You can meet everyone here.  END
BEGIN NOW It just takes time.  END
BEGIN NOW In a town like this that means people are going to talk and know who they’re talking about.  END
BEGIN NOW When word of the arrest hits the post office, it will spread like chunky peanut butter on the sandwich bread of children all across America on the first day of school.  END
BEGIN NOW The bars will catch wind later that night when the drinkers come out to play, mingling with the rest of the working class.  END
BEGIN NOW By noon tomorrow it will be old news.  END
BEGIN NOW Something that’s already happened in everyone’s mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe will be referred to as that strange farmer boy that had to ship at least two packages a week.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them going to Europe.  END
BEGIN NOW He will be remembered as that awkward young man with the long hair and dark sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW  He will mostly be remembered as that guy that got arrested for growing large amounts of grass.  END
BEGIN NOW He will most certainly be remembered for being a bit of a dumbass. END
BEGIN NOW “That fucking idiot.” I said sparking a second bowl.  END
BEGIN NOW “That fucking retard.” END
BEGIN NOW How could anyone be quite so stupid? I know the growers industry is a pretty shady operation in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW Taking advantage of legal loop holes and local versus federal laws and what not.  END
BEGIN NOW But still.  END
BEGIN NOW Prosecution is pretty low.  END
BEGIN NOW No one really cares enough to waste tax dollars on a weed grower right now.  END
BEGIN NOW There are bigger fish to fry.  END
BEGIN NOW At least in these parts.  END
BEGIN NOW California is a hot bed for every kind of activity imaginable.  END
BEGIN NOW  Growing a little pot isn’t going to send you away for life any more.  END
BEGIN NOW So, now what? I now have a Chev full of borderline legal cargo.  END
BEGIN NOW Not really that full.  END
BEGIN NOW But full enough.  END
BEGIN NOW My options are north to San Francisco, south to Santa Cruz or east, to the sunrise and the great beyond.  END
BEGIN NOW I have options for a safe house either north or south.  END
BEGIN NOW South to surf city.  END
BEGIN NOW North to the sprawling metropolis.  END
BEGIN NOW To sky scrapers and and subways and everything that ever was. END
BEGIN NOW Down south is also my sister.  END
BEGIN NOW Marjorie is definitely in Santa Cruz.  END
BEGIN NOW She certainly has an apartment and a dog and a couch for her little sister.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like the best place to regroup, recharge and figure it out from there.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, family should always be able to help you out.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter how bad it looks.  END
BEGIN NOW I call her, still parked and looking at my house through bloodshot eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW She answers the phone with a croak in her voice. END
BEGIN NOW “Dude.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s before noon.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s before noon on my day off.  END
BEGIN NOW Why the fuck would you ever call me before noon on my day off? I thought we had established rules about this kind of thing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Look, sis, dude.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sorry alright.  END
BEGIN NOW But shit just went down.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit just hit a fan of epic proportions.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit is fucked up right now.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Emergency situation.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s cool.  END
BEGIN NOW You can call me if it’s an emergency.  END
BEGIN NOW Hold on.” A toilet flushes in the background, the sounds of a sink and soap and hands being washed.  END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s hear your little dilemma.” END
BEGIN NOW “Roscoe just got arrested.” END
BEGIN NOW “Roscoe? Your boyfriend? What the hell could he have possibly done to get arrested? He’s like, the most inactive guy I’ve ever met.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t have the willpower to get arrested.  END
BEGIN NOW Is couch surfing illegal now?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, Marjorie.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was growing a lot of weed.  END
BEGIN NOW  I mean.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Of weed.  END
BEGIN NOW He had the basement filled with plants.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why we got that house.  END
BEGIN NOW Huge Basement.  END
BEGIN NOW Big Plus.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s still illegal? I mean, even in Cali?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, still illegal in the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW That means still illegal in Cali.” END
BEGIN NOW “When did this happen? I mean its balls early in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW You must be parked somewhere as a witness.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, hiding out across the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Or rather, in the neighbor’s driveway.” END
BEGIN NOW “Shit, dude.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I got everything I need from the house.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m ready to get lost for a minute.” END
BEGIN NOW “Good girl.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what’s the plan? Sell a bit from the private collection? Make bail?” END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey, alright listen.  END
BEGIN NOW Would it be cool if I just crashed at your place for a few days, figured out something?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh fuck no.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, sis, come on.  END
BEGIN NOW I really need a place right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I just woke up to this.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, well, so did I! Thanks for that.” END
BEGIN NOW “Are you serious? After that time when you crashed dad’s car into mom’s car and I helped you make it look like someone else’s fault? After that one time when you totally blamed me for killing grandma, which I might add had nothing to do with either of us.  END
BEGIN NOW She just died.  END
BEGIN NOW  It was her time.  END
BEGIN NOW  She was old and ready and just because we thought it would be funny…” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, ok, ok.” END
BEGIN NOW “And that one time in Mexico!” END
BEGIN NOW “For fuck’s sake Laurel! I get the point.  END
BEGIN NOW I was just fucking with you anyways.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course you can crash here for a while, that’s totally cool.  END
BEGIN NOW Just don’t come over until noon.  END
BEGIN NOW  I have to kick someone out first.  END
BEGIN NOW And give him a long goodbye.” END
BEGIN NOW “Awesome.  END
BEGIN NOW  I can take my time.  END
BEGIN NOW Is he anyone I know?” END
BEGIN NOW “Probably.” END
BEGIN NOW “Probably? That’s all you’re going to give me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yep.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll have some Pop Tarts waiting for you when you walk in the door.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re a crown jewel in our royal family.  END
BEGIN NOW Love you Marjie. END
BEGIN NOW “Love you too, sis.  END
BEGIN NOW Later.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter two: END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t exactly sure how he got there.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, the how not so much a mystery as the why he was there.  END
BEGIN NOW They were holding him in a florescent room with hard plastic seating arrangements.  END
BEGIN NOW  The other occupants of the room were two and a half bums.  END
BEGIN NOW The half bum was only pretending to be as much.  END
BEGIN NOW The other two were the genuine article.  END
BEGIN NOW You could tell by the way their eyes were not anywhere near the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes were in deep space or talking to god.  END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes never rested.  END
BEGIN NOW When you dream at night, your eyes twitch under the lids, moving from side to side between memory and creation.  END
BEGIN NOW Their eyes moved just like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Except the lids were open.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they talked in their sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe was huddled onto a chair, trying to sleep, trying to do anything except be there then.  END
BEGIN NOW  The half bum looked him over and shook his head.  END
BEGIN NOW “Look, kid, look.” The half bum shook a dirty hand at him to get his attention.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey kid, hey.  END
BEGIN NOW  Hey man look at me!” END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe looked up in between fear and avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t want to acknowledge the half bum.  END
BEGIN NOW That could prove disastrous.  END
BEGIN NOW That would initiate conversation or worse.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t want to listen.  END
BEGIN NOW He just wanted to sit there and wait for the scene to change. END
BEGIN NOW “Look, asshole, I mean kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Listen.  END
BEGIN NOW What the fuck are you doing here? You don’t belong here.  END
BEGIN NOW This is my room.  END
BEGIN NOW Who the fuck let you in here? And who has permission to let guests into my room? I sure don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW I am locked up here.  END
BEGIN NOW They won’t let me out until tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what it takes to get back in this room in fifteen minutes? Let me tell you.” The half bum pauses to cough up mucus and blood on to the cold concrete floor.  END
BEGIN NOW “Let me tell you something about perseverance.” END
BEGIN NOW Groaning and feeling the red strips on his wrists.  END
BEGIN NOW The plastic ties were completely unnecessary.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t struggle or fight or give any sign of desperate measures.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was a push over.  END
BEGIN NOW A limp wrist in the wind of authority.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a rag on a flag pole waving around to the will of the breeze.  END
BEGIN NOW  Roscoe went along quietly into the police car and down to the station.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t say anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.  END
BEGIN NOW So silence sounded like the best option.  END
BEGIN NOW That and he was still a bit stoned.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always in between sedation in one form or another.  END
BEGIN NOW The police doing little to jar him from the heavy load of the hashish currently running loops and twists in his blood stream.  END
BEGIN NOW “Perseverance is key! Key! The man out there will try and get you down.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll try anything to crush your spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW You and I have something he’ll never have.  END
BEGIN NOW We have the intelligence to read between the long winded lines of the law.  END
BEGIN NOW We can see things for what they are.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why I’m here.  END
BEGIN NOW Why are you here? You never said anything to me this whole time.” The half bum scratches at his crotch with gusto. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know man.  END
BEGIN NOW I really don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s early in the morning still.” Roscoe fidgets around, trying to get comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW “Is it? Kid, this room exists outside of time.  END
BEGIN NOW You better scrap your notions of where you might be going and plans you may have made.  END
BEGIN NOW Because as long as you’re inside here.  END
BEGIN NOW The outside will go on without you.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.  END
BEGIN NOW No phone calls.  END
BEGIN NOW No nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW They got your wallet and any personal possessions with them out there.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t even have shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW How do you expect to do anything without shoes?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t expect to do anything, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t have expectations.” END
BEGIN NOW “See, that’s your problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, that’s one of your problems.  END
BEGIN NOW  We can get into the other ones later.  END
BEGIN NOW But first off, these expectations you don’t have.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s wrong with you?  Why don’t you have expectations? Why don’t you have shoes?” END
BEGIN NOW “When did this become about me? I’m just here for some reason.  END
BEGIN NOW They won’t tell me.  END
BEGIN NOW They just say things like, ‘Oh, I think you know’ and ‘you did this to yourself, cocksucker.’ What a bunch of assholes.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well you are what you eat, as my dear old dad would have said.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he would have said something like that if the epilepsy let him talk more.  END
BEGIN NOW You strike me as something of a pussy.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you eat a lot of pussy?” END
BEGIN NOW “There was a time, I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what you mean by a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW  Are we talking variety or frequency?” END
BEGIN NOW “It doesn’t really matter.  END
BEGIN NOW The point is, the point being.  END
BEGIN NOW Point is.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever expect to eat some pussy?” The half bum shifts in his plastic chair, remembering the best tulip he ever smelled. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, sure, there was a time when I considered it dessert.  END
BEGIN NOW You know? Like you just had a nice meal and now you move on and between a pair of legs.  END
BEGIN NOW Spreading your way to culinary glory, tongue deep in the sweetest piece of pie you could find.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, ok.  END
BEGIN NOW  I get it.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a pussy.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a pussy and you are what you eat.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s fantastic.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m very happy for you.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel much better about you not raping me now.” END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell? You were expecting me to rape you? Are we in prison? Is this really what prison is like? I was expecting more bars.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh no, we’re not in prison, this here is just holding.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where they keep you until they know what to do with you.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll never know what to do with me.  END
BEGIN NOW I keep surprising them.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m smarter than them.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why I’ll be stuck in holding for a good long time.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe they’ll let me go again.  END
BEGIN NOW But who knows? I certainly don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW Not my job to know things.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just here.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude! You just said something about me not raping you and I guess that wasn’t really important.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you exist solely as an extension of shock value? I mean, dude.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriously.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ha! Got you good that time didn’t I? Yeah, the ol’ rape line riles a few feathers now and then.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t let it get to you.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just rehearsing for the day they really get me.  END
BEGIN NOW When I go to state or the fed.  END
BEGIN NOW Then I’ll need every shred of wits at my disposal.  END
BEGIN NOW You worry a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean you are a pussy and that’s something that pussies do.  END
BEGIN NOW Worry about a bunch of shit they can’t fix or change or do a damn thing about.  END
BEGIN NOW Just sit and worry.  END
BEGIN NOW That’ll get you places.  END
BEGIN NOW Doors will open at your shoeless worry worn feet.  END
BEGIN NOW You make me sick.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like eating pussy makes me want to puke.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright man, alright.  END
BEGIN NOW I get it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just shut the hell up and let me sit here, trying to nap or something.” END
BEGIN NOW “Nah, I don’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW Time passes faster if we talk.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if we just end up screaming at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s better than nothing.” The half bum flicks bits of dead skin out from between his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW “How could screaming possibly be better than nothing? What kind of sense does that make?” END
BEGIN NOW “Because there’s an exchange of attention! It’s not neglect, and nothing is worse than neglect.  END
BEGIN NOW Neglect says ‘I just don’t care about you.’ Or it would, if neglect actually cared enough to acknowledge your existence.  END
BEGIN NOW  Neglect will leave you cold and lonely and leave you there to die, not even pretending that you matter.  END
BEGIN NOW But screaming at least means there’s an emotional investment.  END
BEGIN NOW We only scream about things that really matter.  END
BEGIN NOW It takes a lot to make most people scream.  END
BEGIN NOW But a neglectful person would never bother to scream.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a lot of effort.  END
BEGIN NOW And there are always better things to do than scream.” END
BEGIN NOW “Of course there are better things to do than scream.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of better things.  END
BEGIN NOW No one has to scream to make their point.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s totally unnecessary.” END
BEGIN NOW “Are you a neglectful pussy? Is that what your problem is? A neglectful pussy with no expectations?” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Why are you digging in to me like that? What did I ever do to you?” END
BEGIN NOW “You barge into my room and expect me not to dig into you a bit? You’ve got some nerve.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course I’m going to rip into you.  END
BEGIN NOW All the other options have been exhausted.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not really interested in your life story.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t believe mine or care enough, especially since my life story has absolutely nothing to do with you.  END
BEGIN NOW So we could sit here and bore each other to death, or I can mock you and pray on your insecurities, much to my own amusement.” END
BEGIN NOW “You know you’re an articulate motherfucker for being a bum.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I’m only half way there.  END
BEGIN NOW The other half is on the way.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s later.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now…” END
BEGIN NOW The sound of a door opening interrupts everything in this room.  END
BEGIN NOW The two and half bums are at a kind of attention and Roscoe is perked up and listening.  END
BEGIN NOW A man in uniform looks at everyone in the room in disgust. END
BEGIN NOW “Beecher.  END
BEGIN NOW First name… illegible…” END
BEGIN NOW The half bum giggles to himself and slaps Roscoe on the back. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, my name’s Beecher.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t give a fuck who you think you are.  END
BEGIN NOW Get out of my room.” And with that he leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaves and now all Roscoe has are two regular bums with amphetamine teeth and Listerine hangovers.  END
BEGIN NOW  They don’t look at anything even slightly resembling Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW One of them mumbles quietly.  END
BEGIN NOW The other begins humming Oh, Canada.  END
BEGIN NOW A Roscoe’s spine is an ice luge dripping sweat cold enough to shoot in a glass.  END
BEGIN NOW The Canadians.  END
BEGIN NOW The fucking Canadians. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Three: END
BEGIN NOW Highway one runs along the coast like a prodigal son.  END
BEGIN NOW Wayward and misguided.  END
BEGIN NOW Giving hints of an ocean and the distant just over the cliff visions of waves breaking.  END
BEGIN NOW This road doesn’t work as well at dawn as it does at dusk.  END
BEGIN NOW With dusk you get the sunset on your right and the tree infested mountains on your left.  END
BEGIN NOW With dusk you get a cool night breeze that will tickle your arm with salt water spray as you navigate the air currents with an open palm.  END
BEGIN NOW With one wing extended you will dream of catching flight and soaring above the roads, piloting off pockets of thermal uprisings.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just like a bird.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like a bird in a beat up Chevy truck hugging the curves in all the right ways.  END
BEGIN NOW Except it’s just after dawn and the sea on the right undulates like a sequined sheet hanging out to dry. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel steers one handed, sipping from a paper cup of coffee whenever she can.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes it easy, at least the driving.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no hurry.  END
BEGIN NOW  She has a good three hours before she can see her sister.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not one to arrive without gifts to a family function.  END
BEGIN NOW And Marjorie isn’t the easiest girl to shop for.  END
BEGIN NOW She never wants or appreciates gifts.  END
BEGIN NOW “Fucking clutter and useless crap.” That’s what she calls most gifts after the giver is out of earshot.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll find a way to get rid of most anything.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you get the girl that appreciates little and holds on to next to nothing? Breakfast.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s exactly what you get her.  END
BEGIN NOW She will love you for feeding her.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll love you anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW But now with a full belly everything will be that much easier. END
BEGIN NOW The road takes the Chev down into the start of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Effortlessly becoming Mission Street.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost every good sized town in California has a mission street.  END
BEGIN NOW In grade school history they will blame this on a Father Junipero Serra.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a man that traveled up and down the coast converting heathens and building missions.  END
BEGIN NOW More than likely using the native labor force.  END
BEGIN NOW The great grandparents of the men that stand around the hardware stores and lumber yards looking for day labor jobs all week long.  END
BEGIN NOW In towns just like Santa Cruz.  END
BEGIN NOW All over California. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel drives into town.  END
BEGIN NOW Hardly anything is open.  END
BEGIN NOW It is Sunday and it is before noon.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone with a shred of common sense would be asleep right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Asleep or in church or maybe reading the paper over a cup of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Or going to the gym.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe they would be jogging.  END
BEGIN NOW Point is.  END
BEGIN NOW Point being.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s really early on a Sunday.  END
BEGIN NOW And no one wants to be at work right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially not the few people that are at work right now.  END
BEGIN NOW And they all work in Restaurants, Gas Stations, and Coffee Shops.  END
BEGIN NOW This group of people doesn’t know what a weekend is supposed to be.  END
BEGIN NOW When all their friends are at parties on a Friday or Saturday, they are at home, going to sleep so they can get up at six or eight in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW And open up shop. END
BEGIN NOW This is exactly the type of girl that made Laurel’s coffee this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW And she will meet the same type of girl at the café where she stops to order two everything bagels with lox and cream cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW  The girl behind the register will not smile.  END
BEGIN NOW Not really.  END
BEGIN NOW It might look like a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW It might resemble something of a genuine smile.  END
BEGIN NOW But it will be a distant relative of a smile, the one that’s always being mistaken for her cousin at parties. END
BEGIN NOW The bagels safe on the passenger seat, Laurel still has an hour and a half to kill.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is there to do at ten thirty on a Sunday? You could go to church.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea strikes you as novel.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a silly passing notion.  END
BEGIN NOW You could go to the wharf and watch the beach at sunrise.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so bad, but not as good as sunset.  END
BEGIN NOW West Coast and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Sun does set in the west.  END
BEGIN NOW Too bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe later.  END
BEGIN NOW But right now you might as well drink some coffee and look at the ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW The ocean will give you peace of mind.  END
BEGIN NOW The vastness of the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW It will give you some perspective.  END
BEGIN NOW The giant blue mass.  END
BEGIN NOW Always there and waving around.  END
BEGIN NOW Going nowhere.  END
BEGIN NOW  Going everywhere at once.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the ocean for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely reliable.  END
BEGIN NOW Driving out to west cliff seems like the most reasonable thing to do right now.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev pulls into the parking lot by the wharf.  END
BEGIN NOW There are restrooms here with outside showers built in.  END
BEGIN NOW They must be for washing off all that sand.  END
BEGIN NOW  There’s a walkway that will take you right on to the beach.  END
BEGIN NOW Or there’s a sidewalk that will take you to the wharf with another café and more restaurants, all of which are serving brunch right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Champagne and eggs.  END
BEGIN NOW Last night’s steak with last night’s potatoes and a glass of champagne with orange juice.  END
BEGIN NOW They call that a mimosa.  END
BEGIN NOW The cross breed of two of America’s favorite breakfast drinks. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel feels the stiff salty breeze on her face.  END
BEGIN NOW The chill of autumn winds coming off the ocean just after dawn.  END
BEGIN NOW The salt water and several sea lions waking up, barking like a kennel full of strays that will never fetch baseballs again.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks down at the fat beasts.  END
BEGIN NOW How they lie there, seemingly content.  END
BEGIN NOW Bellies hanging off the wooden beams of the wharf.  END
BEGIN NOW Fat, lazy bastards.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a care in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW  They pay her absolutely no attention.  END
BEGIN NOW  She looks down at them, she looks down and she frowns slightly exhausted and perturbed. END
BEGIN NOW “Why do you miserable fuck-stains get all the luck? You don’t have boyfriends running illegal operations in your house! You don’t even have laws! You just lay around, being fat and full of fish.  END
BEGIN NOW What the fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Where’s my laying around time? When do I get to retire? You can’t be so old.  END
BEGIN NOW You couldn’t have earned that kind of life.  END
BEGIN NOW What did I ever do that was so bad, so bad as to be exiled from my own home?” END
BEGIN NOW You’re not so much mad at them as they are just there to absorb your anger.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW They can’t even understand a word you’re saying.  END
BEGIN NOW  You’re just a different kind of background noise.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea lions want nothing to do with you unless you can provide food or entertainment.  END
BEGIN NOW You are not a fish.  END
BEGIN NOW You are not so interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea lions bark indiscriminately.  END
BEGIN NOW You remain inconsequential.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel frowns at the sea lions.  END
BEGIN NOW The sea lions just lie there.  END
BEGIN NOW On the beams.  END
BEGIN NOW Same place they will be tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW And they still won’t give a fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW If she had something heavy to throw, she might think about throwing it now.  END
BEGIN NOW Knocking one of those great sea beasts upside the head.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature wouldn’t care if she did.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature lets the sharks kill the sea lions.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature lets volcano’s erupt and spew lava into the ocean making islands and are destined to become the luxury resorts of the super rich.  END
BEGIN NOW Nature doesn’t give a fuck what we do anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all been done before.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re just trying to stay alive.  END
BEGIN NOW And so is nature.  END
BEGIN NOW We do not have the upper hand in this situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother Nature is not a housewife that will take a black eye sitting down.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother Nature will burn your house down with you inside it.  END
BEGIN NOW She will collect the insurance and settle down in a nice beach community with gates to keep out the ruffians and vagabonds.  END
BEGIN NOW Mother Nature will move on and you will be fertilizing a bed of wild flowers.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the wharf consists of a few seafood restaurants with poor to mediocre food.  END
BEGIN NOW They will all be serving brunch right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Brunch with an ocean view.  END
BEGIN NOW How nice.  END
BEGIN NOW We can sip mimosas and eat our eggs Benedict while the kids munch on French toast and drink their colas and other assorted soft drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW We can talk about the future while the kids send text messages to their friends back home, telling them about how lame it is to be eating French toast with their family so early on a Sunday morning.  END
BEGIN NOW They will stare at anything aside from the Pacific Ocean stretching out towards Japan and south East Asia.  END
BEGIN NOW Going all directions at once because it is an ocean.  END
BEGIN NOW Because it’s really all the same body of water.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just too damn big so we had to divide it into seven sections and give them all names.  END
BEGIN NOW  Division and name calling.  END
BEGIN NOW The ocean is grade school all over again.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a math problem and a nickname you never wanted to hear.  END
BEGIN NOW Walking down on the wooden walkway, Laurel passes the candy shop, the various tourist gift shops, all with over priced jewelry and hats.  END
BEGIN NOW  Cheap sunglasses and swimwear.  END
BEGIN NOW Because some people show up to the beach without sunglasses or a suit.  END
BEGIN NOW Expecting not to need such things.  END
BEGIN NOW Being proven terribly wrong and now forced to spend twice the retail value of some cloth that will allow them to be in a socially acceptable state while on the beach.  END
BEGIN NOW Such is the scene in Surf City, USA. END
BEGIN NOW There was an article in the paper a little while ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Something about how Hamilton Beach was claiming the rights to Surf City, USA and Santa Cruz had pretty much established the use of that moniker for something like forty years.  END
BEGIN NOW There were songs about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Books.  END
BEGIN NOW  Photographs lining most of the businesses that capitalized on the whole surfing thing.  END
BEGIN NOW None of those had any effect on Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW All she could think about now was eating that bagel that was sitting in the Chev.  END
BEGIN NOW All this wharf walking and sea lions and brunch nonsense made her terribly hungry. END
BEGIN NOW Eating breakfast in a parking lot is an acquired art form.  END
BEGIN NOW Not everyone can pull this feat off with grace and style.  END
BEGIN NOW You need a certain kind of nonchalance.  END
BEGIN NOW  You must possess at your disposal an attitude that states simultaneously, I am cooler than you.  END
BEGIN NOW And yeah, I’m eating breakfast standing up, leaning on my old ass truck.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you, my dad could beat up your dad.  END
BEGIN NOW End of argument.  END
BEGIN NOW  You should probably wear sunglasses when you do this.  END
BEGIN NOW You might consider taking up smoking just to look cool in a parking lot after eating a bagel with your sunglasses on.  END
BEGIN NOW  That’s something the Fonz would have done.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the kind of cool that will never die. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel picks a piece of lox off the bagel and drops it into her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She licks cream cheese off lips and pushes her sunglasses up the bridge of her nose using her little finger.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this while resting against the Chev with one foot and the other firmly on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW She observes an early morning intersection, marked by a liquor store; a café with a restaurant attached, and railroad tracks cutting through.  END
BEGIN NOW  Does anyone still jump trains? That sounds like great way to travel.  END
BEGIN NOW Hitch a train right here and take it down to L.A.  END
BEGIN NOW Or up north to San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe there’s a train that goes east from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Not here, here.  END
BEGIN NOW But somewhere along the way.  END
BEGIN NOW This track is mostly for a tourist train that runs through the redwoods.  END
BEGIN NOW From Felton to Santa Cruz and back again.  END
BEGIN NOW From the heart of the Valley to the Beach.  END
BEGIN NOW The morning is still warm.  END
BEGIN NOW  As soon as the sun comes up the temperature changes to remind you that it’s been an Indian summer.  END
BEGIN NOW The afternoon will be mostly cloudless.  END
BEGIN NOW It will still be shorts and tee shirts and sandals weather.  END
BEGIN NOW  This is perfectly agreeable.  END
BEGIN NOW The sunshine and Laurel get along like rain and root vegetables.  END
BEGIN NOW She basks in the calm morning air, licking the last of the cream cheese and crumbs from her fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW She still has an hour to deal with.  END
BEGIN NOW She has an hour to mill around and be distracted by a sleepy beach town, recovering from wave after wave of foreigners on sightseeing trips.  END
BEGIN NOW College students coming into town to scope out the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Seeing if this town is all it’s cracked up to be.  END
BEGIN NOW They will walk down Pacific Avenue in herds, led by a guide that will explain to them how cool this town is.  END
BEGIN NOW  The influx of new students will determine the city budget, will affect the public transportation system, and will undoubtedly over crowd the handful of decent bars.  END
BEGIN NOW  The new students will bring a barrage of baggage with them and they will litter the streets with their nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW Down Pacific Avenue is a good morning walk.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be a sidewalk stroll with all kinds of smells and sights.  END
BEGIN NOW From the beach to Pacific will be weeds and chain linked fence.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be a road in need of repair.  END
BEGIN NOW  The shops begin around the Chinese restaurant and the car stereo place, next door to the used car lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there will be two dive bars in various degrees right next to each other.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the best place in town to score hard drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW At very least, it is the most convenient.  END
BEGIN NOW You can pretty much be sure to get something along the lines of whatever you’re looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW Quality is completely inconsistent.  END
BEGIN NOW But this is a convenience store for contraband.  END
BEGIN NOW This isn’t a farmer’s market or co-op.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the Seven Eleven of discount crack cocaine.  END
BEGIN NOW You can be sure it’s cut.  END
BEGIN NOW You can be sure you’re going to get ripped off a few times.  END
BEGIN NOW But hey, that’s business. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a liquor store just after that.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the right size for a corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW There will always be one of three people working behind the register.  END
BEGIN NOW This adds to the homey small town ambiance of the place.  END
BEGIN NOW A familiar face behind the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW A man that will know what kind of liquor you drink and what brand of cigarettes you smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW A man that will know your face and your name but still check your I.D.  END
BEGIN NOW every time.  END
BEGIN NOW Smile.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re on a security camera. END
BEGIN NOW Because it’s a Sunday and there’s not so much to be doing, because Santa Cruz is a town that’s never in a hurry, you will be tempted to relax.  END
BEGIN NOW To take it easy.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel takes a leisurely pace, hands in pockets of well worn blue jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW Feet in socks and sneakers coated with different layers of dust and dirt.  END
BEGIN NOW Torso in a shirt of muted color, faded from years of washing and being worked in.  END
BEGIN NOW Her small frame well tanned from digging in the dirt, from harvesting in the late summer sun.  END
BEGIN NOW Her arms will be toned with muscles from lifting crates of beets and bunches of radishes.  END
BEGIN NOW  Having a farm job means never needing a gym membership. END
BEGIN NOW Having a farm job means you learn how to grow some fantastic marijuana.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks around for a joint smoking area.  END
BEGIN NOW  A safe haven from prying eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that’s she’s scared of the cops, not exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW Not here.  END
BEGIN NOW Her drug of choice is pretty low on the cities list of priorities.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s more concerned with the mooches.  END
BEGIN NOW They will smell the pungent, sweet aroma of burning Mary and follow her until she is found.  END
BEGIN NOW She remembers a place not too far from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Either down a cross street to the bleachers at the high school.  END
BEGIN NOW In the opposite direction to the levy.  END
BEGIN NOW Or down Pacific a ways until there’s a parking garage.  END
BEGIN NOW Not much of anyone is on top of a parking garage early on a Sunday.  END
BEGIN NOW Peace and quiet and a view.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds just about right. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel walks to the right side of the road.  END
BEGIN NOW She crosses the street and walks past the Mexican restaurant and the metro station.  END
BEGIN NOW The city metro and a Greyhound station.  END
BEGIN NOW Launch pad to out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Last hope for escape for the carless.  END
BEGIN NOW The refugees sleep under the overhang, keeping safe from the sunshine and maintaining sleep in the shade.  END
BEGIN NOW Crusty kids with army surplus matched luggage.  END
BEGIN NOW  From who knows where.  END
BEGIN NOW Going anywhere else.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting nowhere fast.  END
BEGIN NOW These are the kids that will catch wind of your smoky bowl and inquire about getting some.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a hit.  END
BEGIN NOW Please? Spot me a bowl? Anything? Business is business and right now this is Laurel’s only resource.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s going to have to safeguard her source of income.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t pinch too much from the till.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep enough to get that dumbass out of wherever he ended up.  END
BEGIN NOW Wait for him to call.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll get a phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW They will let him call you so you know what the hell is going on.  END
BEGIN NOW So you can claim responsibility for his mistakes and use whatever money you can muster to try and deal with things in court.  END
BEGIN NOW This is going to be a shitty month.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel has already decided this.  END
BEGIN NOW She is committed to this month being nothing less than a nonstop screaming match with Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW This month will not so much be peaceful.  END
BEGIN NOW She is ninety-eight percent certain of this. END
BEGIN NOW The pleasant part of the Avenue comes into view with rows of trees lining the road.  END
BEGIN NOW With restaurants and shops with fancy signs and budgets and foot traffic.  END
BEGIN NOW The money starts right around here.  END
BEGIN NOW Right after the street with the Tiki bar and the taqueria.  END
BEGIN NOW Here you will find salons with hundred dollar haircuts.  END
BEGIN NOW Jewelry stores that are always having a sale.  END
BEGIN NOW ATMs, kiosks selling vegan food, a sushi place, a skate shop, a supermarket for hippies and random hangers on.  END
BEGIN NOW Drifters and yuppies out for a morning bike ride.  END
BEGIN NOW One or two walks of shame will pass you by.  END
BEGIN NOW With faces expressing recently woken frames of reference, hangover complexions, all night parties that haven’t quite ended, bags under eyes, make up running down, eye lids struggling to deal with the brightness of it all.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel passes a book shop and coffee cart, intersections of little to no consequence.  END
BEGIN NOW Places of business not even remotely her concern right now.  END
BEGIN NOW If she can get the timing right, everything will all work out.  END
BEGIN NOW A little dawn patrol on the parking lot roof.  END
BEGIN NOW A sunrise session.  END
BEGIN NOW Then a stony backtrack to the Chev and then to Marjie’s place for some quality sister time and a nap on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a stressful morning.  END
BEGIN NOW She could use some time to recharge.  END
BEGIN NOW She could use a lot of things right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Reassurance that her life did not just go to shit and out of control.  END
BEGIN NOW That her dipshit boyfriend didn’t just ruin their retirement plans.  END
BEGIN NOW Around a corner and through an archway into a hall between Pacific and Front street.  END
BEGIN NOW  Up a few flights of stairs in a sparsely populated parking structure.  END
BEGIN NOW  Walk up the incline, find a nice chunk of concrete to perch on that’s not covered with seagull shit and spark a bowl.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch the few and far between traffic make way across the bridge to Ocean Street.  END
BEGIN NOW See the people milling about in front of the drug store.  END
BEGIN NOW Feel the sun on your skin and glaze over your eyes and sigh and breathe and listen to the chorale of a city waking up in four part harmony.  END
BEGIN NOW If your boyfriend didn’t just get arrested, this could be the start to a perfect day. END
BEGIN NOW The bowl is cached.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all ass and ashes.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel taps out on her palm, blowing the remains into a breeze.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits a minute, taking the scene in around her.  END
BEGIN NOW The green hills in the distance.  END
BEGIN NOW The streets stretching off to the shore.  END
BEGIN NOW She gets up and dusts off her backside.  END
BEGIN NOW She reaches up with her arms into the sky and tilts her neck, popping joints with satisfying little cracks and snaps.  END
BEGIN NOW She cracks her knuckles, her neck, her back, her shoulders, wrists and ankles.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel is ready to deal with today on her own terms. END
BEGIN NOW Down the staircase and back to the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Back on the sidewalk and hands in pockets and shuffle along back to the Chev with a now cold bagel soaking up cream cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW A man that’s mostly tattoos and metal ears rides a bike in circles in front of a coffee shop.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s waiting for someone, just like everyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW  Laurel walks inside and orders two large cups of black coffee to go.  END
BEGIN NOW This isn’t a cream and sugar kind of morning.  END
BEGIN NOW This is going to be an uncut caffeinated kick start of a morning, followed by a day of figuring some things out.  END
BEGIN NOW Followed by a whiskey night and a whiskey morning and we’ll see how long that’ll last. END
BEGIN NOW Two old poets are playing chess in the black metal chairs out front.  END
BEGIN NOW A shaggy boy with thick glasses carries a padded guitar case on his back.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes dart around not out of nervousness, but more so because he can’t hold them still.  END
BEGIN NOW He talks to the tattoo on the bicycle in the opposite of a library voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel passes by without alarming anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t think anyone’s noticed her coffee purchasing experience.  END
BEGIN NOW She is free to go and not interact.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the passing idea of a girl, walking with a purpose.  END
BEGIN NOW Too busy to stay and chat with the locals.  END
BEGIN NOW  The tattoo and the shag will have noticed and waited until she was a ways down the street before saying anything.  END
BEGIN NOW They will speak of her briefly in fairly flattering words.  END
BEGIN NOW Flattering for street slang and local dialect at least. END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the walk back is punctuated only by several requests for spare change or a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not even smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW Why would someone ask her for a cigarette if she wasn’t smoking? Does she look like a smoker? Does she have that air of nicotine about her? She is stoned.  END
BEGIN NOW Of that much, she is sure.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s a different breed of smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not the same.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not like the tobacco people.  END
BEGIN NOW  She doesn’t understand the allure.  END
BEGIN NOW  It’s just not her thing. END
BEGIN NOW The Chev is just where she left it.  END
BEGIN NOW No tickets.  END
BEGIN NOW No recognition.  END
BEGIN NOW No signs of tampering.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is in order.  END
BEGIN NOW  The other cup of coffee rests in the passenger seat next to the neglected bagel.  END
BEGIN NOW Hot coffee and a cold bagel.  END
BEGIN NOW At least it’s something.  END
BEGIN NOW The drive to Marjorie’s apartment is short from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Only a matter of a few blocks.  END
BEGIN NOW  Laurel parks the Chev again and walks up another flight on concrete steps.  END
BEGIN NOW She knocks on the door and waits, checking her watch.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s twelve fifteen.  END
BEGIN NOW Just about right.  END
BEGIN NOW Just after noon.  END
BEGIN NOW The door opens to Marjorie’s mess of dreadlocked hair, her closed lip grin and a pair of eyes that are all in the family.  END
BEGIN NOW She has half a hand rolled cigarette hanging between two fingers and the neck of a morning beer bottle in between the other two. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter four. END
BEGIN NOW “You fucking pothead.” END
BEGIN NOW “Morning sis! I brought you breakfast.” END
BEGIN NOW “Aw Lars, you shouldn’t have.  END
BEGIN NOW Actually, fuck that, I’m starving.  END
BEGIN NOW And I was lying about the Pop Tarts.  END
BEGIN NOW What’d you bring me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Black coffee and a bagel.” Laurel tosses the bag on the coffee table and puts down her purse. END
BEGIN NOW “Black coffee? That’ll only interrupt my beer.  END
BEGIN NOW No thanks.  END
BEGIN NOW But a bagel.  END
BEGIN NOW A bagel is perfectly reasonable.  END
BEGIN NOW Good job.  END
BEGIN NOW At least half of your efforts were not in vain.” END
BEGIN NOW “I tried.  END
BEGIN NOW You are the most difficult woman in the world to please.” END
BEGIN NOW “So not true.  END
BEGIN NOW My needs are very simple.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not rocket science.” END
BEGIN NOW “Good morning then?” END
BEGIN NOW “Very.  END
BEGIN NOW That boy had stamina.” END
BEGIN NOW “Glad to hear it.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as you’re in a good mood.” END
BEGIN NOW “So far.  END
BEGIN NOW So good.  END
BEGIN NOW Let me get you a beer and you can watch me eat and tell me all about it.” END
BEGIN NOW “I can deal with that.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like a good plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.” Laurel sinks into the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW  “I think this might have something to do with Canada.” A perfectly medium dog with perfectly medium length hair ambles up to Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW He begins licking her hand and wagging a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s a good dog.  END
BEGIN NOW She pets him absentmindedly. END
BEGIN NOW “Like the whole country of Canada? Roscoe couldn’t manage something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no way.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know how involved he is specifically.  END
BEGIN NOW I think he might just be the guy that got caught.” END
BEGIN NOW “Involved in what exactly? Selling weed across national borders? Trafficking is still serious stuff no matter where or what you’re busted for.  END
BEGIN NOW What a retard.” END
BEGIN NOW “I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I know this is way over his head.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s the past and now is now and now he’s in jail or prison or something that is certainly not home.” Marjorie cracks a bottle open and hands it to her sister.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a long heavy gulp down.  END
BEGIN NOW “I just don’t know what’s going on right now and I need to crash somewhere safe for a while.” The dog curls up to her on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW Demanding nothing and taking everything it can get. END
BEGIN NOW “Because no one will ever come looking for you at your sister’s place down the street.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s what I’m hoping.” END
BEGIN NOW “This isn’t the brightest idea you’ve ever had.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a potentially hot commodity right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m guessing that truck of yours is stuffed full of that dipshit’s devil weed.” END
BEGIN NOW “Not quite full…” END
BEGIN NOW “Either way, even with a medical card you’re way over the limit.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d say that’s one way to put it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to have to get rid of as much as I can, as fast as I can for as much money as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW  Wanna help out with the footwork?” END
BEGIN NOW “I might know a few people.  END
BEGIN NOW But seriously, everyone just grows their own here.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s too easy not too.  END
BEGIN NOW And much more profitable.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, tell me about it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Look, I’ll see what I can do to help, but I’m not making any promises.  END
BEGIN NOW In the meantime, we should look for somewhere safer for you to stay until we know more.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got some friends up north in Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure they’d be down to let a cute farm girl crash at their place.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if you come bearing gifts of green.” END
BEGIN NOW “Do I know them? I hate to intrude on a couple of strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW  I really don’t know about that.” END
BEGIN NOW “Strangers to you maybe, but these guys are solid.  END
BEGIN NOW And no one except me would ever look for you there.  END
BEGIN NOW And unless I sent you, I’d never come look for you there.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll call them later.” END
BEGIN NOW “Later? Why not now? Shouldn’t we get a move on? It’s already after noon.” END
BEGIN NOW Marjie shakes her head.  END
BEGIN NOW “These two wouldn’t be caught doing anything until at least two in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW When I say laid back guys, I mean lazy as fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW The situation is pretty much under control.” END
BEGIN NOW “I hope so.” END
BEGIN NOW “Trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW Trust your sister.  END
BEGIN NOW I can work miracles.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now, as far as you’re concerned, I’m saint fucking Jude.  END
BEGIN NOW As far as I can see, this is an easily manageable situation.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the part about keeping you safe for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest I don’t know about.  END
BEGIN NOW I kinda want the jackass to rot in jail for a while and think about what he’s done.  END
BEGIN NOW Might do him some good.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he won’t listen to Phish all the goddamn time after being in jail.  END
BEGIN NOW Better for you, better for him.” END
BEGIN NOW “Better for me… Better for him.” Laurel finishes her beer.  END
BEGIN NOW “If you say so.” END
BEGIN NOW “Besides, stay the night.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t visit enough.  END
BEGIN NOW And we can hit the bars later.  END
BEGIN NOW We haven’t been kicked out of a bar together in years.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be great.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s have some fun, get your mind off things.  END
BEGIN NOW Either that or you can stay her with Dutch and I’ll go tear things up O solo Mio.” END
BEGIN NOW “Is that what your dog’s name is? I could never remember.” END
BEGIN NOW “Short term memory loss, my dear.  END
BEGIN NOW Happens to everyone someday.” Marjorie tries to take a gulp of beer and comes up empty.  END
BEGIN NOW She eyes the bottle disapprovingly and walks to the fridge.  END
BEGIN NOW “Anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Post up here.  END
BEGIN NOW Get comfy, take a nap, take a shower.  END
BEGIN NOW You probably need both.  END
BEGIN NOW Mi casa su casa n’ shit. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Four. END
BEGIN NOW The half bum was right about holding.  END
BEGIN NOW No sense of time.  END
BEGIN NOW The constant lighting makes time as meaningless as the space between a eunuch’s legs.  END
BEGIN NOW The pale yellow light will give everything a sense of slow motion decay.  END
BEGIN NOW Of watching the inner workings of entropy wasting away on the cold hard plastic.  END
BEGIN NOW The cold hard concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW And now all alone, Roscoe hasn’t slept.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes have been closed and he’s trying to keep warm.  END
BEGIN NOW They took his jacket, his shoes, his wallet.  END
BEGIN NOW  Anything distracting.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything warm.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s cold and losing his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW  He’s miserable and just wanting something else.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s something of a bathroom in here.  END
BEGIN NOW A stainless steel can, mostly shat on, not in.  END
BEGIN NOW Moisture all around it.  END
BEGIN NOW Vomit on the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Piss on the vomit.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit all over everything else.  END
BEGIN NOW The sight and smell of the little room will only increase the urge to vomit on the shit. END
BEGIN NOW Several eternities will pass before he hears his name called.  END
BEGIN NOW He will die and come back out of the womb of wakening a few times before he hears “Maxwell, Roscoe Maxwell.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh thank god! Fucking finally!” Roscoe gets up and staggers into more fluorescent lighting.  END
BEGIN NOW Bags under eyes, skin a hanging testament to decay.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not looking sharp or well.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks like hell.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of hell that escapes from the outhouses on construction sites.  END
BEGIN NOW  He’s not anywhere near his Sunday best.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe is long unkempt hair, down to his shoulder blades.  END
BEGIN NOW He is an old tie-died shirt and acid wash jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe is in no visible condition to contest his case before anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Damn near any judge or jury would pass judgment on him within five seconds.  END
BEGIN NOW He just looks tailored for his crime.  END
BEGIN NOW A stumbling cliché of nonviolent dope dealing.  END
BEGIN NOW A hold over from several decades of leftover hippies.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe is lead into an ill lit room. END
BEGIN NOW “Sit down, sit down.” A plain clothes man tells him upon entering, motioning to one of three wood and metal chairs. END
BEGIN NOW “Have a seat; we don’t have to be here long.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s entirely up to you.” Another cop in a hat and jacket informs him.  END
BEGIN NOW “Thank god!” Roscoe exclaims. END
BEGIN NOW “Tell us about the fucking Canadians!” the plain clothes shouts at him, banging a meaty fist on the table. END
BEGIN NOW “Whoa, hey Pete, calm down.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s start this off nice and easy.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t want our boy to get uncomfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a cigarette?” The hat and jacket extracts a white cylinder from a small cardboard box. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh god, please, yes.” Roscoe doesn’t know about much aside from instant gratification. END
BEGIN NOW “But first.  END
BEGIN NOW But first.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you know about Canada?” The man with the cigarettes holds back. END
BEGIN NOW “Canada? Like north of here?” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t fucking play stupid with us cocksucker! We have evidence!” The plain clothes snarls and growls. END
BEGIN NOW “Evidence of what? Why am I here? You guys haven’t told me anything!” END
BEGIN NOW “Look, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW We can do this easy, or not so easy.  END
BEGIN NOW But we’re going to do this our way.  END
BEGIN NOW Irregardlessly.” The hat and jacket looks down on him still holding the cigarette just out of reach. END
BEGIN NOW “Irregardlessly isn’t a word.” END
BEGIN NOW “Shut the fuck up you little shit!” The plain clothes punches one of the empty chairs sending it across the room.  END
BEGIN NOW “You fucking think this is a joke? You think we’re here to be funny? Do you think this is fucking funny time you fucking piece of shit punk?” He kicks the chair for emphasis. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know what to think! I was in that horrible room for god knows how long, is it still today? When did you guys pick me up? And where’s my goddamn lawyer? When do I get my fucking phone call?!” END
BEGIN NOW “YOU’RE NOT HERE TO ASK THE FUCKING QUESTIONS SHITWAD!” The plain clothes picks the chair up and smashes it on to the interrogation room floor.  END
BEGIN NOW “I WANT SOME FUCKING ANSWERS AND I WANT THEM RIGHT FUCKING NOW!” Chair legs and splinters explode from ground zero, sending debris scattering in all directions. END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus Christ!” Roscoe is on the verge of terror.  END
BEGIN NOW Being mostly a peaceful man he hasn’t been around anything remotely like this.  END
BEGIN NOW A new kind of fear overwhelms him.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s deathly afraid he might piss himself soon.  END
BEGIN NOW His body language displays acute signs of avoidance.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s as far away from the chair and the angry man in street clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW The hat and jacket puts the cigarette in his own mouth and lights it.  END
BEGIN NOW Saying nothing. END
BEGIN NOW “TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT FUCKING CANADA! WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THE CANADIANS!?” The cop begins stomping on the chair remains, kicking and screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes a metal chair leg and begins banging on the floors and the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW Primal rage bellows from his diaphragm.  END
BEGIN NOW He is the embodiment of the term “going ape shit.” END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe is fighting with his bladder, his tear ducts, and sweat glands.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s fighting every instinct that tries to make his body leak until the threat goes away.  END
BEGIN NOW He is trying desperately to keep control over his bowels.  END
BEGIN NOW The fight is painful.  END
BEGIN NOW A war of resistance.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone is going to have to clean this room up later.  END
BEGIN NOW He will be a poor city worker, trying to find a way to land some workman’s comp and stay home with his son for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW He would rather not deal with the output from Roscoe’s body.  END
BEGIN NOW He would rather not deal with piss and shit and tears and splinters.  END
BEGIN NOW Not again. END
BEGIN NOW The plain clothes cop kicks the splinters against the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW He picks up the other chair and slams it against the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He howls wildly.  END
BEGIN NOW His mouth is foaming, his pupils dilated.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes wide with rage.  END
BEGIN NOW The hat and jacket stands in the corner shaking his head and rolling his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s seen this scene before.  END
BEGIN NOW He is neither impressed nor intimidated.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete really gets into his work. END
BEGIN NOW “Look, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW The sooner you start talking, the sooner we can get out of here and you can go back to whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Or Pete over there can mess up your chair next.  END
BEGIN NOW He might take you along with it.  END
BEGIN NOW He gets a little carried away sometimes.” The hat and jacket flicks ashes indiscriminately. END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe starts cracking.  END
BEGIN NOW “They found me! Ok!? They found me at one of the co-ops and asked me for an exclusive deal.  END
BEGIN NOW They were ready to pay cash.  END
BEGIN NOW  That’s all I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to ask questions… I don’t want to ask questions… I don’t… want…” END
BEGIN NOW The hat and jacket removes his hat, becoming just a jacket smoking a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW “So you admit you know the Canadians? And you did business with them?” He says this holding out a brand new never before smoked cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW “Y- Yes.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah… I admit it.  END
BEGIN NOW Was it really that serious? Just selling to Canada?” END
BEGIN NOW “Son,” the Jacket says, “Son, when it comes to Canada, everything is serious.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter five. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere between California and Oregon.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere there’s a spot on the side of the road with two old shoes, rotting away next to a broken cell phone in the weeds.  END
BEGIN NOW The trees will continue growing.  END
BEGIN NOW The wind will continue blowing.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a place of constant transitions.  END
BEGIN NOW Right between A and B.  END
BEGIN NOW You will neither be here nor there when you are between.  END
BEGIN NOW Parked dead center on the line, dissected in half on the border, is an old van, with one occupant.  END
BEGIN NOW In front of the driver there is a current newspaper.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a marker ready to draw circles.  END
BEGIN NOW  He’s reading the obituaries over carefully.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sometimes he circles them.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he doesn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s reading by the dashboard light.  END
BEGIN NOW He has the local papers from five different counties on either side of the boarder.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s looking for specific details of the death.  END
BEGIN NOW Details that concern exactly how the person died.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone die from gang violence? Next.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone die from drunk driving, drowning, routine Darwinism? Sorry, not interested.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone dead because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time, because they made a bad decision, or took a wrong turn? Not my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone die from strange unexplainable ways, maybe and including involvement by aliens, governments, international conspiracies and slash or various religious organizations?  No.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hell no.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even close to what we’re looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW  Anyone have a long struggle with cancer of the lungs, brain, breasts, throat, etc? Oh, he makes a circle.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that’s very interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell me more. END
BEGIN NOW Spencer Raleigh draws a circle around an obituary that marks the time and place of the funeral.  END
BEGIN NOW It will take place in two days about three miles from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Friends and family encouraged to attend.  END
BEGIN NOW  Vernon Quimby, age seventy four.  END
BEGIN NOW Survived by his wife, son and daughter, Quimby fought with cancer for seven years.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw his son be fruitful and multiply.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw his daughter bare crotch fruit.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw bombs dropping, He saw bullets flying.  END
BEGIN NOW He watched his friends being assassinated, presidents getting shot.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw riots in the streets, police state tactics used on the dissenting citizens of the land of the free.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw a lot of nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW During his final days he shook his head at a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW  Because he was dying.  END
BEGIN NOW And there were still a lot of stupid people doing stupid things for stupid reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW  Quimby’s disposition at the moment of his death could be called dissatisfaction.  END
BEGIN NOW Disappointment at his fellow human beings acting like complete savages towards each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Believing totally in their own bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW Quimby did not die with a smile on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW The look on Quimby’s face at the moment of death was something more like distain. END
BEGIN NOW Spencer taps the marker on his head for a minute, looking for other candidates.  END
BEGIN NOW There was an old woman that looked likely, but that was it.  END
BEGIN NOW Slow weekend.  END
BEGIN NOW At least for cancer research.  END
BEGIN NOW At least for progressive, boarder line illegal cancer research.  END
BEGIN NOW He bites on the inside of his lips, trying to plan a trip between two towns on the same day.  END
BEGIN NOW Just after the funeral, when the dirt is fairly fresh.  END
BEGIN NOW  Gas cost, traffic conditions at the projected time of arrival.  END
BEGIN NOW Etc.  END
BEGIN NOW Planning and plotting.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence looks straight ahead as far as his headlights can see.  END
BEGIN NOW He produces a tin canister and crumbles a small bit of dried marijuana onto the news paper.  END
BEGIN NOW Then a pouch of tobacco.  END
BEGIN NOW He rolls a small spliff and smokes until there’s nothing left but roach. END
BEGIN NOW The trees are thick with old growth.  END
BEGIN NOW The shadows long and impenetrable.  END
BEGIN NOW This is nothing like the Texas border.  END
BEGIN NOW All dirt and more dirt and flat lands.  END
BEGIN NOW Always crossing the light in the dead of night, looking for tomorrow’s work.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence has been at this job for over half a year now.  END
BEGIN NOW All along the old Route 66.  END
BEGIN NOW No longer called that, now just another highway.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another collection of run down gas stations and diners with boarded up windows.  END
BEGIN NOW  Dust on dust along a road full of pot holes.  END
BEGIN NOW An antique show, showcasing bygone eras.  END
BEGIN NOW Trailer parks and tract houses.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not much in the way of tourism any more.  END
BEGIN NOW A few old communities still exist around these parts.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly paint chip facades and termite reservations.  END
BEGIN NOW A few old churches, built with old wood on cracked foundations.  END
BEGIN NOW Old churches with just the right kind of faulty wiring. END
BEGIN NOW The scene was old Chicago.  END
BEGIN NOW The outskirts where the industry is.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoke stacks and factories.  END
BEGIN NOW Warehouses and trucks up and down the streets at all hours.  END
BEGIN NOW  Spencer Raleigh is five years old.  END
BEGIN NOW His father’s been gone for four of those years.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy spends most of his time at the public library.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother spends her time working, paying rent, paying bills.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to keep a sandwich in her son’s mouth and the water running.  END
BEGIN NOW Just maintain.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just keep trying.  END
BEGIN NOW Something will pay off.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep scratching those lottery tickets.  END
BEGIN NOW Something will come through.  END
BEGIN NOW A rich relative will die someday.  END
BEGIN NOW Just keep waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW Survive. END
BEGIN NOW Spence as a boy has learned to read well enough.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s most of his time.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t do school in the normal sense.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t do classes and teachers and homework.  END
BEGIN NOW He has his boy’s mind and his curiosity.  END
BEGIN NOW He has all the time in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW And books about damn near everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The librarians know him by name and tolerate his presence.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother they don’t know what to think of.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother with haggard expression, tired eyes, wild hair.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother that drops the boy off in the morning and picks him up just before closing.  END
BEGIN NOW The boy sits small in large wooden chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW A stack of books picked out for their pretty covers and fascinating titles.  END
BEGIN NOW Books by the likes of Hakim Bay and Noam Chomsky.  END
BEGIN NOW Books about politics and science.  END
BEGIN NOW Religion and anti-religion.  END
BEGIN NOW He read conspiracy theories.  END
BEGIN NOW  He read and re-read Illuminatus! Between the ages of seven and twelve he read that book twenty three times.  END
BEGIN NOW  He devoured books by Tim Leary, Bob Wilson, and Richard Dawkins.  END
BEGIN NOW His childhood was marked by self education.  END
BEGIN NOW He learned about the idea of god as an idea, not so much as an actual entity.  END
BEGIN NOW He learned about the function of the state and the function of the individual.  END
BEGIN NOW  Most importantly he learned never to trust anyone except himself.  END
BEGIN NOW  And even then it was a fifty-fifty situation. END
BEGIN NOW That was all the serious stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW For fun, when his mind wasn’t busy expanding rapidly, absorbing and developing logical reasoning at an astounding pace, he read books about card games, thought puzzles, problem solving.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no one around to consider Spencer a prodigy.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother usually responded to his inquiries and statements with a robotic, “That’s nice dear.” She was busy keeping the machine going.  END
BEGIN NOW She was busy pushing all the right buttons and pulling all the right levers.  END
BEGIN NOW Just enough to keep a loaf of bread around.  END
BEGIN NOW A jar of peanut butter.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe some jam if times were good. END
BEGIN NOW Aside from the librarians and his mother, Spencer’s human contact was fairly limited.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he would tire of the library and wander around the streets of rural Chicago.  END
BEGIN NOW He would hear and smell and see the things that could only be happening just outside of a major city.  END
BEGIN NOW Where all the poor people live.  END
BEGIN NOW On either side of the tracks.  END
BEGIN NOW Rich people don’t live near the train.  END
BEGIN NOW The noise drives them crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW The vibrations of the freighters irritates them to levels of irrationality.  END
BEGIN NOW Boxcars, more boxcars.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer as a boy would sit near the tracks and try counting them.  END
BEGIN NOW He would count the number of boxcars that passed during a given hour on a certain day of the week and write the number down in his journal.  END
BEGIN NOW He would return, weeks, months later.  END
BEGIN NOW Same day of the week and check the numbers for consistency.  END
BEGIN NOW He had all the time in the world. END
BEGIN NOW He would wander the streets and hear the music played out on the boom boxes and pouring out of houses, the nightclubs, the passing Chevrolets.  END
BEGIN NOW He came to love the noise, the constant hubbub and lights.  END
BEGIN NOW The sirens, the strobes, the headlights.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone coming and going and staying the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Fluctuating constants.  END
BEGIN NOW  Spencer was the cities’ child.  END
BEGIN NOW In the front seat of the van, Spencer the adult cracks a beer.  END
BEGIN NOW He cracks the beer with both hands.  END
BEGIN NOW He listens to the last unique sound break the dead of night silence half way between Oregon and California. END
BEGIN NOW “Shitballs.” Spencer says after taking a long swig.  END
BEGIN NOW He gives a long, drawn out exhale.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of him waking up while another part is falling asleep.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, ok.” He thinks out loud.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no one around to tell him that he’s talking to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, so let’s see.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s see.  END
BEGIN NOW Where are we… and we need a few hours for regroup, rest and relax.  END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow, work starts at noon and then skips two towns down and begins again at three thirty.” He drinks again from the beer.  END
BEGIN NOW “That should give me just enough time.” END
BEGIN NOW Spencer turns on the radio and scans the stations.  END
BEGIN NOW He scans through static until he hears a bass line and an echoing guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW Mood music.  END
BEGIN NOW Just what he needs.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns the keys in the ignition and begins driving south into California.  END
BEGIN NOW The tune is Soul Man as recorded by Sam and Dave. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter six: END
BEGIN NOW The drive from Santa Cruz to Berkeley takes anywhere from an hour to an hour and a half.  END
BEGIN NOW Highway Seventeen winds it’s way over the hill and into the sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW South Bay to North, all four lanes or more.  END
BEGIN NOW The commuters and carpoolers.  END
BEGIN NOW Lanes of highway deep with traffic.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone with a place to be.  END
BEGIN NOW The Chev makes due.  END
BEGIN NOW Taking the curves as an old timer can.  END
BEGIN NOW Maintaining.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel smokes a joint and takes the sun into account through rose colored shades.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes the towering building letting her know she’s about to enter San Jose.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes through Santa Clara and keeps going.  END
BEGIN NOW Her foot barely varies in pressure on the gas pedal.  END
BEGIN NOW  The buildings get thicker, the concrete becomes more pervasive.  END
BEGIN NOW The road stretches on in all directions.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks again at the map and scrawling her sister made before she left this morning. END
BEGIN NOW “You sure these guys are going to be a good idea?” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW These guys would not worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d just deal.  END
BEGIN NOW And that sounds like a great idea for you right about now.” END
BEGIN NOW “I just don’t know Marj.  END
BEGIN NOW This is kinda weird.  END
BEGIN NOW What the fuck am I supposed to say?  Are they even expecting me? Did you call them?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, I didn’t call.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll be cool with it.  END
BEGIN NOW They like surprises.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be welcome.  END
BEGIN NOW Just trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m your older sister.  END
BEGIN NOW  I’m here to help.” END
BEGIN NOW That was all she left with.  END
BEGIN NOW Words of wisdom from the elder.  END
BEGIN NOW Go my child and seek the safe house.  END
BEGIN NOW They will look after you while you figure out your next move.  END
BEGIN NOW Fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Just great.  END
BEGIN NOW Shack up with a couple of strangers.  END
BEGIN NOW No doubt a couple of fucking hippies.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah well.  END
BEGIN NOW Hippies are better than nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, they might be able to help with business.  END
BEGIN NOW Moving a little weight.  END
BEGIN NOW Buying a little weight themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Might not be so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW This could be a good thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Think positive Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep your thoughts on the bright side of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Just look ahead and don’t worry about things you can’t fix right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is going to be fine. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel pulls off the intersection.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes the exit indicated and continues until she sees the cross street.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes one loop around the block before seeing the right street and makes a turn.  END
BEGIN NOW She parks her car and takes a long look at the apartment complex.  END
BEGIN NOW A black metal gate blocks everything in.  END
BEGIN NOW It should be one of those automatic car gates that slides in and out to let the occupants park their cars.  END
BEGIN NOW The gate is broken open.  END
BEGIN NOW Permanently slide in.  END
BEGIN NOW She eyes this a little cautiously.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely on her guard in foreign territory.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks up to apartment fifteen and knocks twice, pauses and knocks three more times. END
BEGIN NOW From within noises of struggle emanate.  END
BEGIN NOW Wrestling with something and grunts and groans.  END
BEGIN NOW Things falling over, the clatter of empty cans, the rustle of papers.  END
BEGIN NOW The distinct sound of a lighter and then a man coughing violently.  END
BEGIN NOW The door swings open in one swift motion, exposing two strangers to each other in the most dramatic of fashions.  END
BEGIN NOW  A man in only shorts stands half hunched in the door way.  END
BEGIN NOW A cigarette dangles out of his mouth and his eyes are bloodshot beyond redemption.  END
BEGIN NOW His hair can’t make up its mind.  END
BEGIN NOW  Deciding on all directions simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs at you standing in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW “Aha! Ha ha! About fuckin’ time!” He walks away leaving the door open.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel stands there.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely unsure about everything that just happened.  END
BEGIN NOW  The man with multiple personality scalp crawls back into bed, a mattress in the corner of the living room.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulls a blanket over himself and starts falling back asleep, still smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well, come in for chrissakes.” He says with eyes closed.  END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t just stand there.  END
BEGIN NOW Put your things inside, sit on the couch, whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Just come in, come in.” He flicks the ash into a tray a few inches away. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks at the inside of the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a desk and some chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW A low table.  END
BEGIN NOW The mattress.  END
BEGIN NOW The aforementioned couch.  END
BEGIN NOW Bottles and cans are all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Every available surface has been painted.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the furniture is broken in some place, but not entirely.  END
BEGIN NOW There are at least three ashtrays with in visibility.  END
BEGIN NOW A large American flag hangs between the small kitchen and the living room.  END
BEGIN NOW  It hangs on five rings suspended on a rod like a shower curtain.  END
BEGIN NOW The lines on all the stars have been drawn in, making pentagrams out of a spangled banner.  END
BEGIN NOW Beggars, she’s thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW Beggars can’t be choosers.  END
BEGIN NOW  But these guys seems pretty tolerant.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t even know me.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a step inside, bracing herself for something to come jumping out at her.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing happens.  END
BEGIN NOW The man on the mattress takes another inhale and lets it waft out of his open mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW After both feet are through the door she feels much more comfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW This will be a pretty relaxed stay.  END
BEGIN NOW She can tell that no one is going to be demanding anything from her.  END
BEGIN NOW But she’s welcome to do as she pleases.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks around at the walls covered in scraps of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW In doodles and words.  END
BEGIN NOW A collage of the collective brain power of two strange men with time and writing utensils. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a small hallway and what looks like a restroom at the end.  END
BEGIN NOW She does need to pee.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s about that time.  END
BEGIN NOW She closes the door and see another ashtray.  END
BEGIN NOW Right by the can.  END
BEGIN NOW She washes up and and reenters the living room.  END
BEGIN NOW The man is passed out, the cigarette extinguished.  END
BEGIN NOW Only his snoring is heard.  END
BEGIN NOW She figures she might as well move the bags inside.  END
BEGIN NOW This can’t be that bad. END
BEGIN NOW The bags all inside and Laurel on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW She rests her head and closes her eyes and rests a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW  There’s a red hash pipe on the table in front of her.  END
BEGIN NOW She figures, why not? She packs a bowl and sparks it, getting a bit more stoned than she was on arrival.  END
BEGIN NOW The door in the hallway opens soon afterward.  END
BEGIN NOW A mess walks out, scratching his ass and proceeds directly into the bathroom.  END
BEGIN NOW He pisses enthusiastically with the door wide open.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears a sudden coughing coming from the living room couch.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh ho! When did that get here? Good morning, good morning!” The mess walks out under a beard and sleepy eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW  He sees a girl sitting on the couch with a bowl to her lips and the roommate asleep on the mattress in the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs at her.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs all the way into the kitchen and opens the fridge, extracting a cold beer.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel has been laughed at twice in the last fifteen minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds this a strange kind of hello, nice to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW “Wanna beer?” The mess tosses her one before she answers.  END
BEGIN NOW “Good, have a beer.  END
BEGIN NOW Beer for breakfast never did no one no harm.” He wipes head from his face.  END
BEGIN NOW He throws one at the man on the mattress and it hits his stomach, jolting him awake. END
BEGIN NOW “We can sleep later.  END
BEGIN NOW We have a guest.  END
BEGIN NOW How about food? How about Hamm’s and eggs? Hamm’s and eggs it is.” The mess walks back into the kitchen and begins cleaning a pan and turning the stove on.  END
BEGIN NOW He gets out eggs and butter and more beer.  END
BEGIN NOW He scratches his balls and chest, cracking eggs into a healthy dollop of melting butter.  END
BEGIN NOW The man on the mattress cracks his beer and takes a mean guzzle.  END
BEGIN NOW He drinks and drinks and ends with a loud belch. END
BEGIN NOW “Woo! That’s so much better than coffee.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tell me about it.  END
BEGIN NOW How do you like your eggs?” END
BEGIN NOW “Cooked.” The man on the mattress belches again. END
BEGIN NOW “Not you! The guest.  END
BEGIN NOW The guest on the couch that doesn’t speak.  END
BEGIN NOW She might be a mute.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope she’s deaf, she has no idea we’re talking about her and eggs right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d get that pipe out of her hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be dangerous.  END
BEGIN NOW Investigate.” END
BEGIN NOW “I can hear and speak just fine.” Laurel says. END
BEGIN NOW “Good lord it talks!” The mess giggles to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW “So guest, what brings you about?” END
BEGIN NOW “Umm, my sister told me to see you guys for some reason.” END
BEGIN NOW “You have a sister? That’s fantastic.” The mattress man shakes his can, listening to the last undrinkable drops clattering in the bowels of an aluminum beer container.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter how many times you tilt the can and try to get that last bit out, the drops will be there.  END
BEGIN NOW Dancing away in the bottom of the can.  END
BEGIN NOW Dancing a dance of mockery.  END
BEGIN NOW “Re-beer!” He calls towards the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW “Re-beer!” The response comes back in form of a flying can caught and cracked. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I have a sister.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s from Santa Cruz.  END
BEGIN NOW I think you guys know her.” END
BEGIN NOW “The plot thickens.  END
BEGIN NOW Excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW Does your sister have name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Most people call her Marjorie, or Marji.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything along those lines.” END
BEGIN NOW “M-Unit! Fuck yeah! How is the old girl doing?” END
BEGIN NOW “You know.  END
BEGIN NOW She maintains.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s pretty much the same.” END
BEGIN NOW “So, M-Unit’s sister, what brings you to our humble couch?” END
BEGIN NOW “Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW Call me Laurel.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright Lars,” The mess throws an empty can at the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW “What’s your story? And stop parking, that’s terribly rude.” END
BEGIN NOW Laurel passes the pipe to the man on the mattress.  END
BEGIN NOW He squints at her with rambling eyes, taking in two beers and premature wakefulness.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks like a man in a state of shambles.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks like the end of misled youth.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes the pipe and sparks with a Bic, taking the long inhale to the point of no return.  END
BEGIN NOW He lets the cloud out slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW He gestures wildly with the pipe towards the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW The mess with the pan takes it and continues where the shambles left off, pulling deep into the lungs.  END
BEGIN NOW He exhales and hands it back to Laurel. END
BEGIN NOW The pipe back in her hands she starts retelling her story.  END
BEGIN NOW The story isn’t terribly long.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t know a whole lot of the details.  END
BEGIN NOW But it takes a while.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a little stoned right now.  END
BEGIN NOW When she comes back around there’s a paper plate with two eggs in front of her, a fresh beer and toast with jam.  END
BEGIN NOW The mess and the shambles have already eaten and look at her inquisitively.  END
BEGIN NOW “That’s it?” The shambles says smoking again. END
BEGIN NOW “That’s brings us up to now at least.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think it’s quite done yet.  END
BEGIN NOW But yeah, I’d prefer not to be around my house for a while until I know what’s going on with Roscoe.” Laurel takes not so much a dainty sip from her can of Hamm’s. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, you know whatever works.  END
BEGIN NOW If you need a place to crash, I think we can oblige.” The shambles takes to blowing smoke rings and leaning against the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW “But let’s see.  END
BEGIN NOW Do we have any plans?” The shambles looks at the mess and they start laughing in low voices. END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, ok.  END
BEGIN NOW But seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW Should be fine.  END
BEGIN NOW I really don’t see why not.  END
BEGIN NOW You seem pretty chill.  END
BEGIN NOW And you’re M-Unit’s sister.  END
BEGIN NOW That makes you pretty cool by association.  END
BEGIN NOW  And pretty, cool people are always welcome here.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry.  END
BEGIN NOW Take your time.  END
BEGIN NOW Also this is fantastic weed.” The shambles blows two perfect rings towards the ceiling. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh the weed! That’s right.  END
BEGIN NOW I might need to get rid of a lot of it.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, for financial purposes.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting the boy out of jail or something.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? Could be lawyers and all kinds of trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW But yeah, I think I need to sell some weed for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Know anyone that wants to buy?” END
BEGIN NOW “Off the top of my head, most of the people I know.” The mess lights a cigarette and washes his mouth out with beer.  END
BEGIN NOW “Besides, students all over this place.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of weed in town already but always room for more.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure we can unload some of it for you.  END
BEGIN NOW How much are you looking to get rid of?” END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe fifty pounds?” END
BEGIN NOW The guys in the room look stunned.  END
BEGIN NOW They both stare at nothing in particular for a full minute. END
BEGIN NOW “Did you just say fifty pounds?” The shambles has ashed on his pants and doesn’t particularly care. END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus.”  The mess continues staring. END
BEGIN NOW “Well Lars, that’s a lot to get rid of quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless we can find a buyer that takes large amounts.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the guys we know buy in dimes or dubs or eighths.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe one or two guys that want the odd ounce or two.  END
BEGIN NOW But mostly, it’s small fries.  END
BEGIN NOW  But I’ll make a few phone calls.  END
BEGIN NOW Something will come up.” The shambles snubs out a butt and sits back with a sigh.  END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, are we going to be drug dealers for a while?” END
BEGIN NOW “I think so, dude.  END
BEGIN NOW This is going to be awesome.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s righteous.” END
BEGIN NOW Laurel takes a look around the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no television.  END
BEGIN NOW No radio.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot of paper and books and ashtrays.  END
BEGIN NOW “Man.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys live like monks here.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ha! If this is monasticism, then god help us.” The mess throws another empty can at the wall close to the trash box. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter seven; END
BEGIN NOW There’s something about the houses of geriatrics.  END
BEGIN NOW The smell is something that always lingers.  END
BEGIN NOW It will always smell old in the home of an old person.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be a dull smell.  END
BEGIN NOW Not quite like rot, but close to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Not quite like stagnation, or the smell of dead dreams hidden in the closet.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be a smell of decay, gradual and slightly off putting.  END
BEGIN NOW  Something a long time coming towards death, but not there yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people erroneously contribute this to mothballs.  END
BEGIN NOW But they are wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW It is the smell of someone fading away.  END
BEGIN NOW The sense of smell triggers memory better than any other sense a human has.  END
BEGIN NOW The sense of smell is also dulled by familiarity easier than the other senses.  END
BEGIN NOW  Juniper notices nothing unusual about the smell of her home.  END
BEGIN NOW She has walked the halls and lingered in the kitchen long enough never to notice anything about it ever again.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper Marie Gladstone was born in nineteen twenty three.  END
BEGIN NOW She was born the year of Mailer, the year of Kissinger.  END
BEGIN NOW She has seen the great depression.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole of the Second World War.  END
BEGIN NOW The Vietnam War.  END
BEGIN NOW The Korean War, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s no stranger to conflicts coming from the TV screen.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper has seen the world being torn apart and rebuilt time and again.  END
BEGIN NOW She was around before antidepressants, when birth control as a pill was just an idea, when attention deficit disorder wasn’t even a vague notion in the minds of the therapists and school consolers.  END
BEGIN NOW By her own account she had lived a full, rich life. END
BEGIN NOW Jun never needed to see a shrink when her husband died.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t need more help than her friends could offer.  END
BEGIN NOW All she needed was the comfort that god would take care of things.  END
BEGIN NOW She went to church and prayed for her husband.  END
BEGIN NOW She prayed that the bills would be paid on time, that the retirement fund would never run dry.  END
BEGIN NOW She prayed that god had a plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Jun’s plan was god’s plan.  END
BEGIN NOW She could sleep peacefully because of this.  END
BEGIN NOW Jun went to church every Sunday to ensure that god would be on her side.  END
BEGIN NOW She would plead and beg and ask sincerely for god’s attention and mercy.  END
BEGIN NOW Her husband was still dead.  END
BEGIN NOW The house still reeked of loneliness.  END
BEGIN NOW Those were two constants in Jun’s life.  END
BEGIN NOW Two things that could never be changed.  END
BEGIN NOW In the musty dining room of her ranch house, somewhere in the middle of suburbia, Midwest, Juniper sips her tea and looks out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW She watches the autumn rains smack against the window panes and stares outside, taking gradual sips of perfectly brewed Jasmine tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Normally should would have made cookies to go with her tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Today, however she was not expecting company and the rains would ensure no unexpected guests would drop by.  END
BEGIN NOW When she was alone there was no need for cookies.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, with the way her back has been acting up her doctor said any unnecessary bending over should be avoided.  END
BEGIN NOW So much for opening ovens.  END
BEGIN NOW This suited her just fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Her tea would keep her company.  END
BEGIN NOW Her tea and the rain were the only companions she needed right now. END
BEGIN NOW In her younger days, before the back pain, before Robert passed away and left her the house and the old Volkswagen that since remained parked in the driveway.  END
BEGIN NOW In her younger days she loved to walk around on days like this.  END
BEGIN NOW Days when the rain wasn’t a storm, but wasn’t a sprinkle.  END
BEGIN NOW When it was just enough to soak you to the bone but not so bad that you caught a cold.  END
BEGIN NOW Robert had taught her about these days.  END
BEGIN NOW As a child she never ventured out in supposedly ill weather.  END
BEGIN NOW Robert taught her that the weather wasn’t ill, that was just her silly ideas being stamped on the weather.  END
BEGIN NOW Weather was always neutral.  END
BEGIN NOW The weather had no concept of good or bad or harmful or beneficial.  END
BEGIN NOW The rain fell regardless.  END
BEGIN NOW These days she rarely went outside except on Sundays.  END
BEGIN NOW And then it was primarily to go to church and back.  END
BEGIN NOW Back to church in the evening for bingo and town gossip.  END
BEGIN NOW The gossip mostly centered around other people’s children.  END
BEGIN NOW She was always fascinated by the goings on of other people’s kids, having none of her own.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that she didn’t want children.  END
BEGIN NOW  Not that she didn’t try.  END
BEGIN NOW But there were always problems.  END
BEGIN NOW Something always prevented her from conceiving.  END
BEGIN NOW But that was a long time ago and by now she was very much over the idea.  END
BEGIN NOW She was much too old to be fussing over the idea of children.  END
BEGIN NOW She was content to live vicariously through the other women of the town.  END
BEGIN NOW The younger women troubled her.  END
BEGIN NOW Their children always seemed so beyond control.  END
BEGIN NOW Always running about, causing ruckus and noise and getting into the strangest kind of trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW Trouble that made no sense to Juniper.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids these days with their privileges.  END
BEGIN NOW Kids with phones they could carry around in their pockets.  END
BEGIN NOW Goodness, when she was a girl what she wouldn’t have given for a portable telephone.  END
BEGIN NOW  Not to mention how they always seemed to be listening to music, everywhere they went.  END
BEGIN NOW To be able to listen to music independently of records or cassette tapes.  END
BEGIN NOW  Even those new CDs seemed like some kind of space age fantasy.  END
BEGIN NOW And now they needed nothing except a small metal box that could fit in a pocket.  END
BEGIN NOW Right next to their phones.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s heard rumors that even the phones are able to play music  ow.  END
BEGIN NOW But she doesn’t believe it. END
BEGIN NOW Jun marveled at these things but never interacted.  END
BEGIN NOW She never inquired or bothered to catch up as the young mothers at church had.  END
BEGIN NOW She was not interested in being part of this modern age.  END
BEGIN NOW  She possessed no inclination to try and understand what any of it meant.  END
BEGIN NOW  Where it was all going.  END
BEGIN NOW She missed having Robert around.  END
BEGIN NOW  He would have known what to do.  END
BEGIN NOW He would have explained this strange phenomenon to her in a way that pacified and calmed her into accepting and remaining detached.  END
BEGIN NOW He was so good at that.  END
BEGIN NOW She met Robert for the second time when he came home from the Navy.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a handsome man walking into town with an army issue duffel bag, a clean hair cut and a sincere smile that was slightly condescending.  END
BEGIN NOW Like he knew something that no one else did and was going to keep his secrets.  END
BEGIN NOW And how he looked in that uniform.  END
BEGIN NOW All fit and tanned from hours in the sun on one of those humungous boats with all those guns out in the Pacific.  END
BEGIN NOW Robert said that war was a very silly thing.  END
BEGIN NOW That was the most she ever got out of him.  END
BEGIN NOW A very silly thing to be involved in. END
BEGIN NOW When he returned to the small town he grew up in he met Juniper when she was teaching the younger grades at the elementary school.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her hair was bright auburn then.  END
BEGIN NOW She wore it up in a bun so as not to succumb to vanity.  END
BEGIN NOW She did love her hair.  END
BEGIN NOW When Robert and Juniper met it was an over cast day and they were the only two people in the post office.  END
BEGIN NOW He was picking up a check and she was writing her parents, telling them how wonderful small town life was, and how she was so fulfilled teaching the next generation of children about the geography of the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW Only half of her letter was full of lies.  END
BEGIN NOW Robert had just been hired to work for the local newspaper, covering sports and human interests.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t exactly love at first sight.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially since they had met before when they were in high school.  END
BEGIN NOW Back then, he was a track star.  END
BEGIN NOW Back then, she was a bookworm.  END
BEGIN NOW  Always watching from a distance.  END
BEGIN NOW Now as two adults.  END
BEGIN NOW Now seeing each other again for the very first time.  END
BEGIN NOW It was one of those moments that belongs with graceful cello music accompanied by bright violins and maybe a small brass section.  END
BEGIN NOW The background music would be uplifting.  END
BEGIN NOW The background music will make your heart race and your chest swell.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be in a state of attention and affection when you listen to the background music for the moment that Robert and Juniper met for the second time. END
BEGIN NOW The winter would be coming soon.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper stares at the rain and drinks her tea.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing quite like a good cup of tea on a rainy day.  END
BEGIN NOW She was proud of her tea.  END
BEGIN NOW She made it very well.  END
BEGIN NOW She bought the delicate imported stuff when it was on sale.  END
BEGIN NOW She was very proud of her tea.  END
BEGIN NOW  Juniper thought of tea as something that should be graceful.  END
BEGIN NOW Graceful like the dancers in those old movies.  END
BEGIN NOW That Fred Astaire.  END
BEGIN NOW He sure could dance.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper would, in her younger days, dream of dancing in those elegant dresses.  END
BEGIN NOW Dresses that seemed to make the woman underneath an ethereal spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW Moving with unfettered grace.  END
BEGIN NOW Moving around a stage like the taste of perfectly brewed tea. END
BEGIN NOW The rain continued to fall.  END
BEGIN NOW Completely unwavering.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper Gladstone continued looking out the window, lost in her dining room.  END
BEGIN NOW Unconcerned with whether or not the weather would change.  END
BEGIN NOW Unconcerned in general.  END
BEGIN NOW She sipped and she sat.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinking quietly to herself. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Eight. END
BEGIN NOW It was one of those towns.  END
BEGIN NOW Where the men drank the cheap wine and the women drank the cheaper wine.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer’s van had two new occupants.  END
BEGIN NOW  A male and a female.  END
BEGIN NOW Both of them not much for conversation. END
BEGIN NOW “Well,” Spencer talks to his guests, “Well, looks like we’re going to be stuck with each other for a few hours and might as well get to know each other.” He looks at two of the newspapers where had drawn circles.  END
BEGIN NOW “Mr… Quimby?  Quimby right? You seem like you lived a pretty full life.  END
BEGIN NOW Body’s in good shape for an old man.  END
BEGIN NOW Put on some meat, probably had a decent wife.  END
BEGIN NOW  Took care a ya in your old age.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir.  END
BEGIN NOW Well now.  END
BEGIN NOW You have been called to a higher purpose.  END
BEGIN NOW Hopefully somewhere in your freshly exhumed body we can find out how to prevent the deaths of thousands.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d be a hero in spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW But no one will ever know your name.  END
BEGIN NOW  Except me.” Spencer is parked on the far side of the cemetery.  END
BEGIN NOW He used to park closer but ever since he bought the wheel chair, life has been pretty easy.  END
BEGIN NOW  Today he wheeled Mr.  END
BEGIN NOW Quimby around, taking a good look at many headstones and crypts.  END
BEGIN NOW Spotting the differences in the rich dead and the poor dead.  END
BEGIN NOW “See, that’s real marble on that stone.  END
BEGIN NOW Family had some money.  END
BEGIN NOW But it’s not too large and not so small.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was a modest man from a modestly rich family.  END
BEGIN NOW A real middle grounder.  END
BEGIN NOW But down there.  END
BEGIN NOW That big fucker, with the pillars.  END
BEGIN NOW That dude had some bank.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulled some weight, believe you me.” Quimby said nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW  He sat slumped in the wheel chair.  END
BEGIN NOW His head bobbing up and down with roll of things.  END
BEGIN NOW A few smudges of dirt in the places Spence had to touch him while loading him up.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think it would be easy to stand out in a cemetery in broad daylight.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think someone would notice you digging up a corpse just after noon when the sun was shining.  END
BEGIN NOW But you’d be wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW If you wear a uniform while you do all of this, no one will ask questions.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just doing your job.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone can tell.  END
BEGIN NOW Because you wear a uniform.  END
BEGIN NOW  You make the task of digging up six feet of dirt look like the pain in the ass that it is.  END
BEGIN NOW You hit a coffin.  END
BEGIN NOW Uncover half of the top.  END
BEGIN NOW Just enough to open it and extract the body.  END
BEGIN NOW Pull the old bastard out.  END
BEGIN NOW Prop him up in the chair.  END
BEGIN NOW Give him a blanket over his legs.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice wide brimmed hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Give him the FDR treatment.  END
BEGIN NOW Close the casket, and pile all that dirt back in.  END
BEGIN NOW No one needs to know.  END
BEGIN NOW Then just wheel someone around for a while and load them into the van whenever you’re ready.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW Spencer looks in the back of the van and sees two body bags.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing except him is moving or making a sound.  END
BEGIN NOW He sighs and lights a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost time to make the phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW Set up an extraction point.  END
BEGIN NOW  Those guys like the bodies as fresh as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW The less decay the better.  END
BEGIN NOW All those valuable cancer cells.  END
BEGIN NOW The middle man for this operation was one of the most useful sons of bitches Spence ever met.  END
BEGIN NOW He could get just about anyone in touch with anyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW He was the great connecter.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was the go to guy for any kind of business.  END
BEGIN NOW Need to get rid of something? Just a phone call away.  END
BEGIN NOW Need to get out of the country? Need a new identity? It can be arranged.  END
BEGIN NOW  The guy in between would always be there.  END
BEGIN NOW  Right between you and what you need.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s his domain.  END
BEGIN NOW And he plays all the right hands. END
BEGIN NOW “House Party Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW My man, my man.” END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Spence.  END
BEGIN NOW Right on time.  END
BEGIN NOW The Northerners are looking for you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Figured they would be.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got a couple of cold ones for ‘em.” END
BEGIN NOW “Excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW Whereabouts are you this time?” END
BEGIN NOW “Bumfuck, NorCal.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m think I’m thirty miles outside Eureka.  END
BEGIN NOW  Give or take.” END
BEGIN NOW “Give or take what?” END
BEGIN NOW “About thirty miles.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, if you make it to Eureka by seven.  END
BEGIN NOW Ish.  END
BEGIN NOW I can have a guy meet you at the Motel Six Hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW  Room number…” He pauses, searching for a scrap of paper, “ah, room number sixty six.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sweet.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I can manage that.  END
BEGIN NOW Sevenish.  END
BEGIN NOW That should be more than enough time.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, it would take you like an hour at most to get there.  END
BEGIN NOW You are, at most, sixty minutes from Eureka, yeah?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, give or take.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW Call me when you hear back from our friends over the border.” END
BEGIN NOW “Will do.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t get pulled over.” END
BEGIN NOW “I make no promises.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright man.  END
BEGIN NOW As you please.” END
BEGIN NOW “Right on.  END
BEGIN NOW Later.” Spencer hangs up.  END
BEGIN NOW He flicks the butt of the cigarette into the street and starts the engine.  END
BEGIN NOW “Give or take me getting a little shit faced.  END
BEGIN NOW  Ha ha!” The van roars down the street, trying to find the easiest way to get to a bar near the Motel Six Hundred in Eureka. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter nine; END
BEGIN NOW The downtown Berkeley Bart station expels you between Center and Allston on Shattuck.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a grand piece of street with large bank buildings and lots of brick.  END
BEGIN NOW When you take the escalator up to the sidewalk it will feel like riding the conveyor belt to urban everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW  There’s typically a person busking right before the escalator.  END
BEGIN NOW The music won’t be great but it will be a traveler in between places.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to make fare.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably going to San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone in the station is coming or going or waiting for a train.  END
BEGIN NOW They zig-zag and cross paths and wander about, looking for exits and not looking at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW You will be the clever one.  END
BEGIN NOW You will take the elevator, bypassing the turnstile, taking a free ride on the rapid transit express way to Berkeley California.  END
BEGIN NOW Home of the one block section of space designated for your kind of people.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of people that don’t have homes to sleep in. END
BEGIN NOW People’s Park isn’t much to look at.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a field and some trees.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of logs to sit on.  END
BEGIN NOW The odd camp here and there.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a collection of bedding and very few personal artifacts.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a public restroom that will never be clean.  END
BEGIN NOW  A barbeque pit that’s seldom in use.  END
BEGIN NOW A small garden where nothing much grows.  END
BEGIN NOW People come, people go.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s their park, and they can do with it as they please.  END
BEGIN NOW In Northern California there are a few places referred to as Sanctuary Cities.  END
BEGIN NOW  These are places where the homeless and outcast, the lost and weary are free to sleep on the benches and bus stops.  END
BEGIN NOW Where they can find a night of rest without worrying about a camping ticket.  END
BEGIN NOW Charging someone money for not having a place to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about as American as it gets.  END
BEGIN NOW No home, no friends, nowhere to crash?  That’ll be three hundred dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW How typically American. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher stands at the corner of Center and Shattuck.  END
BEGIN NOW His possessions are few.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a coat and a hat.  END
BEGIN NOW Old gloves that keep his hands warm.  END
BEGIN NOW He has old boots that only let the water in when the water has nowhere else to go.  END
BEGIN NOW His clothes have been stained so many times in so many ways that they both have the same, dull everything at once coloring.  END
BEGIN NOW The holes have been patched.  END
BEGIN NOW The patches grew holes and were patched again.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher holds on to any good thing he can get and keeps it until it is beyond repair.  END
BEGIN NOW The path to People’s Park from the Bart Station wanders in a number of different ways depending on the disposition of the pedestrian.  END
BEGIN NOW Oxford Lane will take you into the campus for the University of California.  END
BEGIN NOW The path will be lined with trees and students procrastinating between classes.  END
BEGIN NOW Oxford Lane will take you along into the west entrance of the campus.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep on the path; you’ll get to Telegraph in no time.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be a plaza or two and then you’ll see Bancroft being a cross street.  END
BEGIN NOW At the corner there will be a hotdog cart.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be a sexy drawing of a girl dressed up in a hotdog costume.  END
BEGIN NOW This may never make sense to you.  END
BEGIN NOW How does a sexy hotdog girl make me want to eat hotdogs? Why would this circumvent circuits in my brain against rational hotdog purchasing? Why do hotdog have to be sexy? Can’t we be content with something simply being delicious instead enticing and alluring? Do we really need the sexy element outside of say, things that are actually sexual? Is that really necessary?  Condiments of catsup and money-shot mustard in each of her hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Her body deep between the bun and a line three deep at the hotdog cart. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher waits for the light and looks both ways.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not the type of person that needs a light to tell him what to do.  END
BEGIN NOW He can manage to navigate the streets of a city with his eyes and ears and doesn’t need the chirping of mechanical birds to tell him when it is safe to cross the street.  END
BEGIN NOW He still presses the button and prefers to cross when all the lights are in his favor.  END
BEGIN NOW But if the light is red and there’s no sign of danger, why not trust your instincts? You are smarter than a red light.  END
BEGIN NOW You can cross the street.  END
BEGIN NOW No one’s going to stop you.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it. END
BEGIN NOW Telegraph Avenue starts off a little gentrified, but don’t worry.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s gets better.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a chain drug store and of all things, another bank.  END
BEGIN NOW There are corporate stores with corporate offices far from Berkeley, California.  END
BEGIN NOW But give it a block.  END
BEGIN NOW The inherent nature of the town will take shape soon enough.  END
BEGIN NOW The grunge will come through.  END
BEGIN NOW The grittier, more honest side of things will come around.  END
BEGIN NOW The mom and pop hole in the wall shops.  END
BEGIN NOW  Head shops and a palm reader.  END
BEGIN NOW Various eateries, but nothing terribly distinctive.  END
BEGIN NOW Decent fast food, most of the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Which is perfect for this time and place.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t really want to linger too long in one spot.  END
BEGIN NOW The place dictates that movement is a positive experience.  END
BEGIN NOW You feel like you should keep going.  END
BEGIN NOW Past the music stores, selling sounds on just about any format.  END
BEGIN NOW A floor full of records.  END
BEGIN NOW One full of CDs.  END
BEGIN NOW They probably sell cassettes in here someplace.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea of entering a music shop is a special kind of depressing.  END
BEGIN NOW You can look and gather up a collection of albums.  END
BEGIN NOW You will find just about everything you’ve ever wanted and never knew you needed.  END
BEGIN NOW At the end you’ll have to retrace your steps and put back the ones you can’t afford.  END
BEGIN NOW Trimming your stack down to a reasonable, affordable size. END
BEGIN NOW Take a left soon.  END
BEGIN NOW This will take you to the park.  END
BEGIN NOW The last resting place of the tired traveler types.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re free to set up shop here for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is going to mind your presence.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be welcome.  END
BEGIN NOW The scavengers will find you first.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about them.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll be distracted easily enough.  END
BEGIN NOW  Someone else will start smoking something or drinking from somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW And the scavengers will know about it.  END
BEGIN NOW  Somehow.  END
BEGIN NOW They will always know.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher takes a minute to rest and relax.  END
BEGIN NOW He rests his head on a log and lays his feet out in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW He decides it’s the perfect time of day for a nap.  END
BEGIN NOW The citizens of the park do as they may.  END
BEGIN NOW He will have some sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreams and rests and closes his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He rests for a few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW A boy with army issue camo pants and very bad hair cut approaches. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey man.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey.  END
BEGIN NOW Man.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey man.” The staccato of the boy’s voice wakes Beecher up form half sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW The half bum in transition.  END
BEGIN NOW “What is it my son?” Beecher coughs at the boy, barely making an attempt to cover his mouth with his hand.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey man.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey.” The boy continues. END
BEGIN NOW “We did that part already.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m on the next verse.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s move on.” Beecher is tired and doesn’t really feel like listening to repetition from the mouth of a youth. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m from L.A.”  He says this with a note of finality.  END
BEGIN NOW As if he’s made his point. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m very happy for you.  END
BEGIN NOW That must be a fascinating place to be from.  END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of activity and nonsense and tons of people doing wacky things for attention.  END
BEGIN NOW Yes, L.A.  END
BEGIN NOW is a fascinating place to be from.” Beecher the half bum.  END
BEGIN NOW Always seems to attract the nutty ones. END
BEGIN NOW “No.  END
BEGIN NOW Man.  END
BEGIN NOW What I mean is.  END
BEGIN NOW What I’m trying to say.  END
BEGIN NOW What.  END
BEGIN NOW Well.” The boy stammers, shaking his leg and looking around nervously.  END
BEGIN NOW “What I mean is.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW You got a smoke, man?” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher looks at him in frustration. END
BEGIN NOW “Let a man sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Piss off.” He closes his eyes again and drifts to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW The kid continues standing there.  END
BEGIN NOW Unsure of what to do next.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn’t counted on failing to get a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at Beecher.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks lost and confused. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey.  END
BEGIN NOW Man.” The youth looks at his feet and shuffles around, nervous like. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher cracks one eye, part way between apathy and annoyance. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes? What is it now?” Just a little peace and quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all he wants. END
BEGIN NOW “Where are we?” END
BEGIN NOW “You are here now.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all you need to know.  END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe you want to be there, then.  END
BEGIN NOW In which case, you should get a move on.  END
BEGIN NOW Right here right now isn’t a place you should be.  END
BEGIN NOW If I were you.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d go and bum a smoke off one of the kids that hangs out in front of the bars or coffee shops.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a place down the way that invented the latte.  END
BEGIN NOW A latte is like coffee but the milk is already mixed in.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a drink for pussies.  END
BEGIN NOW Pussies that don’t really like coffee, but sometimes they like to pretend that they do.  END
BEGIN NOW  But they have to go outside to smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not so much allowed inside places.  END
BEGIN NOW I have to smoke outside.  END
BEGIN NOW So, since I’m always outside, I’m always out of smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck off.” The half bum closes his eyes again, feeling pretty good about resolving that issue. END
BEGIN NOW “Look.  END
BEGIN NOW Dude.  END
BEGIN NOW Man.” END
BEGIN NOW “What is it?! For fuck’s sake man.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m trying to fucking sleep!” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, woah.  END
BEGIN NOW Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW Look.  END
BEGIN NOW Look.  END
BEGIN NOW Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW What I’m trying to say.  END
BEGIN NOW What I’m getting at.  END
BEGIN NOW Is like.  END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what there is to do in this town.  END
BEGIN NOW What should I do?” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher props himself up on one arm and stares at the boy.  END
BEGIN NOW His crusty hair.  END
BEGIN NOW His mangled beard.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the dirt under his chewed fingernails.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s perpetually stained hands.  END
BEGIN NOW His worn out clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I know what your problem is.  END
BEGIN NOW You need a guru.  END
BEGIN NOW You need a leader.  END
BEGIN NOW Obviously, you have no mind to think for yourself and make your own decisions.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t make up your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t know where you are.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t even know how to kill a few hours until something distracts you.  END
BEGIN NOW This is your problem.  END
BEGIN NOW This is what they call boredom.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a disease.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t proven that yet, but I’ve got most of the paper work done and it’s only a matter of time before they take me seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW I know all about the plague of boredom sweeping the nation.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been coming in waves ever since they started printing comic books and real life could never match up to that kind of intensity.  END
BEGIN NOW Ever since someone made comic books and those Fantastic Stories magazines.  END
BEGIN NOW Some kid somewhere in the middle of fucking farmland, U.S.A.  END
BEGIN NOW is looking outside his window.  END
BEGIN NOW All he sees are cornfields and bean fields and a bunch of those goddamn bean eaters harvesting the lot.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks out his window and doesn’t see a superman or a super anything.  END
BEGIN NOW He sees grains and fields and cow shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Real life will never have the pace or flow of a comic book.  END
BEGIN NOW That kid will grow up and work the farm and go to school and get a job and keep looking out his window.  END
BEGIN NOW And he will never see anything nearly as marvelous as what he saw in those fucking comic books.  END
BEGIN NOW  That’s not unlike your problem.  END
BEGIN NOW You grew up with everything in the world at your disposal.  END
BEGIN NOW Now look at you.  END
BEGIN NOW Encrusted with the grime of being perpetually lost in a sea of every possibility.  END
BEGIN NOW  You have nowhere to go because you could be anywhere right now.  END
BEGIN NOW So you’re nowhere in particular, bumming smokes off a man that’s just trying to take a nap.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what are you going to do?” END
BEGIN NOW The youth shakes his head.  END
BEGIN NOW He still doesn’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been fascinating listening to the half bum speak for so long, but he’s still nowhere at all. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher sighs.  END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.  END
BEGIN NOW So you still don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW I figured as much.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as you don’t worry about it, something will come along and distract you.  END
BEGIN NOW Just be open to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Your distractions will lead you in the right direction.  END
BEGIN NOW At first it will seem like they are unreasonable impulses.  END
BEGIN NOW This is false.  END
BEGIN NOW They are signals to your brain telling you where to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Just pay attention and you’ll end up where you need to be.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not so complicated.  END
BEGIN NOW Life is a pretty simple game.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe me.  END
BEGIN NOW I only speak truth.” END
BEGIN NOW The youth seems disappointed.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems just as lost as when this whole discussion began. END
BEGIN NOW “So… what you’re saying is… You don’t have a cigarette to bum me?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh fuck off and get arrested.  END
BEGIN NOW You sicken me.” Beecher lies down and closes his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He has no need for the youth of this land disturbing him.  END
BEGIN NOW He has nothing to offer except wisdom and advice. END
BEGIN NOW The kid stumbles off in another direction, hands in his pockets, not so deep in thought.  END
BEGIN NOW Just waiting for something to come along and give him a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher begins to dream.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreams of cheering crowds and banners with his name on it.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreams of the mob in his favor.  END
BEGIN NOW They are chanting and holding him aloft.  END
BEGIN NOW They want him to lead them.  END
BEGIN NOW They want to look to him for guidance.  END
BEGIN NOW They hang on his every word and praise his every gesture, however meaningless.  END
BEGIN NOW There are lights and flash bulbs and fanatics.  END
BEGIN NOW They want to make him their leader.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just being swept away in the tide of madness.  END
BEGIN NOW Happy to be caught up in a crowd that doesn’t want to see him rot away behind bars. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Ten. END
BEGIN NOW The sprawl is no place to have a parish.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what he heard all the time, trying to start up a community of true believers.  END
BEGIN NOW The sprawl is unforgiving and relentless.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s perfect, thought Reverend Carmichael.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why I should be there.  END
BEGIN NOW Because someone needs to fill that gap.  END
BEGIN NOW I can be forgiving.  END
BEGIN NOW I will give hope and peace back to the suburban wasteland.  END
BEGIN NOW They need me out there.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s exactly where I should be.  END
BEGIN NOW In the den of his home, Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael takes a long pull from the pint of rum in his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW They need me, he thought.  END
BEGIN NOW They need me and I need them.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to work out someday.  END
BEGIN NOW Just trust the lord.  END
BEGIN NOW He will provide.  END
BEGIN NOW The lord giveth and taketh away.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it go already.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a drunk driver.  END
BEGIN NOW There was an ambulance.  END
BEGIN NOW There were sirens and gurneys and people in uniforms asking questions.  END
BEGIN NOW There were familiar bodies in unfamiliar positions, no longer moving.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten years is a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten years is a long time to grieve.  END
BEGIN NOW Give it time.  END
BEGIN NOW Time will heal all wounds, however deep.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what they told him.  END
BEGIN NOW They told him they were in Heaven now.  END
BEGIN NOW They were with god and he was still here.  END
BEGIN NOW And now he was all alone.  END
BEGIN NOW That goddamn drunkard and that blind corner. END
BEGIN NOW Pictures of his family line the mantle.  END
BEGIN NOW Above a fireplace he refuses to use.  END
BEGIN NOW Pictures of dead faces long buried.  END
BEGIN NOW It was tragic.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what the newspapers called it.  END
BEGIN NOW  A tragedy.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no word for what that was.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no word in the English language that encompasses the feeling of having your entire family killed in one blinding moment.  END
BEGIN NOW In one big crash and sudden slamming stop with shattering glass and then silence that could fill a canyon.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no word for the feeling that comes ten years afterward.  END
BEGIN NOW The best we have is grief.  END
BEGIN NOW Is loss.  END
BEGIN NOW Is coping.  END
BEGIN NOW Is sitting frozen forever in the faces above the mantle.  END
BEGIN NOW Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael drinks and looks at the pictures.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the pictures and drinks and looks at nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW He feels the dizziness in his head and the emptiness in his chest and looks at nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW He stares for a good hour in the den of his empty home where he lives and sleeps.  END
BEGIN NOW His church is across the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a single story structure with one front door and one back door.  END
BEGIN NOW A small cemetery off to the side for the good people that passed away.  END
BEGIN NOW Passed away.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what they call it.  END
BEGIN NOW Passing.  END
BEGIN NOW How trite and pacifying.  END
BEGIN NOW  Like just passing through.  END
BEGIN NOW Just passing by.  END
BEGIN NOW Just passing away.  END
BEGIN NOW The reverend takes another pull, right off the bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow is Sunday.  END
BEGIN NOW Correction.  END
BEGIN NOW Today is Sunday, as of two hours ago.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a sermon to write.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s thinking tomorrow is a good day to preach about Pilate.  END
BEGIN NOW Pilate the politician.  END
BEGIN NOW Pilate that didn’t really do much.  END
BEGIN NOW Pilate that had the life of Christ at his disposal and did nothing to aid him.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a huge oversimplification of the ordeal.  END
BEGIN NOW Really, Pilate wanted to get rid of Jesus, but not kill him.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw Jesus as not his problem.  END
BEGIN NOW He did everything in his power not to deal with the Jesus phenomenon.  END
BEGIN NOW  He constantly found no fault in him.  END
BEGIN NOW He was about to release him to the mob.  END
BEGIN NOW But the mob called for a murderer instead.  END
BEGIN NOW  Another revolutionary that was violent and prone to acts of inspiring.  END
BEGIN NOW  The mob loves violence.  END
BEGIN NOW The mob loves someone that’s not afraid to kill one or two people to make a point.  END
BEGIN NOW And that is one of the reasons the mob is stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be a part of the mob.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t just shout along with the others because you’re part of a group.  END
BEGIN NOW They will mislead you.  END
BEGIN NOW This sounds like a silly message to convey to a church community.  END
BEGIN NOW Where they will all nod their heads in unison. END
BEGIN NOW As a boy, Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael would think, what would Dashiell Hammett do? What would Raymond Chandler do? What would Sam Spade do? Well, they’d probably get drunk and forget about it.  END
BEGIN NOW But the mysteries were already solved.  END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing left to uncover.  END
BEGIN NOW There were no bad guys in the shadows.  END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing left except half a pint of rum and an unwritten sermon and the people that lived in between cities.  END
BEGIN NOW No quite the big city or the smaller city off to the side.  END
BEGIN NOW The continual in between.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither here nor there.  END
BEGIN NOW The sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the excess of one city or another spewing out onto the concrete streets.  END
BEGIN NOW The pattern of post office, mechanic, barber shop, corner store, liquor store, mechanic, barber shop, liquor store, beauty salon, corner store that sells liquor, restaurant where no one speaks English as a first language.  END
BEGIN NOW The sprawl is just a never ending pattern extending in all directions until you come across the wilderness.  END
BEGIN NOW Until the trees or the hills or the dust comes back to try and reclaim the land. END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend sits in a large easy chair.  END
BEGIN NOW The soft cushions doing little to comfort him.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the yellow legal pad in front of him and scrawls various ideas for a sermon.  END
BEGIN NOW Preacher man with a head full of pity.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t feel like teaching fire and brimstone lessons any more.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not one to be condemning the people tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW He just wants everyone to care for each other.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s thinking tomorrow is a good day for some Good Samaritan sermonizing.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes a list of verses to quote.  END
BEGIN NOW  He makes a few notes for anecdotes from his life and the lives of others that demonstrate the power of one person to lend a hand.  END
BEGIN NOW That no one is above helping someone out when they have the power to.  END
BEGIN NOW That everyone has the power to get the poor bastard off the street for a minute. END
BEGIN NOW Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael throws the empty bottle into the fireplace.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears the glass break and slumps in his chair, letting the legal pad fall on the floor near his slippers.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the mantle and his wife’s face looking down on him.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at her and sees the blood on her forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW The way her face looked with bits of windshield stuck in her skin.  END
BEGIN NOW How the red stains turned brown on her clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW How his son looked with his neck broken and his daughter looked smashed between the front and back seats.  END
BEGIN NOW And how he had survived the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW With only a neck brace and a broken leg.  END
BEGIN NOW The limp remained.  END
BEGIN NOW Every time he walked a ripple of pain would shoot up his back and he would remember everything.  END
BEGIN NOW He would never heal completely.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew this and looked at the broken bottle in the fireplace.  END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend wept. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter eleven.  END
BEGIN NOW Every decent town has at least one dive bar.  END
BEGIN NOW The dive bar will be near or in the low income housing district.  END
BEGIN NOW The paint will be five or so years past fresh.  END
BEGIN NOW The décor will vary greatly depending on the specific geography and intent of the owner.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be a few things you can count on in a dive bar.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be cheap beer there.  END
BEGIN NOW And there will be whiskey in one form or another.  END
BEGIN NOW The good dive bars allow smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW The not so good ones let you smoke in certain places at certain times.  END
BEGIN NOW The bad ones don’t allow smoking at all.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how to tell if it’s really a dive bar or just poor old watering hole.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartenders should be a bit surly.  END
BEGIN NOW They shouldn’t trust anyone that hasn’t been coming here for at least a year.  END
BEGIN NOW They won’t trust anyone that doesn’t believe in drinking in a bar before sunset.  END
BEGIN NOW Dive bars are the perfect place to get drunk when it’s still light outside.  END
BEGIN NOW Inside the bar, the lighting will never change.  END
BEGIN NOW It will always be dim.  END
BEGIN NOW It should always be a little smoky.  END
BEGIN NOW And the music could be anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW A decent dive bar will play a lot of blues, classic rock, old country music, or obscure punk.  END
BEGIN NOW A really nice dive bar will play all of the above with no regard to playlists or following a theme.  END
BEGIN NOW The not so decent dive bars will play a lot of Indy rock.  END
BEGIN NOW They play it with an air of superiority.  END
BEGIN NOW Like if you don’t know the band and all of the members first names, their musical history, all the other bands they’re currently playing in and have played for.  END
BEGIN NOW The tragic shortcomings of failed attempts at a solo career.  END
BEGIN NOW If your knowledge of music doesn’t verge on obsessive you will be an outcast.  END
BEGIN NOW The most awesome and inspiring of dive bars play heavy metal.  END
BEGIN NOW They play it loud and don’t give a fuck about you.  END
BEGIN NOW The metal bar will always allow smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW Self destruction is one of the most metal things a person can do.  END
BEGIN NOW Regardless of the tolerance for smoking, there will always be a huddle of smokers outside the metal bar.  END
BEGIN NOW This is to warn passersby about what lies in store should they walk in the doors.  END
BEGIN NOW The average barfly will be intimidated.  END
BEGIN NOW They will stumble past to a friendly looking crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW But they don’t know these people.  END
BEGIN NOW All they’d have to say is something like, “Danzig rocks.” Or “My life was empty until is started listening to Pantara.” Or, “This one time I was drinking tall cans in a parking lot listening to Slayer…” And they will open up to you.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re people too.  END
BEGIN NOW They just have more tattoos and piercings.  END
BEGIN NOW They own more black leather than you.  END
BEGIN NOW However, just because they may shake your hand doesn’t mean they like you.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t mistake their tolerance for acceptance.  END
BEGIN NOW That will be the end of your career at the metal bar.  END
BEGIN NOW One slip and they will not hesitate to punch you in the face.  END
BEGIN NOW They are people too.  END
BEGIN NOW People with an edge.  END
BEGIN NOW Every once in a while, there will be a dive bar that has a soundtrack heavy with rhythm and blues.  END
BEGIN NOW With soul and Motown.  END
BEGIN NOW This will be a very relaxed bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone here will be taking it easy, trying to look cool.  END
BEGIN NOW Al Green and Otis Redding will play in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound will not over take your conversations.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be pleasant and allow you to carry on with your business undisturbed.  END
BEGIN NOW The people in the bar won’t notice you much.  END
BEGIN NOW They will be too busy looking at their own reflections or listening to the sound of their own voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Or looking cool rolling their own cigarettes and drinking absinthe.  END
BEGIN NOW  Every once in a while sending text messages to their friends who are doing the same thing at other bars all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW At the end of the bar balancing quarters, three whiskies deep and sinking rapidly, is Spencer Raleigh.  END
BEGIN NOW  He’s going down a list of whiskey drinks he keeps in his head.  END
BEGIN NOW He starts off with top shelf.  END
BEGIN NOW Make it a perfect Manhattan.  END
BEGIN NOW A perfect Manhattan is equal parts sweet and dry vermouth.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a maraschino cherry and lots of bourbon.  END
BEGIN NOW It should be shaken until ice cold.  END
BEGIN NOW Little flecks of ice cubes will float the surface of the martini glass that holds it.  END
BEGIN NOW He tried as always to tie the cherry stem with his teeth and tongue.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again he was defeated.  END
BEGIN NOW For the next round he takes a whiskey sour with middle shelf bourbon.  END
BEGIN NOW He squeezed the lemon wedge into his glass and dropped it in with the ice stirring with the straw and taking one long, slow sip.  END
BEGIN NOW He discards the straw for the remainder of the drink, cutting out the middle man.  END
BEGIN NOW The third time around is a tossup.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s either a sidecar, if he’s in the right mood, or a bourbon and ginger with a splash of bitters and a twist of lime.  END
BEGIN NOW He went with the bourbon and ginger.  END
BEGIN NOW His disposition wasn’t the sweetest of things these days.  END
BEGIN NOW His shoulders still sore from digging up two bodies.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands still sore from hauling all the human baggage around.  END
BEGIN NOW His mind still aching from slight paranoia and giddy from clandestine operations.  END
BEGIN NOW For science.  END
BEGIN NOW He drank to science for the third time that night. END
BEGIN NOW In front of him sits two dollars in quarters all on ends spaced equidistant.  END
BEGIN NOW He folds his dollar bills into pyramids, making tip towers to command the attention of the bartender.  END
BEGIN NOW A little trick he picked up from strip clubs.  END
BEGIN NOW The tallest tower wins the lap dance game.  END
BEGIN NOW The tallest tip might win you a free drink if you behave.  END
BEGIN NOW He was determined to establish enough credit in the span of two hours to earn a free shot of Fernet.  END
BEGIN NOW Fernet is by most standards a foul liquor.  END
BEGIN NOW The taste is very herbal and pungent.  END
BEGIN NOW It hits you in the throat and goes down like over steeped tea and burning.  END
BEGIN NOW But after you’ve made your shot taking face.  END
BEGIN NOW After you’ve coughed and felt the burn subside, you’re left with a pleasant afterglow that will carry on for a few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer lives for the burn.  END
BEGIN NOW He lives for the rush of the pain and the flow of endorphins.  END
BEGIN NOW The brain over compensating for nonexistent pain.  END
BEGIN NOW The pain in his bladder has caught up to him.  END
BEGIN NOW The time has come to break the seal.  END
BEGIN NOW To let flow the buildup of urine stewing below his belly.  END
BEGIN NOW He ambles up to the restroom and opens the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He steadies himself by the urinal and begins to fidget with his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn button fly.  END
BEGIN NOW Common enemy of the drunken man.  END
BEGIN NOW Eventually his fingers do the right thing and he’s overwhelmed with relief.  END
BEGIN NOW His body drains and he rests for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW The lights in the room seem to brighten slightly as he feels the piss flowing from his penis.  END
BEGIN NOW He begins to notice the smell in here.  END
BEGIN NOW He begins to notice that he’s not alone in the restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s someone sitting in the stall next to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He can hear the breathing patterns of struggle.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided it’s time to button up and go back to his glass. END
BEGIN NOW He washes his hands and takes two paper towels to dry them off.  END
BEGIN NOW  He exits the restroom and returns to his drink.  END
BEGIN NOW His tip tower is gone, but his drink is full again.  END
BEGIN NOW A sign of partial success.  END
BEGIN NOW He might get all the way to shitfaced drunk in no time.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s off to a good start.  END
BEGIN NOW He has twenty dollars left in his drinking budget.  END
BEGIN NOW That should be enough to get where he needs to be.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes a hard gulp of whiskey into his system.  END
BEGIN NOW He feels the warm whiskey glow flowing over his body.  END
BEGIN NOW He smiles a bourbon soaked smile and continues looking at all the bottles. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey bartender, hey excuse me.” He calls over a short girl with shorter black hair that’s perfectly styled.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a single hair out of place.  END
BEGIN NOW She has bright green eyes and the complexion of a doll.  END
BEGIN NOW “Whatcha need?” Her hands are in her pockets, but she’s ready for action.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be fooled.  END
BEGIN NOW “That bottle down there, the dusty that looks kinda French.” She motions towards the very bottom shelf with the hardly ever used for anything alcohol.  END
BEGIN NOW “No, not that one, two bottles to the left.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, the green one.  END
BEGIN NOW What does that do?” END
BEGIN NOW “I think it gets you drunk.” She says it with a smile, perpetually charmed by the simplicity of the barfly mentality. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I mean, like.  END
BEGIN NOW What does it taste like? What’s it used for? It looks so neglected down there.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m curious.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m curious about the contents of that little green bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell me more.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, why don’t we try it?” She has two glasses ready and pours a little more than a sip into each one.  END
BEGIN NOW They clink glasses and touch them to the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW He says, “For science!” END
BEGIN NOW She says, “Hail Satan!” END
BEGIN NOW And they drink the mystery liquor, trying out a little something off the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW “Wow.” Spence says blinking a lot from the burn and sensation of a new taste.  END
BEGIN NOW “Taste like oranges and ass.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ha! I was thinking bitter lemons, but yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Oranges and ass works pretty well.” END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell would you do with that? I mean, how would you mix the damn thing?” END
BEGIN NOW “That, that I’d mix with something like soda and more citrus, maybe a little something sweet to knock down that bitterness.  END
BEGIN NOW Want me to try something?” She looks at Spence in eager anticipation.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he’s not a vodka drinker.  END
BEGIN NOW  At least he’s not ordering goddamn mohito.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he doesn’t want me to muddle for him. END
BEGIN NOW “Wait until I finish this one.” He takes a long steady intake of whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, I think we’re ready for it.” END
BEGIN NOW She laughs lightly and begins getting the ingredients into a shaker.  END
BEGIN NOW She tastes with a long straw, plugging her finger over the top and dropping the liquid into her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She keeps shaking her head and going to another corner of the bar to fetch another bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW Eventually she seems content.  END
BEGIN NOW She pours the mixture into a rocks glass and slides it over to Spence on a napkin.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes a slow sip from the straw and thinks it over in his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW He tosses the drink from side to side between his cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW “Not bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Not bad at all.  END
BEGIN NOW This is very drinkable.” He throws the straws away and takes another gulp from the glass.  END
BEGIN NOW He smiles looking down at his drink.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, you got a name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Jamie to most folks.  END
BEGIN NOW Jamie Concord.” She extends a hand over the bar top. END
BEGIN NOW “Spencer Raleigh.  END
BEGIN NOW But Spence is just fine with me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a big fan of brevity.  END
BEGIN NOW A pleasure to meet you.” Spence extracts a cigarette and lights it.  END
BEGIN NOW As he exhales there’s a bit of dizziness thrown in.  END
BEGIN NOW Time to slow things down a little. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Jamie… would it be too much to ask for a bit of water?” END
BEGIN NOW “Not at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m more than happy to give someone a glass of water.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks.  END
BEGIN NOW You pretty good at this bartending business.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, shit, there ain’t much else to do in this town.  END
BEGIN NOW Drinking seems to pass the time just fine.” END
BEGIN NOW “Tell me about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Say, where’s a good place to eat?” END
BEGIN NOW She laughs a little.  END
BEGIN NOW “When you say good place to eat are we talking like, good food or open late or interesting?” END
BEGIN NOW “Any of the above would suit me just fine.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, then you’re shit outta luck sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “Damnit.  END
BEGIN NOW Well hows about something edible and close by?” END
BEGIN NOW “How do you feel about hotdogs?” END
BEGIN NOW “Most of the time, pretty good.” END
BEGIN NOW “There’s a hot dog place about two blocks away.  END
BEGIN NOW Just don’t get the chili dog.  END
BEGIN NOW It will sound mighty tasty.  END
BEGIN NOW But don’t believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just get a regular hotdog and load it up how you like.  END
BEGIN NOW But no chili.  END
BEGIN NOW The chili will ruin you.  END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow morning you will be hating life.  END
BEGIN NOW Just take my word for it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds reasonable.  END
BEGIN NOW How late are they open?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I think until midnight.  END
BEGIN NOW Ish.  END
BEGIN NOW Should be fine.” END
BEGIN NOW “What time is it now? I’m kinda drunk.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well you should be! After all I’ve done for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s see, it’s about…” Jamie finds a clock on a distant wall.  END
BEGIN NOW “About, six thirty, give or take.” END
BEGIN NOW “Give or take what?” END
BEGIN NOW “The last time someone bothered to check if the clock was accurate.” END
BEGIN NOW “Hmm.  END
BEGIN NOW This does not bode well.  END
BEGIN NOW I may have to leave.” END
BEGIN NOW “Aw, so soon? You just got here.  END
BEGIN NOW And you’re the best customer I’ve had all night.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sorry lady, business meeting.” END
BEGIN NOW “Business meeting at this hour? While you’re half way to shitfaced?” END
BEGIN NOW “Ha! I’m a little over halfway.  END
BEGIN NOW As soon as I start walking, I expect to be most of the way there.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll try and stop back again after work is done.  END
BEGIN NOW But I make no promises.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fair enough.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been nice.” END
BEGIN NOW “Indeed it has.  END
BEGIN NOW Jamie, thanks again.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and what do I owe you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t sweat it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just come back soon and we can work something out.” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re an angel of mercy.” END
BEGIN NOW “Aw shucks.” She says shucks in a way that implies many late night Leave It to Beaver marathons.  END
BEGIN NOW She says it with a look that could pacify a lone gunman.  END
BEGIN NOW That would make a bridge jumper reconsider.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a look on her face that could bring about world peace and feed the hungry children of Africa. END
BEGIN NOW Spence closes the door behind him and pulls his coat a little tighter.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn NorCal weather.  END
BEGIN NOW He lights another cigarette and walks across the street to the Motel Six Hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks to the lot where his van is parked. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter twelve: END
BEGIN NOW On a couch at the end of the street, in an apartment in between states of disaster and functional mess, Laurel wakes up to the sound of cement saws and hammering.  END
BEGIN NOW She hears voices in Spanish, the screaming of small children and their mothers trying to contain them.  END
BEGIN NOW She cracks her eyes open and smells stale cigarette smoke and tastes stale beer fermenting inside her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the walls and sees deranged doodles and photographs of mohawked madmen dancing at dawn down by the seashore.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs in a distinctly non-French accent.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs the hangover sigh that’s not from staying up all night guzzling cheap wine on the patio of some café with overpriced bread and bohemians laying about as they tend to do.  END
BEGIN NOW She sighs and groans and feels her head pound in an empty fashion.  END
BEGIN NOW The mark of another till dawn two case of beer escapade that landed them on a lookout well above the bay, with the sea of lights and the stark darkness of the ocean at night in between.  END
BEGIN NOW The shambles somehow slept right through the saws and the kids and Spanish.  END
BEGIN NOW He snored away, shirtless and short clad, wrapped in a tangle of blanket that did little to conceal his frame.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel sat up slightly and was instantly overcome by the sour longing in her stomach.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, when had she eaten last? She looks at the kitchen and sees a trail of sauce leading to a line of dishes, going into the sink.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh right.  END
BEGIN NOW We ate before passing out.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t understand how they manage to do this.  END
BEGIN NOW Night after night.  END
BEGIN NOW  Case of beer, bong loads and countless cigarettes until consciousness seems like too much effort and just then someone is cooking breakfast.  END
BEGIN NOW Or is it dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun was almost up but time is only measured as the space in between naps.  END
BEGIN NOW What a strange situation I seem to have landed in.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t even know what day it is anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I doubt these guys even care.  END
BEGIN NOW If I asked, they’d just laugh at me again.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, Marji.  END
BEGIN NOW Where have you sent me? This is like some kind of parody of a Buddhist monastery.  END
BEGIN NOW Every time I have a question, I’m either laughed at or given some kind of meaningless rambling response that only leaves me kinda confused.  END
BEGIN NOW And where the fuck is my phone call? Where the fuck is my boyfriend? I’ve been here for at least a few days and nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a peep.  END
BEGIN NOW  Not a nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW  I bet he called the house phone.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamnit. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel has her ache in her hands and keeps closing and unclosing her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Opening isn’t really the right word for it.  END
BEGIN NOW They never quite make it to open.  END
BEGIN NOW She decides now is a good time to smoke a joint.  END
BEGIN NOW A good morning marijuana cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW That always seems to wake the boys up.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe, she’s thinking, maybe she should make breakfast and try and repay a little hospitality.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe wash some dishes to get today started on the right foot.  END
BEGIN NOW She decides against waking the boys up with the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s going to be a little selfish and smoke it outside.  END
BEGIN NOW She opens the door and moves silently into the noonday sun.  END
BEGIN NOW She quickly doubles back for her sunglasses and feels instantly relieved from the sheer brightness of it all.  END
BEGIN NOW The freshness of the air is only in contrast to the mustiness of the room.  END
BEGIN NOW The light of the sun only because she stumbled out of the darkness of inside.  END
BEGIN NOW In a little while she will have adjusted to everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The joint works wonders on her body and mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Feeling so much better with every inhalation. END
BEGIN NOW She perches on a set of concrete steps right about the laundry room.  END
BEGIN NOW She watches the construction workers build two identical staircases at the opening of the apartment complex.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a spot where the sun isn’t too hard on her just now waking up and coming to terms with today head.  END
BEGIN NOW The headache is just a minor vexation now.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s stoned enough for it not to be a problem anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as she relaxes, a low murmur of a voice interrupts her comfort.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice is something of a permanent slur eminating from a forever clenched jaw.  END
BEGIN NOW The tone is that of an old reel to reel cartoon when the tape catches something and the voices slow down, still fluctuating in wildly animated ways but at half the speed of regular conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW “Heeey.” END
BEGIN NOW Laurel turns to see something of a skeleton standing behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW The bone structure is stark and clearly visible beneath the skin.  END
BEGIN NOW The eyes sunk in their sockets and the cheeks have retreated towards the back of his head.  END
BEGIN NOW His faces makes something of a smile but it comes across like the someone whispering about what smiles used to look like when they were a child, like someone whispering in the next room about a smile they saw once that used to run around the block and dance all night with the prettiest girl in school, but once the smile grew up it was drafted and fought in a war where it lost its legs and came home crippled and living off charity. END
BEGIN NOW The face looks prematurely aged as if it were found by a middle aged housewife at a yard sale, stuck inside a used food dehydrator bought from a late night infomercial when all other options seemed hopeless.  END
BEGIN NOW The eyes are hollow and flat, not even a hint that something is happening behind them.  END
BEGIN NOW They are the kind of green that is found only on winter coats at thrift stores made back in the days before color television when fashion designers came to work reeking of bathtub gin and feeling vindictive.  END
BEGIN NOW They are dull and all the softness is gone from them.  END
BEGIN NOW There are burn marks on his fat lips and he has the kind of teeth you see in dental school text books when they are giving the lessons on why dental care is so important and what will happen to your teeth if you spend half your life smoking drugs in massive quantities.  END
BEGIN NOW A few of his teeth have jumped from the beef jerky ship of his face only to drown in the pools of gut rot discount liquor found in sporadic spots all over the floor of what used to be called an apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Is probably now called a hazardous material zone.  END
BEGIN NOW Will probably be called in the future, police line do not cross. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks up at him like he’s a bad dream taking refuge in the body of a nightmare possessed a legion of devils covered in fading tattoos and bearing the scars of bare fisted street fights.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s much too early in the afternoon for this.  END
BEGIN NOW This is not someone you want to wake up to.  END
BEGIN NOW She just continues staring at him and growing slightly defensive. END
BEGIN NOW “Heeey.  END
BEGIN NOW That a joint yer smokin’?” He mumbles the words out of his mouth like the caricature of a man with one hand jumping across a river on the rocks with a pogo stick with a broken spring.  END
BEGIN NOW The dead spring clashes around inside uselessly and the rocks are slippery with algae. END
BEGIN NOW “No, no it’s not.” She can’t even utilize the smart ass response mechanism in her brain.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s stunned into flat out lying. END
BEGIN NOW “Sure smells like ah joint.  END
BEGIN NOW A heeuhhee a heeuhhee.” The laugh escapes desperately in a low rumbling fumble of feeble amiability finishing with the kind of wheezing mostly heard in hospital wings where the nurses wheel the old people off to die. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, sorry to disappoint you.” Laurel shifts uncomfortably but not at all sorry, taking in his much too shiny shoes and his ball cap emblazoned with the words ‘I’m the Boss’.  END
BEGIN NOW  His sleeveless black shirt and black jeans.  END
BEGIN NOW He scratches his neck and twists his face into something in between a snarl and his handicapped smile. END
BEGIN NOW “Weeell.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh kay.  END
BEGIN NOW Byee.” With that he staggers with hands in pockets to a door across the way and knocks.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks in and closes the door behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel snubs out the rest of the joint and walks back inside the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW The shambles is propped up in bed, smoking a cigarette and blinking; jarred by the opening of the door and the burst of sunlight from outside. END
BEGIN NOW “Where’ve you been? It’s too early for anything.” He taps the ash into a tray and takes another drag. END
BEGIN NOW “I was sitting on the steps outside and saw the most tragic thing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, you met The Moth.” The shambles giggles to himself. END
BEGIN NOW “The Moth? Is that what you call something like that? How’d he get that name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, he used to live in this apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d come over any time we had the kitchen light on.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s the living embodiment of tragedy.  END
BEGIN NOW You should hear his stories.  END
BEGIN NOW That’ll make you thankful for everything that’s ever happened to you.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s a walking testament to just how tragic life could have been for any of us.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fucking hell.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to listen to his stories.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to hear that voice ever again.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s his problem anyway?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, he’s just a crackhead with an apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Living off his families charity and playing the drums, somehow.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s enough.  END
BEGIN NOW That solves the mystery.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want to know anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW That works for me.” END
BEGIN NOW “Suit yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s a character.  END
BEGIN NOW  You’ll run into him again the longer you stay here.” END
BEGIN NOW “I really don’t want to do that.  END
BEGIN NOW He scares me.” END
BEGIN NOW “He’s harmless.  END
BEGIN NOW I think.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he’s never done anything that seemed harmful.  END
BEGIN NOW At least not to anyone except himself.” The shambles puts the butt in the ashtray, pushing it down until it has been snuffed. END
BEGIN NOW “After that, after that I think I  eed a shower.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s typical.  END
BEGIN NOW Suit yourself, she’s all yours.” END
BEGIN NOW In the bathroom, all alone with the ashtray and the mirror, Laurel undresses.  END
BEGIN NOW She turns on the water and waits until everything is just right, when the water is a comforting warmth.  END
BEGIN NOW She slips in the stream and feels a wave of water wash over her thirsty skin.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets her hair get wet to the scalp, rinses off the sweat and grim and dead skin from her body and stand in the water for a while, looking out the window. END
BEGIN NOW She turns the faucet off and takes a towel off the rack and dries herself thoroughly.  END
BEGIN NOW  In the mirror she combs her hair out from the tangles from her shoulder length brunette hair.  END
BEGIN NOW  When she was a younger woman she went through a phase so common these days of changing her hair color and trying various ways of changing her look.  END
BEGIN NOW Of resetting all the details to seem like a different person every so often.  END
BEGIN NOW Now she’s let it grow out to the hair she was born with.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice natural brown like freshly polished oak furniture.  END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror she takes a good look at her face.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hazel eyes are still there, a little bloodshot from the joint, but still somewhere in between brown and green.  END
BEGIN NOW Some days they were a little greener or a bit more brown.  END
BEGIN NOW  Today they seems balanced, right in the middle.  END
BEGIN NOW Greener in the middle and extending outward to brown edges.  END
BEGIN NOW She always thought her nose was a little too small for her face.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe said it was a cute nose that seemed to shy away from the rest of her face.  END
BEGIN NOW Her lips were not over bearing, they didn’t jut out and were not too thin.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face was not exactly perfect symmetry.  END
BEGIN NOW But it was close enough for no one notice.  END
BEGIN NOW And for the most part, she didn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel puts on her clothes and brushes her hair, brushes her teeth and does her best to look presentable.  END
BEGIN NOW She makes some effort to look like she hasn’t been holed up in hiding for the last few days.  END
BEGIN NOW  She plans on hitting the town.  END
BEGIN NOW She plans on going out and looking around.  END
BEGIN NOW She has so many plans.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to be a shame.  END
BEGIN NOW But she doesn’t know that yet.  END
BEGIN NOW She has yet to discover that plans always fail.  END
BEGIN NOW She would be better off setting goals.  END
BEGIN NOW Goals can always be reached regardless of how they come about.  END
BEGIN NOW But plans are too specific.  END
BEGIN NOW Plans always get broken.  END
BEGIN NOW Plans don’t plan for all the roadblocks life throws in the way.  END
BEGIN NOW Plans are not too accommodating for shit hitting the fan.  END
BEGIN NOW The best laid plans.  END
BEGIN NOW Something along those lines. END
BEGIN NOW Fully clothed and groomed and smelling less like she lives on a couch, less like she’s been trapped in a room full of cigarette smoke and tweedle dee and tweedle dumbass and their madcap philosophical existential nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW She does her best to rise above her circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW She tries so hard to be something more than what she is.  END
BEGIN NOW To give the appearance of being greater than the sum of her parts. END
BEGIN NOW Back in the living room and the Shambles has a shirt on.  END
BEGIN NOW He noodles on what should be a broken guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW The guitar has made it a long way.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now it’s held together by little more than five layers of paint and all the love in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW It has been repaired so many times now that the instrument is a patch work of resourcefulness.  END
BEGIN NOW The bridge came from a piece of material, origin unknown, that had six slots carved in for the strings.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a built in pick on the side held to the guitar by an excess string.  END
BEGIN NOW The Shambles plucks away and cares for little else right now. END
BEGIN NOW “You hungry?” Laurel asks, stepping into the kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW “Perpetually.” The Shambles says and keeps on fingering out a melody of little to no consequence. END
BEGIN NOW “Excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW Good.” Laurel rolls up her sleeves and looks at the kitchen like battle ground.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a boyfriend, she used to do this.  END
BEGIN NOW But right now she feels like a caretaker.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s wondering how did these guys survive without her.  END
BEGIN NOW How much they’ll miss her when she’s gone.  END
BEGIN NOW She scrubs away at crusty pots and pans.  END
BEGIN NOW She washes the only four plates in the house.  END
BEGIN NOW The only three forks and two spoons.  END
BEGIN NOW These crazy guys living with the bare necessities.  END
BEGIN NOW Just enough to get by and damn if we ever have real company.  END
BEGIN NOW They can bring their own spoon to the party.  END
BEGIN NOW They should know better.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel washes the dishes and wonders about these things.  END
BEGIN NOW She wonders about her phone call and Roscoe sitting in some terrible police interrogation room.  END
BEGIN NOW She wonders if police interrogation is anything like the movies or cop dramas on the television.  END
BEGIN NOW She hopes it’s not so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW The poor bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, what a buzz kill.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel dries the plates and silverware.  END
BEGIN NOW She dries off the pots and pans and open the fridge to find something worth cooking. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the fridge does little for Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW There are condiments such as catsup, ranch dressing.  END
BEGIN NOW Italian vinaigrette and spicy mustard.  END
BEGIN NOW There are fifteen varieties of hot sauce.  END
BEGIN NOW There are fifteen little red bottles of capsicum extract.  END
BEGIN NOW She blinks a few times, slightly stunned.  END
BEGIN NOW Holy shit.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a lot of heat.  END
BEGIN NOW She peaks her head around the corner at the Shambles, strumming away to another place and time. END
BEGIN NOW “Fuckin’ A, you boys like it hot.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, we do.” He plucks away, unconcerned.  END
BEGIN NOW  Concentrating solely on the idea in his head for a song.  END
BEGIN NOW The song might be about a girl.  END
BEGIN NOW  The lyrics would be about how his baby is gone.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, when we say baby, we’re not referring to an infant.  END
BEGIN NOW When we say baby we’re using it as a term of endearment.  END
BEGIN NOW As a little way of saying, “I’m taking care of you, because you are a helpless little baby.  END
BEGIN NOW There is  o way you could survive without me.  END
BEGIN NOW I am your guardian.”  That’s how we say “baby” in this day and age. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel keeps looking for things that can be cooked.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a head of cabbage.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a head of cabbage.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a head of cabbage.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamnit.  END
BEGIN NOW The above poem is called, the contents of our fridge.  END
BEGIN NOW It is for sale. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel wrinkles her nose and looks for dry goods.  END
BEGIN NOW A bag of spaghetti.  END
BEGIN NOW Some ramen noodles.  END
BEGIN NOW Bag of rice.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn monastics.  END
BEGIN NOW A Mess walks into the room. END
BEGIN NOW “That motherfucker is at it again.” He groans, walking into the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW Scratching and stretching and cracking his way to the coffee pot.  END
BEGIN NOW He pours himself a cup of coffee and takes it into the bathroom.  END
BEGIN NOW “That fucking bouncy ball madman upstairs.” He closes the door, lighting a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks at the Shambles slightly confused. END
BEGIN NOW “He’s convinced there’s a man living upstairs that throws rubber balls around at certain times of the night.  END
BEGIN NOW He says that’s what it sounds like.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the only way to describe that sound.  END
BEGIN NOW But it might be drops of water coming from different directions splashing in patterns simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s for breakfast?” END
BEGIN NOW “Cabbage? And ranch dressing? This is terrible.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t eat this.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going shopping.” Laurel leaves the house and closes the door. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel walks through the parking lot and pats the Chev on its back.  END
BEGIN NOW You can rest up, old boy.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll do some walking.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes through the black gate and makes a left.  END
BEGIN NOW On the sidewalk through intermittent trees.  END
BEGIN NOW Up the street along the concrete and right until she sees a light.  END
BEGIN NOW Then another left.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel ambles down the street adjusting to the sun again.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks past all the parked cars and shuffles along with dead leaves by her feet.  END
BEGIN NOW She kicks the debris and swings her arms at her sides. END
BEGIN NOW Up ahead she sees a the outline of a tent or two.  END
BEGIN NOW That means it’s Tuesday.  END
BEGIN NOW  That means she’s in luck.  END
BEGIN NOW That means it’s farmer’s market day.  END
BEGIN NOW That means she can get in touch with a few people.  END
BEGIN NOW She enters on the west side past the man selling issues of Street Spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW He say he’s giving them away but he asks for a donation of at least a dollar.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s  ot terribly obnoxious about it.  END
BEGIN NOW But still, the paper is hardly ever worth reading.  END
BEGIN NOW A charity case for a charity paper.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing too special.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a woman selling freshly baked breads and pastas.  END
BEGIN NOW She has long brown baguettes with beautiful diagonal cuts on top.  END
BEGIN NOW There are loaves of sourdough and bags of this morning cut fettuccini.  END
BEGIN NOW Bags of around sunrise rolled out paperdelle.  END
BEGIN NOW  The woman stands behind her wares and smiles at Laurel as she passes. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a stand with fall fruits.  END
BEGIN NOW Ripe apple and pomegranates.  END
BEGIN NOW Persimmons and the last couple crops of figs.  END
BEGIN NOW A farmer selling squashes in all matter of sizes.  END
BEGIN NOW Butternuts and pumpkins, acorns and blue ballets.  END
BEGIN NOW The market smells like earth and someone cooking breakfast burritos.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a man playing slide guitar with his case open on the ground for people to drop loose change in.  END
BEGIN NOW Hopefully, the occasional dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW He plays upright with the slide on his little finger.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel passes by the small farms, each one with a decent crop to sell.  END
BEGIN NOW The people manning the booths are mostly morning in their twenties.  END
BEGIN NOW These are earthy people, always close to the soil.  END
BEGIN NOW Their skin is brown from spending most of the summer in the sun, digging and planting.  END
BEGIN NOW Harvesting and weeding.  END
BEGIN NOW Each one commited to a new ideal of old methods, pure food.  END
BEGIN NOW Sustainability is a word used often around here.  END
BEGIN NOW The ideal of using everything you can.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything at your disposal to the fullest capacity.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea is not to waste anything.  END
BEGIN NOW It makes sense.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the backlash to decades of careless consumerism.  END
BEGIN NOW This is in retaliation to people pumping all our foodstuffs with chemicals to make them last longer, stand up to unfamiliar weather, resist pests.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the culmination of years of research into the science of food and farming.  END
BEGIN NOW That we’re better off using nature to our advantage instead of trying to take advantage of  ature.  END
BEGIN NOW Go figure.  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh there you are! Hey Laurel!” A voice calls to Laurel from behind a booth.  END
BEGIN NOW A head sticks up with a ball cap and pair of sunglasses big enough to conceal the top half of her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She waves enthusiastically and Laurel smiles, heading toward her.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Nancy, what’s up?” END
BEGIN NOW “Where have you been? Everyone’s been wondering what happened.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been calling you for fucking days, Joe’s worried sick, I think Tia was about to start putting your face on milk cartons.” END
BEGIN NOW “Really? How long have I been gone?” END
BEGIN NOW “Like, a week and a half.” END
BEGIN NOW “Seriously?” END
BEGIN NOW “Seriously.” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, you should really get your phone turned back on.” END
BEGIN NOW “My phone’s been out?!” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah dude, for days.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fucking shit!” Laurel is surprised by the loudness of her voice and looks around.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost everyone knows her here, at least by sight. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW Fix it.  END
BEGIN NOW I think Joe’s over at Blue Heron’s booth.  END
BEGIN NOW You should talk to him.  END
BEGIN NOW Now.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Good idea.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, but first, where the hell have you been? What’s going on? This isn’t like you at all.” END
BEGIN NOW “Long story.  END
BEGIN NOW Basically, Roscoe was arrested a few days ago and I’ve been in hiding.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh shit.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, pretty much.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, go tell Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys work something out.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sorry to hear that.  END
BEGIN NOW Come back later, you should see the last batch of dry farms.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re beautiful and looks like we’ll only have them for one more week.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, I will.  END
BEGIN NOW Later Nancy.” Laurel waves and walks through the crowd a few booths down.  END
BEGIN NOW The other farmers nod and smile at her, some wave.  END
BEGIN NOW She waves back and walks like she’s on a mission.  END
BEGIN NOW She sees the booth up ahead and a very tall man is standing with his back towards her.  END
BEGIN NOW She does that thing people do before they have to talk to a boss.  END
BEGIN NOW She stops, regroups a little.  END
BEGIN NOW Takes a deep breath and does her best to look presentable. END
BEGIN NOW “Hi Joe.” She says. END
BEGIN NOW Joe turns around at the sound of her voice.  END
BEGIN NOW “And where the hell have you been? Is everything okay?” END
BEGIN NOW “Everything is not ok, no.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t say things are ok at all.  END
BEGIN NOW  I would say things are not so good.  END
BEGIN NOW Very bad even.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m hiding out from the police, Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m hiding from the police because my boyfriend was busted and the house may have been raided by now and I have no idea what’s going on.  END
BEGIN NOW I just found out my phone’s been dead for days.  END
BEGIN NOW  I’m living on the couch of two crazy hippies that stay up all  ight getting drunk and playing music and drawing on the walls and cooking everything with cheese and hot sauce and” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Wow, okay.  END
BEGIN NOW I get the point.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit hit the fan.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit happened all over your fan.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sorry to hear that.  END
BEGIN NOW How much time are you going to need off? I mean, it’s not terribly busy, I think we can afford to give you a vacation.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, a little vacation time is about due for you anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW You know if it was anyone else they’d be fired.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone else.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW But really, I have no idea how long I’m going to need.  END
BEGIN NOW I just found out about my fucking phone and I really need to get that turned back on.  END
BEGIN NOW But I can call you.  END
BEGIN NOW I will call you and let you know.  END
BEGIN NOW Like I probably should have when this all happened.  END
BEGIN NOW But it happened so fast and then there I was at that apartment and I must have been on a bender for days.  END
BEGIN NOW And goddamn I’m so hungry.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, hey don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Have Nancy hook you up on credit.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ll take care of you, as long as you stay in touch.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks, thanks again.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll be back later.  END
BEGIN NOW I really need to get my phone back on.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe might have called and I really need to know what’s going on.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Be that way.  END
BEGIN NOW Be a slave to your phone.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re such a materialist.” Joes gives her a look that says just kidding.  END
BEGIN NOW He gives her a look that says relax, you should probably go surfing.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what I’d do.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d go surfing.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like fun. END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll see you later, Joe.  END
BEGIN NOW Take care.” END
BEGIN NOW “You take care.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going take what I can get.” END
BEGIN NOW Laurel leaves the market and walks up Derby St towards Shattuck.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks along with the fall colors and the traffic lights and crosses about eight streets before she turns up Dwight.  END
BEGIN NOW Past rows of houses and apartment complexes, flats and all the trees that were allowed to grow in between.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks along the sidewalk humming half singing to herself and trying not so much to think about the fact that her phone has been dead for a few days and who knows what she’s missed.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe could have called.  END
BEGIN NOW Marji could have called.  END
BEGIN NOW Her employers certainly did call.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all she knew.  END
BEGIN NOW She wished she had brought the Chev along.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this would have been so easy if the Chev were here to help out. END
BEGIN NOW Dwight runs right into Telegraph.  END
BEGIN NOW  Right up a small incline and there you are.  END
BEGIN NOW All the sights and smells of a small city section of urban sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW All the action of a few long blocks.  END
BEGIN NOW Students meandering and walking around, catching up with friend and running into acquaintances.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW The students with their college sweaters and backpacks, book bags and on occasion, rolling luggage for all those overpriced paper-weighted text books.  END
BEGIN NOW All the students cramming nineteen units a semester barely getting enough sleep to survive living on loans and cheap food and the every once in a while care package from mom and dad.  END
BEGIN NOW The students are not really locals.  END
BEGIN NOW Some like to pretend that they are.  END
BEGIN NOW But they’re not from around here.  END
BEGIN NOW Their existence is only temporary.  END
BEGIN NOW A fleeting moment in the life span of a college town.  END
BEGIN NOW They come, they go.  END
BEGIN NOW Some end up sticking around, but not nearly all of them.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s just not enough room.  END
BEGIN NOW Things are crowded enough as it is.  END
BEGIN NOW If college students never left their college town it would be akin to an overpopulation problem brought about by some jackass discovering the secret to immortality and selling the result at discount drug stores for $4.99 available behind the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW People need to die and college students need to leave after graduation.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only fair to the rest of us. END
BEGIN NOW The bums are out enjoying the weather.  END
BEGIN NOW There are more cup rattlers out today than is typical.  END
BEGIN NOW They sit offering nothing in exchange for other people’s pity and spare coins.  END
BEGIN NOW They have run out of talent or steam or drive and instead sit all day long on the sidewalk, using only enough energy to shake a paper cup at you when you walk by.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them are missing more than one tooth.  END
BEGIN NOW All of them bum cigarettes of any likely looking candidate.  END
BEGIN NOW The cup rattlers make up a rhythm section from the sound of desperation.  END
BEGIN NOW The drum beat of an empty belly played on by broken fingers. END
BEGIN NOW The runaways are all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Kids that spend their time since leaving home or dropping out or just getting on a bus one day and never looking back.  END
BEGIN NOW Kids that spend their free time sitting around trying to find a way to eat.  END
BEGIN NOW These kids at least have some drive.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re not yet broken people with nothing to offer society.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them can play the guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW Others can play hand drums.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them make signs from scrap cardboard and try to come up with witty slogans in order to elicit funds from passersby.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes their efforts work fairly well.  END
BEGIN NOW But none of them are going to retire anytime soon.  END
BEGIN NOW None of them are doing much in the way of moving on.  END
BEGIN NOW More like moving from place to place.  END
BEGIN NOW More like the same scene in every city, everywhere you go.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the scenery changes slightly.  END
BEGIN NOW A black cat begins to cross Laurel’s path.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems a little less than stray, meaning he seems fat enough not to be in need.  END
BEGIN NOW  She bends at the knees and reaches towards the cat’s head.  END
BEGIN NOW He sniffs her hand with cautious optimism.  END
BEGIN NOW Ready to accept and ready to dodge depending on what the hand does.  END
BEGIN NOW Depending on how the hand smells.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel reaches down and starts petting the cat’s head.  END
BEGIN NOW He gives in greedily, turning into the pressure and purring with reckless abandon.  END
BEGIN NOW He twists his hold body against the pressure of Laurel’s scratch and ends up rolled over on his back, belly exposed and ready for more.  END
BEGIN NOW  Taking a tip, Laurel goes in for the belly rub.  END
BEGIN NOW He accepts at first and then goes into a playful mood.  END
BEGIN NOW He seizes her hand between his mouth and four paws.  END
BEGIN NOW He kicks at her with his hind legs and leaves a deep scratch on her hand from his teeth. END
BEGIN NOW “You little fucker.  END
BEGIN NOW Let go.” She smacks the black cat on the head and shoos him away. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel looks at her hand and sees red lines crossing all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW “That little bastard.”  END
BEGIN NOW If you see a cat on the sidewalk and stop to give the animal a little love.  END
BEGIN NOW If you stop what you’re doing as an act of kindness, you will only end up bleeding.  END
BEGIN NOW If you ever try to kill someone with kindness, the only person ending up dead will be you.  END
BEGIN NOW And you might have rabies. END
BEGIN NOW The shop where she needs to go to turn her phone back on is about three block ahead and up to the right for three more blocks.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not too far.  END
BEGIN NOW She can walk that in about five minutes or less.  END
BEGIN NOW The distance is of little to no consequence.  END
BEGIN NOW  The concrete will feel the same underfoot.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands erect, rubbing her torn hand and continues walking.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes a noodle shop and a few clothing stores.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes a booth where in man with wild head gear listens to Neil Young and sells patches for people to sew onto various items, proclaiming to the world their love of music by The Beatles or the degree and extent for which they loath the government.  END
BEGIN NOW This guy might have landed here in the late sixties or early seventies.  END
BEGIN NOW He has probably been selling the same set of patches for some thirty years.  END
BEGIN NOW He just might be a holdover from another era.  END
BEGIN NOW He sings along to the music and doesn’t seem to care about anything else. END
BEGIN NOW The phone store is up ahead and Laurel walks up the the glass windows, looking inside.  END
BEGIN NOW She passes through a doorway and walks up to a person standing behind the counter labeled for the service of customers.  END
BEGIN NOW The man on the other side doesn’t react in any way.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at her approaching.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s quite certain he won’t have to help her.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s pretty sure there’s an automated touch screen device in the corner that can do everything she needs to get down.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d rather not help her.  END
BEGIN NOW He will get the same paycheck regardless.  END
BEGIN NOW “My phone’s been turn off and I’d like to turn it back on.” END
BEGIN NOW “When’s the last time you paid your phone bill?” END
BEGIN NOW “Umm.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not exactly sure… But it couldn’t have been that long ago.” END
BEGIN NOW “Right behind you, to your left, is a machine for paying bills.  END
BEGIN NOW Check that first and if something still isn’t working, let me know.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d be more than happy to help.” He puts on a smile only suitable at customer service counters.  END
BEGIN NOW If that smile were anywhere else, someone would punch that smile right in the face.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the most punchable smile you will ever see.  END
BEGIN NOW The machine in the corner is behaving like things do when put into corners.  END
BEGIN NOW It hunches over, slightly slow and depressed because it has been segregated from the rest of the store.  END
BEGIN NOW No one wants to deal with the machine.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone prefers being able to negotiate with a live human being.  END
BEGIN NOW The bill paying machine stands in the corner with a dunce cap of rejection, full of self pity and bearing nothing close to good news for anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW The machine has a slot to accept money but there’s no place to dispense any.  END
BEGIN NOW The machine is a taker.  END
BEGIN NOW The only thing you will get out of this machine is a receipt.  END
BEGIN NOW A paper record of every cent the damn thing took from you. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel pushes the picture of a button, prompting the program in the machine to take her money.  END
BEGIN NOW She gives the machine her information.  END
BEGIN NOW She tells the machine her address, her phone number, the last four digits of her social security  umber.  END
BEGIN NOW She gives the machine her credit card.  END
BEGIN NOW She types in more numbers and presses the pictures of more buttons.  END
BEGIN NOW The machine gives her a receipt.  END
BEGIN NOW The reciept lists all the money it has taken from her and lists all the money Laurel, until now, owed the machine.  END
BEGIN NOW The receipt is only a reminder of how much money has gone into the machine.  END
BEGIN NOW And how much money the machine will expect next month.  END
BEGIN NOW The receipt is a very depressing piece of paper. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel pays her bill and looks at her phone expectantly.  END
BEGIN NOW She expects instant gratification.  END
BEGIN NOW Instant gratification is a concept only actualized until recently.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s still a few kinks to work out of the system.  END
BEGIN NOW Our best men are on the job.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW By the time you wake up tomorrow morning, instant gratification will be ready for you.  END
BEGIN NOW It will always have to wait until tomorrow morning.  END
BEGIN NOW And it will always be today. END
BEGIN NOW Laurel’s phone looks at nothing because it doesn’t have eyes or the required controlling devices that enable seeing through eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW There is only a screen.  END
BEGIN NOW All the screen has to offer right now is the current time.  END
BEGIN NOW Laurel might as well wear a wrist watch.  END
BEGIN NOW She eyes the man behind the counter and scowls.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes do their best to communicate spite.  END
BEGIN NOW She tries her hardest to stare straight into his soul and destroy it.  END
BEGIN NOW When her eyes make it that far she realizes there’s  o soul left to destroy.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds only the abandoned building blocks of a man.  END
BEGIN NOW No one even bothered to put up a for sale sign. END
BEGIN NOW She turns around and marches back out of the building.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks back to the sidewalk and looks around her.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a hotdog place just up the street.  END
BEGIN NOW A hot dog doesn’t sound so bad right now.  END
BEGIN NOW A hot dog or two might calm her nerves a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks up the place that doesn’t have a space to sit.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a window to order and a menu with several kinds of sausages.  END
BEGIN NOW She decides on a bratwurst and kielbasa.  END
BEGIN NOW  She waits and looks around the shop.  END
BEGIN NOW On the walls are  ewspaper articles, clippings and art all of an anarchist edge.  END
BEGIN NOW All of them anti-authoritarian and anti-government.  END
BEGIN NOW An anarchist hotdog stand.  END
BEGIN NOW How quaint, she thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Her phone buzzes to life in her pocket.  END
BEGIN NOW She has three new messages. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter thirteen; END
BEGIN NOW Reverend Carmichael stands behind the pulpit.  END
BEGIN NOW The time has come.  END
BEGIN NOW The arrival of the time for which he has prepared his sermon is right now.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks out at the congregation.  END
BEGIN NOW The rows of pews of people sitting with various levels of attention and varying lengths of attention span.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think you’d be able to correlate the lengths of the attention span to the ages of the individuals that possessed them.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think this would make a nice bell curve if graphed out.  END
BEGIN NOW But you’d be wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no concrete relationship between age and attention span.  END
BEGIN NOW The root of the attention span lies solely in the personal force and discipline of the person.  END
BEGIN NOW There is  o way around this.  END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend looks at his flock and tries not to concentrate on any of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Treat them like a herd.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t get too involved.  END
BEGIN NOW If he were not here to guide them, surely they would all find themselves wandering into traffic or over cliffs or ending up under bridges drinking wine from bottles concealed poorly in paper bags with their best friends.  END
BEGIN NOW Their best friends would be dope addicts and prostitutes.  END
BEGIN NOW The Reverend shudders and looks down at his notes.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sure that some of you still watch the news.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure that there’s a group of you that gossip about the goings on in the world, and the world around you and matters relating to the church and thinking all the time that the end is  ear and we are all in grave danger.  END
BEGIN NOW That the Antichrist walks amongst us even now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure that in this very parish there are a few of you that walk the streets with smug expressions thinking that you are saved and when the day finally comes, you will be whisked to Heaven to sit at the right hand of Christ and bask in his holy glory.  END
BEGIN NOW “I have been watching the news for the last few days.  END
BEGIN NOW The watching has caused me grief and pains for these times that we live in.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure some of you have heard of the burnings.  END
BEGIN NOW For those of you that haven’t heard, allow me to summarize.  END
BEGIN NOW “Starting in the panhandle of Texas sometime last year, there were a series of churches burned to the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW All of them along the major highways.  END
BEGIN NOW The police reports attributed the fires to faulty wiring.  END
BEGIN NOW To years of neglected electrical work that was bound to fail at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW However, now, in the light of repetition and too many instances to ignore, we know this to be the work of a group of people.  END
BEGIN NOW A group of people that are at war with God. END
BEGIN NOW “The fires started in Texas and continued west along the highways, through New Mexico and Arizona, to Southern California and recently have started spreading north.” A murmur rises from the pews.  END
BEGIN NOW The people relay information from relatives from the areas.  END
BEGIN NOW Spreading loose information garnered from speculation on behalf of a few local newspapers.  END
BEGIN NOW The people in the pews accept this information as pure fact. END
BEGIN NOW “I know what many of you might be thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW I know this is frightening news and the possibility of this very church, this very house of God being targeted by these devil worshipers is very real.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a good parish, and you are all good citizens.  END
BEGIN NOW They have every reason to hate you and what you stand for.  END
BEGIN NOW You are the backbone of this community.  END
BEGIN NOW  Our charity work has saved lives and brought countless people back on their feet.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve feed and clothed the poor, tended to the sick and needy.  END
BEGIN NOW Our report card is near flawless.  END
BEGIN NOW And this makes the Satanists very angry.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not a matter of pride.  END
BEGIN NOW  I feel that we, as a community, see this as the way things ought to be.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re just doing as we should and it’s nothing special.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re just trying to be decent people and give and serve as Christ intended.  END
BEGIN NOW But there are always enemies.  END
BEGIN NOW There is always an opposition.  END
BEGIN NOW “Satan works in powerful, evil ways on the minds of the weak.  END
BEGIN NOW He instills ideas of harm and hate and violence on those that have not guarded themselves from the attacks of the Morning Star.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not saying we should live in fear, and neither am I saying we should walk with arrogance that we are immune to the charms of the Great Deceiver.  END
BEGIN NOW The Father of lies has his agents everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW And we must be on our guard.” More murmuring encircles the congregation. END
BEGIN NOW “These poor, terrible people that haven’t accepted Christ in their lives.  END
BEGIN NOW This is what happens when people are careless with their minds!  This is what happens, when we let our children grow up, sparing them the rod, sparing them common sense, sparing them the concept of consequences.  END
BEGIN NOW “In school they are taught that every action has an equal and opposite reaction.  END
BEGIN NOW That everything you do will come back to you.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only a matter of time.  END
BEGIN NOW Brothers and Sisters, we live in a time of fear.  END
BEGIN NOW We live in an age where we have become so comfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW We have become so lazy in our certainty, so full of pride in ourselves and how powerful man has become.  END
BEGIN NOW We have become like this because we have forgotten about God.  END
BEGIN NOW We have forgotten to give credit to the Most High, the only person to whom credit is due.  END
BEGIN NOW We have forgotten that we are nothing except God’s children. END
BEGIN NOW “Brothers and Sisters.  END
BEGIN NOW When you go home today.  END
BEGIN NOW When you are having dinner with your family.  END
BEGIN NOW Be grateful.  END
BEGIN NOW Give thanks to God for their company, their lives, their existence.  END
BEGIN NOW  Pray to God that he might deliver us from the Satanists.  END
BEGIN NOW Pray that the Satanists find their way, pray they are not lost forever.  END
BEGIN NOW Pray that they see the light.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter fourteen: END
BEGIN NOW Spencer see’s the light coming from the sign of the Motel Six Hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW He finds room sixty-six and knocks five times.  END
BEGIN NOW Five knocks resonate from the other side of the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer knocks twice and is answered twice.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer knocks three more times and the door opens. END
BEGIN NOW “The last three knocks on my side are totally unnecessary.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know who thought that up.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s obviously you and I’m obviously me, and I see no reason whatsoever for any formalities beyond just enough for security purposes and basic verification.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I do have little porthole, I could see you before I opened up.  END
BEGIN NOW But still.  END
BEGIN NOW  You could have been someone disguised just like you.  END
BEGIN NOW  Maybe someone stole your face.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s possible.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the guys on the team knows a guy who knows a guy.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those things.” The man behind the door stands blinking into the parking lot.  END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus Christ, Spence.  END
BEGIN NOW How much whiskey did you drink before you got here?” END
BEGIN NOW “Jusst Enough.” He made sure Enough was capitalized.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s exactly how he said it.  END
BEGIN NOW And he said it while allowing himself into the motel room.  END
BEGIN NOW He sat on the arm chair provided courteously by the Motel Six Hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW He sat on it as if he owned it. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, if you’re drunk, you’re drunk and I certainly can’t change that.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not a big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW If you want to do business with a head full of whiskey and a van full of stiffs, that’s not my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW How are they? Are they still fresh?” END
BEGIN NOW “They are cold and they are dead and there’s twoo of them.” Spencer holds up two fingers to emphasis his ability to count corpses.  END
BEGIN NOW  He smiles at the man, still standing by the door, now closed.  END
BEGIN NOW Now behind which the man that opened comes into view.  END
BEGIN NOW He stands taller than he looks.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably because he has excellent posture.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not the type of person that slouches often and when he catches himself in a slouch, he’s sure to straight that up right away, as if he lingered any longer in such a position the swift disciplinary action of an authority figure would send nothing but pain into his nervous system.  END
BEGIN NOW The man straightens his posture as if flinching.  END
BEGIN NOW A sudden jerking whole body motion into a militariesque stance.  END
BEGIN NOW  His face is mostly beard.  END
BEGIN NOW The beard takes up most of the real estate from the ears to his chin.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a small hill of a  ose arising out of the bushes.  END
BEGIN NOW His mouth looks more like a cave strung with creeper vines and moss overgrowth.  END
BEGIN NOW The hair from his head and the hair from his beard mingle together and make braids, make knots, mingle and tangle and turn into a cohesive whole composed of many parts.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes would be called piercing in a less inspired description.  END
BEGIN NOW  No one was ever aware of his eyebrows.  END
BEGIN NOW He would be called lanky by most people.  END
BEGIN NOW And by most people, we’re talking about the people that wouldn’t call him hairy.  END
BEGIN NOW A very small percentage of people.  END
BEGIN NOW His voiced betrayed the subtlest hint of an accent.  END
BEGIN NOW A holdover from moving around a lot as a child.  END
BEGIN NOW Of being in either Seattle with his father or British Columbia with his mother.  END
BEGIN NOW He no longer notices when he slips in and out of certain dialects that would ordinarily distinguish him from other people.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well then shit, what’s left to do? It’s not like we have paperwork or anything.” The tall, hairy man looks at Spence who sits, giggling on his chair.  END
BEGIN NOW “I suppose you just want some money to get a little drunker?” END
BEGIN NOW Spence looks up when he says money.  END
BEGIN NOW “Filthy fuckin’ bank notes.  END
BEGIN NOW Necessary filth! God! Jesus motherfucking Christ.  END
BEGIN NOW Money.” END
BEGIN NOW “You know that when you say it like that it’s offensive in at least three ways? You’re blaspheming Jesus, the holy virgin, and implying an incestuous relationship between the two.  END
BEGIN NOW Calling Jesus a motherfucker is pretty high up there.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s some deep rooted blasphemy you got going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Good job.” END
BEGIN NOW Spencer laughs a little louder at this.  END
BEGIN NOW “You have no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I should tell you about my hobby sometime.  END
BEGIN NOW Some other time when you have beer to offer me.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I’m not much for the drink, as we tend to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Keeps the brain slow and stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW Keeps the motivation stifled.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, that’s you guys and this is me.  END
BEGIN NOW Whiskey soaked and smiling away.  END
BEGIN NOW Will those two get me enough gas money to make it to L.A.  END
BEGIN NOW and back in time for the holidays?”  END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I think you should have plenty.  END
BEGIN NOW Depending on much you end up spending on booze and whatever other drugs you  eed to get through the day.  END
BEGIN NOW Or you know, whores, whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever makes you happy.  END
BEGIN NOW Not my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW You should have more than enough for these two.  END
BEGIN NOW Going to gather a few more from down south, make the rounds back up and get a few more? We appreciate all you’ve done for us, really.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m  ot going to say we couldn’t have done it without you, but you’re doing wonderful work.  END
BEGIN NOW Really.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re helping a lot of people.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re all very grateful for your work.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ve helped save quite a few lives.” END
BEGIN NOW Spencer begins laughing a little in his chair.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yessir.  END
BEGIN NOW I dig ‘em, you heal ‘em.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the deal.  END
BEGIN NOW He he hee.” Spencer shifts in the chair, being not quite drunk enough to be comfortable anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW “How the hell have you guys managed to do this anyway? Seems like if someone was able to cure cancer than it would be a big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW The  ews would be all over the story.  END
BEGIN NOW Nations would be clamoring and so on.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well… I’m not really at liberty to discuss the actual method.  END
BEGIN NOW I will say that it’s a kind of old science meets new science meets heavy experimentation and a few very stoned revelations.  END
BEGIN NOW All that matters is that it works.  END
BEGIN NOW All that matters is that we have results and people the scans prove the cancer is gone and hasn’t come back in any of the test subjects.  END
BEGIN NOW The method is functional.  END
BEGIN NOW Although a bit macabre.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, corpses n’ shit.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about as macabre as it gets.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s some pretty morbid shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, really.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that I mind.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, not that it’s really a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t quite expecting this when I answered the ad, but hey.  END
BEGIN NOW Life is full of surprises.  END
BEGIN NOW Know what I mean?” END
BEGIN NOW “All too well.  END
BEGIN NOW All too well.” They sit in the motel room like it’s someone else’s turn to make a move.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence gets that feeling that maybe he’s overstayed his welcome.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he’s just drunk and around an all too sober person.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that bartender was pretty cute.  END
BEGIN NOW And maybe he could really use a hotdog or three and then more drinks. END
BEGIN NOW “Well then.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s do some transferring.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s unload the stiffs and exchange values and be on our ways.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m so fuckin’ hungry.” Spence belches quietly to himself. END
BEGIN NOW “Very well.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve dawdled long enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s to the parking lot.  END
BEGIN NOW  Get this over with.” The tree of a man opens the door again, waiting for Spencer to get on both feet in such a way that suggests the slightest hint of stability.  END
BEGIN NOW This takes a few moments. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh there I am.” He says with pride, achieving balance. END
BEGIN NOW They walk into the lights of the parking lot and the motel sign and find their respective vehicles.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence unlocks the back doors and looks around for signs of trouble and authority and any hint that their little operation will be noticed.  END
BEGIN NOW Hauling bodies from one van to another in the early evening can be a tricky business.  END
BEGIN NOW The Tree backs his van up near the rear of Spencer’s, making the distance between the two just enough to haul the bodies.  END
BEGIN NOW Both sets of doors open and they help each other with the corpses, passing them along.  END
BEGIN NOW Just shipping some goods over national borders.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing out of the ordinary.  END
BEGIN NOW Business as usual. END
BEGIN NOW “Excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW They hardly even smell.” The lanky tree headed man takes out what looks like a cigarette and lights it, looking up at the sky and blowing a thick cloud of white smoke heavenward.  END
BEGIN NOW “Long ass drive tonight, and I really do need to get started.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a pleasure.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks again, Spence.  END
BEGIN NOW And have your guy call our guy when you get a few more.  END
BEGIN NOW Business is picking up a little.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re going to need, maybe four, five more within the next month if you can manage.” He hands Spencer two thousand dollars in twenties, rolled into five hundred dollar wads. END
BEGIN NOW “Oohwee.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s some cash right there.” Spence is coming out of nearly cross eyed and looking at the cash in hand.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, L.A.  END
BEGIN NOW and back no problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks ah, I didn’t get your name man.” END
BEGIN NOW “You really don’t need it.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we’ll meet again, maybe it will be someone else  ext time.  END
BEGIN NOW If you really need a frame of reference, call me Ross.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW That works for me.  END
BEGIN NOW Since you know my name and all, figures I should have something to call you.  END
BEGIN NOW Or refer to you by in passing.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t exactly say ‘the strange Canadian with the bushy face and lanky frame.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’d probably get you further than Ross if you ever need to relate this experience.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Be that way.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I will.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a more or less constant.” END
BEGIN NOW “So, not really constant at all, is that what you’re trying to say?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not trying to say anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just saying it.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s really no trying at all.” END
BEGIN NOW “You have a point.  END
BEGIN NOW I think.  END
BEGIN NOW That works for me.” END
BEGIN NOW “You know Spence, I don’t know why you’re helping us.  END
BEGIN NOW I really don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW  And maybe I shouldn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe that’s really none of my business.  END
BEGIN NOW But I’m sure you have your reasons.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you just like grave robbing.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you like the thrill of it all.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you’re just a criminal and a drunk and you have nothing better to do.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW And I’m not so sure that I really care.  END
BEGIN NOW But you should really think about what you’re doing and why.  END
BEGIN NOW For all you know, I’m a necrophiliac.  END
BEGIN NOW For all you know I’m just a pervert with a fat pocket book and I’m going to take these two dead bodies back to a room somewhere or park my van on the side of the road and fuck the cold shit out of them.  END
BEGIN NOW I might be a Satanist and could be performing rituals that would bring about the Apocalypse.  END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever considered that? That maybe this whole cancer research line is just a put on? That you might just be bringing about the end of the world? Or the end of days? Or just ushering a new era for humanity?” END
BEGIN NOW Spencer looks at him sideways.  END
BEGIN NOW Not exactly from the side, or tilting his head sideways.  END
BEGIN NOW More like cockeyed, or that look that says, ‘Mister, you sure did just talk a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW And I really don’t know exactly what you just said, but it sounded like a lot of information.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounded like some heavy shit you just laid on me.  END
BEGIN NOW And I really don’t know what to do with that.  END
BEGIN NOW So I’m just going to say,’ “Man.  END
BEGIN NOW How much does that really matter? I’ve got two grand in my pocket right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I pay gas money instead of rent.  END
BEGIN NOW And if everything works out, I’m about to turn most of this in three or four grand more.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I can.  END
BEGIN NOW What you do with those bodies is your business.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t care less.” END
BEGIN NOW Instead of all that, Spencer just says, “I can dig.” And he nods solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW “Suit yourself.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I do.  END
BEGIN NOW I do.”  And with that, Spencer waves goodbye over his shoulder, walking away from the parking lot and The Motel Six Hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW  Walking across the street and feeling the desire for another drink after all that talking.  END
BEGIN NOW Another drink and then think about those hot dogs or maybe someone will deliver to the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds reasonable. END
BEGIN NOW Ross smokes his joint and watches him leave.  END
BEGIN NOW He leans on his van and watches a self contained unit with hardly a care in the world make his way back to the bar for more poison and more.  END
BEGIN NOW Just more.  END
BEGIN NOW Because there’s never enough of anything for him.  END
BEGIN NOW He will always be content and never be satisfied.  END
BEGIN NOW  Ross gets in the van and starts the engine.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulls out of the parking lot and points the vehicles north.  END
BEGIN NOW For science. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Fifteen: END
BEGIN NOW The ranch house maintained.  END
BEGIN NOW The ranch house survived.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a carbon copy of the floor plan across the street and slight variations all over the neighborhood.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a typical suburban landscape.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone with fences.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone with a small front yard and small back yard.  END
BEGIN NOW Tiled kitchen counters and linoleum kitchen floors.  END
BEGIN NOW Inoffensive carpet with the occasionally offensive stain.  END
BEGIN NOW Brick porches.  END
BEGIN NOW Slate rock patios.  END
BEGIN NOW Lawns and lawns and lawn mowing boys earning money for concerts and cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW The neighborhood boys have declined as a local work force over the years.  END
BEGIN NOW Out of the window of her not so unique ranch house, Juniper Marie Gladstone has watched the local boys being replaced by scruffy aliens.  END
BEGIN NOW Not alien in the sense of extraterrestrial.  END
BEGIN NOW  Alien in the sense of certainly not Americans.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever that means.  END
BEGIN NOW The not Americans mowed the neighbor’s lawn with a sense of detached apathy.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was just walking around the yard, pushing a machine with a motor that chopped the grass to equal lengths and some of it managed to ascend into a collection bag.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the clippings fell back on the lawn.  END
BEGIN NOW Where they would sit until they dried and died and went back to the earth.  END
BEGIN NOW  It was the kind of lawn that no one played on any more.  END
BEGIN NOW Even in the summer with the overbearing heat and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The sprinklers were never ran through anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids didn’t have much use for it.  END
BEGIN NOW There were places to play farther from home.  END
BEGIN NOW Places with flashing lights and loud music and instant returns for monetary exchanges. END
BEGIN NOW Jun stands at the window, sipping at a cup of tea and look slightly distraught.  END
BEGIN NOW  She furrows her brow and wrinkles her  ose and twists her lips to one side, looking out the window. END
BEGIN NOW “Juniper, dear, staring out that window isn’t going to solve anything.” A woman sits at Jun’s table, sipping at her own cup of tea and delicately nibbling away at a small sugar cookie.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s the kind of woman that never ventures out of the house without a hat.  END
BEGIN NOW  She the kind of woman you see in supermarket checkout lanes with well over fifteen items and coupons for every single thing.  END
BEGIN NOW She will commandeer the attention and instigate the increasing vexation, of all who have to deal with her from the other side of the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a menace in a floral print dress. END
BEGIN NOW “I know.  END
BEGIN NOW I know deary.  END
BEGIN NOW But I can’t help but wonder.” END
BEGIN NOW “About what pray tell?” END
BEGIN NOW “About these kids.  END
BEGIN NOW These kids today.  END
BEGIN NOW I think there’s something wrong with them.” END
BEGIN NOW “Juniper, darling, there’s always something wrong with the children.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter where or when.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, yes Constance, I realize that.  END
BEGIN NOW But these days I’m thinking it’s worse than it used to be.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t seem to have a care for god.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t have respect for their elders.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re out of control and possibly malicious.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t trust them.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, Juniper, you’re over reacting.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re just kids, being kids.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s nothing unusual.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not so different from when we were kids.” END
BEGIN NOW “When we were kids? Goodness gracious.  END
BEGIN NOW Did I really just hear you say that? Just like when we were kids.  END
BEGIN NOW My golly.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, I don’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think so at all.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids are all into that awful music with the loud thumping.  END
BEGIN NOW And that language.  END
BEGIN NOW Why I can’t understand what they’re saying half the time, talking so fast like that.  END
BEGIN NOW And when I do understand all I hear are terrible things.  END
BEGIN NOW The words they use.  END
BEGIN NOW Would have made Robert blush.  END
BEGIN NOW Certainly not nice things at all.  END
BEGIN NOW And if they can’t say something nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, you know.  END
BEGIN NOW “And how they dress! Sakes alive Constance.  END
BEGIN NOW They dress like clowns and prostitutes.” She says prostitutes as if she were about to throw up and was debating what to do with the contents of her mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW “I can’t understand it, I really can’t.  END
BEGIN NOW I suspect they may all be devil worshippers.” END
BEGIN NOW “Really now Jun.  END
BEGIN NOW Devil worshippers? Satanists?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh my yes.  END
BEGIN NOW Listen.  END
BEGIN NOW I was in church last Sunday, and the reverend was talking about how all these churches in Texas and Arizona and New Mexico were being burned to the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just one or two.  END
BEGIN NOW  We’re talking somewhere around fifty or sixty.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re calling it an epidemic.  END
BEGIN NOW The most churches burned in a short span of time in recorded history.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re saying that there’s a group of covert Satanists that are trying to take god away from everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW They are burning the churches until there’s no where left to worship.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a plague, Connie.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even in the South have they seen something like this.” END
BEGIN NOW “My goodness! Was anyone hurt? Did they leave any markings? You know, graffiti?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t think so no.  END
BEGIN NOW But I heard from Abigail that her sister’s church near N- was burned to the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing left but ashes and the foundation.  END
BEGIN NOW She said the preacher’s cat was caught in the basement and died from the fumes, but other than that no one was hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW  She said they didn’t leave any sign and there’s no evidence there was anyone was there.  END
BEGIN NOW The church burned as if by an act of the Devil.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m telling you, the kids these days are turning evil.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not so sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it’s not the kids.  END
BEGIN NOW There could be some older people involved.  END
BEGIN NOW You remember James? Ella’s uncle? He was a black magician.  END
BEGIN NOW Ella told me that she found all these books and weird drawings.  END
BEGIN NOW All in the attic where he spent so much time.  END
BEGIN NOW Very strange business.  END
BEGIN NOW But he wasn’t a Satanist.” END
BEGIN NOW “Wasn’t a Satanist.  END
BEGIN NOW Listen to yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a black magician, how is that any different?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, I don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW Ella had a way of explaining it that made a kind of sense.  END
BEGIN NOW She was very good at that kind of thing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I don’t trust it.  END
BEGIN NOW Satanists and these kids with no respect at all.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole country is going to pot.” Juniper sips her tea and takes a cookie from the plate.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t take a bite but rather sets it down next to her tea, as if she took the cookie prematurely, in expectation of wanting it sometime in the near future but not quite yet.  END
BEGIN NOW The cookie sits by the tea wanting nothing, not noticing the negligence bestowed upon it. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter sixteen: END
BEGIN NOW County jail is not the most civilized of places.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone wears a uniform in county jail.  END
BEGIN NOW Either a jumpsuit or a collared shirt with a badge and gun or a name tag with a pen.  END
BEGIN NOW Hardly anyone smiles in county.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not a lot of reasons for anyone to smile.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe has an orange jumpsuit on.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s had the same orange jump suit on for much too long.  END
BEGIN NOW  They gave him the jumpsuit and took everything else.  END
BEGIN NOW His clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW His wallet.  END
BEGIN NOW They took his Identification card and gave him a number.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a room in county that looks and feels just like a similar room at the Department of Motor Vehicles.  END
BEGIN NOW The same hard plastic chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW The same small windows where uniformed employees take your prints, take a picture, make you fill out forms and sign them.  END
BEGIN NOW The waiting rooms were designed by the same guy.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea is make whoever is in this room loose all concept of time.  END
BEGIN NOW Take away the sunlight and install energy saving fluorescents with low wattage output.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep the room a little on the dim side except for the other side of the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW Give the police some backlighting for dramatic stage presence.  END
BEGIN NOW And give them something to stand on.  END
BEGIN NOW Make them a little taller than whoever is on the other side.  END
BEGIN NOW Standing on the other side will feel like being the presence of a parent, confronting you about your wrong doing.  END
BEGIN NOW Being on the other side of the counter you will have to look up at a face in front of a light.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be scared.  END
BEGIN NOW This is textbook intimidation tactics.  END
BEGIN NOW  The best thing to do right now is to take in the details.  END
BEGIN NOW Absorb every instance, every face, what hangs on the walls, the pattern in the floors.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t be terribly concerned with the person behind the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not here to help you.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just doing a job.  END
BEGIN NOW Just keeping the books and booking you.  END
BEGIN NOW Being in booking isn’t the type of job that people can really enjoy.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not a whole lot of ways to be happy in the work place.  END
BEGIN NOW When you job is to file and keep track of prisoners, when the way that you pay rent involves treating people like cattle, there’s not a lot of options with it comes to down personal satisfaction at your place of employment. END
BEGIN NOW After booking, Roscoe was allowed to change his clothes and use the restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW There were no mirrors in the restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW Had there been, if someone had wanted the prisoners to get one last look at themselves before being hauled away to their cell, before being taken to the yard; Roscoe would have seen himself reflected all wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW The hues in his face wouldn’t not be normal.  END
BEGIN NOW Years of farm work, of working in the sun and planting vegetables gave him a dark complexion.  END
BEGIN NOW Years of lifting bags of mulch and soil, planting seeds, watering, weeding, harvesting.  END
BEGIN NOW His appearance is normally athletic and tanned.  END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror he’s hunched, his face is showing signs of sleep deprivation.  END
BEGIN NOW Sunken eyes, heavy lids, hollow cheeks.  END
BEGIN NOW  His complexion is fading rapidly due to malnourishment and a lack of sun or sleep. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t know how long he’s been away.  END
BEGIN NOW Could have been hours.  END
BEGIN NOW Could have been days.  END
BEGIN NOW No one tells him and they took his watch.  END
BEGIN NOW He follows a guard to his cell.  END
BEGIN NOW They walk down a long hallway lined with cells.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the men behind bars sit around staring at the walls or out of their cages.  END
BEGIN NOW Some stand or lean around looking at things.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the inmates read whatever they can.  END
BEGIN NOW Old newspapers magazines.  END
BEGIN NOW Books from a small library of donated literature. END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe eyes everything nervously.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s too soft for this.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not a criminal.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of these people may have stabbed someone or raped someone.  END
BEGIN NOW Thieves and liars, murderers, junkies, and god knows what else.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not like them, he thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not a real criminal.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t belong here.  END
BEGIN NOW This has to be a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW I want a fucking lawyer Goddamnit.  END
BEGIN NOW I  eed to call Laurel.  END
BEGIN NOW But shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Wait.  END
BEGIN NOW If I only get one phone call should I call Laurel or a lawyer? I suppose one could call the other.  END
BEGIN NOW And Laurel would be fucking pissed if I didn’t call her first.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe they have her too.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe she got roped in as well.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh man.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s going to be so mad at me.  END
BEGIN NOW This really fucking sucks.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe kicks along to the cell.  END
BEGIN NOW Not accepting his present reality.  END
BEGIN NOW Denying all the way until the doors clang shut behind him and all he has now, his only possessions are a jumpsuit and a wristband.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, he thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, at least there’s books.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s something to do.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess the biggest problem here is just passing the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t lose your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Stay calm and evaluate the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW See what can be done.  END
BEGIN NOW The guard makes sure everything is secure and starts walking away. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey man, don’t I get a phone call or something?” END
BEGIN NOW “A what?” The guard doesn’t answer.  END
BEGIN NOW The reply comes from a few cells down.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice sounds like it belongs to a very large man.  END
BEGIN NOW The guard laughs a little.  END
BEGIN NOW Not in the jovial sense.  END
BEGIN NOW Not in the sense of something funny.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs condescendingly.  END
BEGIN NOW  He laughs because Roscoe is just another poor bastard with delusions of jail being something like what he saw on television or a movie once.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs because as of right now, Roscoe really doesn’t have any rights.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s more or less a bed time story the belongs outside of these walls.  END
BEGIN NOW “Do you really think you get a phone call, motherfucker?” END
BEGIN NOW Several other inmates laugh in the same manner.  END
BEGIN NOW They chuckle and ridicule Roscoe in his naivety.  END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe is like child that’s wondered into a bad scene.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wondering if this is the place where people get raped.  END
BEGIN NOW He heard from one of his acquaintances that the best thing to do when you go to prison is pick out the toughest looking guy and just fight him without warning.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter if you win or lose.  END
BEGIN NOW You will have gained respect.  END
BEGIN NOW And chances are, no one will fuck with you after that.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not that Roscoe is physically weak, more like he’s pacifist.  END
BEGIN NOW And he’s kind of a pussy. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh ho, a new feller.” A tired voice behind him startles the crap out of him.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost literally.  END
BEGIN NOW  He turns to the shadows and sees something like a face, ill lit and grinning at him in a way.  END
BEGIN NOW “Ya look like yer ‘bout ta piss yerself, ahaw heh haw haw.” The face creeps slightly into the light and Roscoe see’s something almost human.  END
BEGIN NOW The face has been long forgotten.  END
BEGIN NOW No one has seen to care for this face for a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW His face is like an envelope containing a love letter, sitting in the dead letter section of the post office with not enough postage.  END
BEGIN NOW No one has bothered to dust the envelope in years.  END
BEGIN NOW The dust lies everywhere, especially on the overlooked letters that no one has bothered to overlook. END
BEGIN NOW A pair of eyes with wolf yellow mucas sick green tint glower from the darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW A voice creeps along the floor towards Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW In large communal showers, there’s a large drain in the middle.  END
BEGIN NOW Over the corse of a day the dead skin, the hair, blood, the semen collect on the walls and the concrete or tiled floors.  END
BEGIN NOW At the end of the day, there’s a man that comes to clean out the showers with a high pressured hose.  END
BEGIN NOW He sprays up all the remains and reminders of of the bodies that came here to bathe.  END
BEGIN NOW The water collects this mass of leftovers and pushes the whole thing towards the center drain.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how the voice creeps towards Roscoe. END
BEGIN NOW “Say new feller.  END
BEGIN NOW Say.  END
BEGIN NOW Whaddaya think? I mean, so far.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, there’s only so much you could have taken in by now.  END
BEGIN NOW But say, exactly, what does it do for you? First impressions.  END
BEGIN NOW Et cetera.” He waits an unnaturally long time looking at Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW Our boy is standing still, clutching his jumpsuit and looking wide eyed at his new roommate. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t belong here.” Roscoe lies. END
BEGIN NOW “None of us do my boy.  END
BEGIN NOW A heech.  END
BEGIN NOW None the lot of us.” The face in the darkness looks down.  END
BEGIN NOW He might has just closed his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW In this light, it’s not so clear.  END
BEGIN NOW In this light he could be doing anything with his hands.  END
BEGIN NOW He could be doing anything at all.  END
BEGIN NOW  “You might as well sit down.  END
BEGIN NOW Get used to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Say, hey new feller.  END
BEGIN NOW Heh.  END
BEGIN NOW This your first time? You never been around these parts before yeah?  Mighty scared I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, lookacha.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Look like you done seen five ghosts all raping the ghost of your dead mother.  END
BEGIN NOW But don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re just ghosts.  END
BEGIN NOW Their rules are not our rules.  END
BEGIN NOW They live, er, well I suppose it’s not really living.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be that they’re stuck in the process of dying.  END
BEGIN NOW I could see that as a reasonable solution.  END
BEGIN NOW Stuck in the middle of the whole ordeal.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither here nor there.  END
BEGIN NOW Ya ever been neither here  or there? I’m there all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW If I could get mail at that kind of address, why.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d just settle in and take down the rent sign.  END
BEGIN NOW Seems like the right kind of place for me.  END
BEGIN NOW Right in between.  END
BEGIN NOW Never quite settled, but ya know, always settled on being unsettled.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Something kind of not quite a nature.  END
BEGIN NOW Something unnatural maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s where I am.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that means this is here.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, feller.  END
BEGIN NOW New feller that you are.  END
BEGIN NOW Hardly know what you’ve got yourself into.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to be a bit strange acclimating yourself to this kind of place.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s lots of new rules.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of  ew people to meet and get used to.  END
BEGIN NOW We are all living together.  END
BEGIN NOW And finding all that stuff out.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots to do.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be plenty busy.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe you me.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe everything I say.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a trust worthy kinda guy.  END
BEGIN NOW First thing you should know.  END
BEGIN NOW Beware of people that call you ‘buddy’.  END
BEGIN NOW  Anyone that calls you buddy is not your buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW Not your friend at all.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost an enemy.  END
BEGIN NOW But definetly someone to be wary of.  END
BEGIN NOW Won’t hesitate to stab you in the back if it seems like a good idea at the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Watch out for those guys.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re easy to spot.  END
BEGIN NOW The other ones are the ones that limp.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a good reason that they limp around.  END
BEGIN NOW Trust me on this.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think I could explain them to you.  END
BEGIN NOW  I mean, logically speaking.  END
BEGIN NOW The limp is a side effect of their lifestyle.  END
BEGIN NOW Mighty terrible.  END
BEGIN NOW Terrible people.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t believe those guys.  END
BEGIN NOW They will fuck you up.  END
BEGIN NOW If you know what I mean.  END
BEGIN NOW And I think you do.  END
BEGIN NOW Just be on your guard.  END
BEGIN NOW Speaking of guards.  END
BEGIN NOW Speaking of.  END
BEGIN NOW Those guys are not human.  END
BEGIN NOW They look and walk and talk like human beings.  END
BEGIN NOW Like fellow men.  END
BEGIN NOW But there’s something wrong with their brains.  END
BEGIN NOW  Makes them behave in terrible ways.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes them act like god’s own agents of death and might.  END
BEGIN NOW Angels of vengeance and wrath.  END
BEGIN NOW More like goons of the state.  END
BEGIN NOW The fucking state with its goons.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why we’re all here.  END
BEGIN NOW State goons.  END
BEGIN NOW Brainless savages.  END
BEGIN NOW  Nothing but thugs.  END
BEGIN NOW You think there’s thugs behind bars.  END
BEGIN NOW You should see the bastards guarding the bars.  END
BEGIN NOW Make most of us look like sweet little children in comparison.  END
BEGIN NOW  Make most of us look like fresh out of Sunday school, still in plaid, still wondering what the hell the preacher was blah blah blahing about.  END
BEGIN NOW  See, listen, ya feel me? We’re pretty innocent in comparison to these guys.  END
BEGIN NOW The slave drivers are the enemy and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW The masters that makes the rules and what not.  END
BEGIN NOW Those guys are the ones to fear.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones with the billy clubs and the guns and shiney little badges that give them all the right in the world to crack your head open because they claim you were resisting arrest and you claim that you were just walking home and suddenly they want to know what you’re doing, and where you’re going and what’s in your pockets.  END
BEGIN NOW And then they’ll run your ID.  END
BEGIN NOW And find out you have a warrant and then here you are.  END
BEGIN NOW Back in the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW Those assholes.  END
BEGIN NOW  I can’t believe what power has done.  END
BEGIN NOW And these are men we’re talking about.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re talking about fellow human beings here.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like you an’ me.  END
BEGIN NOW Except you know, not so much locked up.  END
BEGIN NOW Still free to do as they please.  END
BEGIN NOW Still free to pay rent and have families and move on with life.  END
BEGIN NOW But not us.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so much.  END
BEGIN NOW Those bastards have decided that the likes of us ain’t no good out there.  END
BEGIN NOW Like they’ll decide who’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Like life has a guest list all of a sudden.  END
BEGIN NOW  Goddamn state.  END
BEGIN NOW With clubs and mace.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll tell you.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll have you know.  END
BEGIN NOW There, out there.  END
BEGIN NOW Where the enforcers are.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not civilization.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not civilized.  END
BEGIN NOW You tell me that’s civilized and I’ll clock you in the jaw.  END
BEGIN NOW Civilized.  END
BEGIN NOW Puh.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll take my cell and my meal a day and an hour in the yard.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll take that and some good time to stare at the sky and dream a while.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW That seems fairly civil to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Just feed me and let me dream.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all I ask.  END
BEGIN NOW God.  END
BEGIN NOW Who brought on this nightmare? And here.  END
BEGIN NOW Here of all places.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re so full of dopemen.  END
BEGIN NOW Just dopes selling dope and getting in trouble for it.  END
BEGIN NOW What a reason to be here.  END
BEGIN NOW What a stupid reason to lock someone up.  END
BEGIN NOW For doing a little business.  END
BEGIN NOW A little supply and demand.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not right.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s controlling the market.  END
BEGIN NOW Only certain drugs from certain people are allowed on the market.  END
BEGIN NOW Men don’t have the capacity to decide for themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why we have doctors and judges and po-leese men.  END
BEGIN NOW To help us make up our stupid minds.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we’re inferior.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how they can get away with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we buy into their crap.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t understand.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t understand how we’re so advanced.  END
BEGIN NOW So civilized.  END
BEGIN NOW And still we keep buying all this useless crap.  END
BEGIN NOW We buy it from the state and the shopping malls.  END
BEGIN NOW We buy from the TV late at night.  END
BEGIN NOW We buy it from the preachers.  END
BEGIN NOW When did we lose common sense and faith in ourselves? Tell me new feller.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell me when we the people became so weak as to need another head, unconnected to our own to make up our minds for us.  END
BEGIN NOW To know what’s best and what’s safe and heaven forbid you go through life with all the danger intact.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be disasterous.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone would die.  END
BEGIN NOW We must protect us from ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW So we create committees and watch groups and a police force to keep us in line.  END
BEGIN NOW Because obviously we’re just a bunch of morons running around with our dicks in our own asses trying to make up from down and trying to go left and right at every intersection simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW  Freedom.  END
BEGIN NOW Puh.  END
BEGIN NOW What a dirty word.  END
BEGIN NOW There isn’t a people on earth that have ever known freedom.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a few individuals.  END
BEGIN NOW But as a group.  END
BEGIN NOW As a whole or sections of a whole.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a one.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe you me.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a one.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re all too fucking stupid to see it.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, I don’t need my hand held.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been around the block.  END
BEGIN NOW I know what’s up and what’s going down.  END
BEGIN NOW Take my word for it.  END
BEGIN NOW Ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what this is.  END
BEGIN NOW Just utterly ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t  eed  o fucking king.  END
BEGIN NOW And I don’t need to pay tithe to the bastard either.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s my own money.  END
BEGIN NOW I earned it.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t do shit for me.  END
BEGIN NOW  Why should I give him ten percent? Or however much.  END
BEGIN NOW What has he ever done for me personally that warrents him a percentage of my income? You answer me that.  END
BEGIN NOW You tell me what he does that so fucking important.  END
BEGIN NOW I certainly don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve seen him do nothing but start wars and piss off other countries with less to lose by getting involved.  END
BEGIN NOW And there goes my money.  END
BEGIN NOW Buying bombs and paying for pilots to fly them.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes me sick, really it does.  END
BEGIN NOW I sicked up three times this morning just thinking about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t stand this  onsense.  END
BEGIN NOW This whole country is so backwards right now.  END
BEGIN NOW  And everyone gets so hopeful when an election comes around.  END
BEGIN NOW Like that’s ever going to change anything.  END
BEGIN NOW You let me know when the revolution comes around.  END
BEGIN NOW When we kill the oppressors and take our land back.  END
BEGIN NOW Take our jobs back.  END
BEGIN NOW Take back everything that the bastards took from us.  END
BEGIN NOW Our things.  END
BEGIN NOW Theft.  END
BEGIN NOW Government is a thieving bully.  END
BEGIN NOW  All around the world.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no such thing as a benevolent state.  END
BEGIN NOW Believe me on this.  END
BEGIN NOW Just trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been around the block.  END
BEGIN NOW I know what’s up.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m in the know.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter seventeen. END
BEGIN NOW Waking up in a park ain’t that bad, really.  END
BEGIN NOW You get the sound of traffic passing, birds in the trees.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone across the way squabbling over cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Morning dew on your face and a few new sore spots.  END
BEGIN NOW Just stretch and wake up.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all there is to do now.  END
BEGIN NOW Once that’s done, the list of things to do today is complete.  END
BEGIN NOW Relax.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about what you should be doing.  END
BEGIN NOW It is a perfect, overcast late fall morning.  END
BEGIN NOW The sky is a solid grey and only the round light of the sun breaks the homogeny.  END
BEGIN NOW  Students with their red eyes and heavy book bags march to class from the dorms and cloisters, the co-ops and close to campus apartment complexes.  END
BEGIN NOW The drop outs go to work and punch time cards in hopes of paychecks signed by bosses with very punchable faces.  END
BEGIN NOW The harder working of the bums begin getting up and gathering half broken guitars, odds and ends percussion sections, any old noise maker will do.  END
BEGIN NOW Something to attract attention.  END
BEGIN NOW Get some pockets alieviated from the overburden of loose change and stray dollars bills that would have only landed in the tip jar of some snotty barrista.  END
BEGIN NOW  Beecher was not one of harder working bums.  END
BEGIN NOW Work is not so much an activity that Beecher took part in.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s was more the observational type.  END
BEGIN NOW He was around and felt little to no need for action.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever came along did so and he was not one to assist or deter, just to accept and move on.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher took a liking to a bench.  END
BEGIN NOW He greeted the bench and sat down. END
BEGIN NOW In the park there are people setting up for a concert.  END
BEGIN NOW They move speakers and connect wires.  END
BEGIN NOW A man choreographs the movements of the sound equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW Men with tattoos and college guys that needed some weekend work.  END
BEGIN NOW A few others unfurl a banner and stretch it between two poles.  END
BEGIN NOW The banner reads, ‘Noodles and Jam - Music Festival and Spaghetti Feed’.  END
BEGIN NOW  Beecher eyes a young woman in a gypsy skirt, dancing before the music arrived.  END
BEGIN NOW  The citizens of the park seem to be behaving themselves in predictable ways.  END
BEGIN NOW A young man sits on Beecher’s bench and doesn’t say anything.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks out as if something important were happening just beyond the park.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks through it but not at it. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey kid.  END
BEGIN NOW You here for the music festival?” END
BEGIN NOW “And the spaghetti feed, I’m starving.  END
BEGIN NOW Got an extra cigarette? Smokies?” END
BEGIN NOW “Smokies? Jesus Christ, when will you kids leave me alone.  END
BEGIN NOW I ran out of rollies last night.” END
BEGIN NOW “Aw that’s a shame.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t had a cigarette in twenty minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I might lose my mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever been in love?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Here and there.  END
BEGIN NOW Happens to the worst of us.” END
BEGIN NOW The young man laughs in a perceptively forced manner.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks Beecher is trying to be funny, or witty, or just sarcastic.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher isn’t trying to be anything.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just half a bum.  END
BEGIN NOW The laughter comes in a series of short lyrical ‘ha’s, each one accented individually. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t think I’m going to fall in love again.  END
BEGIN NOW  I am continually disappointed with love.  END
BEGIN NOW Every girl I meet isn’t capable of real love.  END
BEGIN NOW They can never love me like I love them.  END
BEGIN NOW I am doomed to walk the earth, always alone and unloved.  END
BEGIN NOW Or at least, not loved to an acceptable degree.” The young man looks up at the sky, trying very hard to look deep in thought and stewing in memories of failed relationships. END
BEGIN NOW “You just need to get your dick wet.”  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher looks the young man over.  END
BEGIN NOW He has long orange hair and a stubborn collection of stubble on his face, pretending to be a beard in some places, method acting as a goatee in others.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing some kind of Asian bathrobe.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears it like a smoking jacket that ran out of cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW The features of his face are sharp and sad.  END
BEGIN NOW He opens his mouth again and emits the staccato laughter of washed up actors that once played arch villains on old TV shows use after three bottles of cheap wine while watching midnight reruns or their former glory. END
BEGIN NOW “No.  END
BEGIN NOW No I don’t think that’s it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just getting laid wouldn’t solve my problems.” END
BEGIN NOW “But you still want to get laid, right? You’re still a horny bastard and some sexin’ would do you good.”  END
BEGIN NOW “Maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW But sex without love just feels so empty to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t do it.  END
BEGIN NOW If I ever fall in love again, she’s going to have to be just as in love with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise, I don’t see the point.” END
BEGIN NOW “The fuck do you care about love? Why does that really matter? Can’t you just be cool with your shit and not need some fucking woman to validate your own personal value? I bet I know what your problem really is.  END
BEGIN NOW  I bet I know what really goes down.  END
BEGIN NOW You get all needy because you think you  eed someone else’s love when really, that’s nice and all, but you don’t need it.  END
BEGIN NOW You want it really bad, sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone wants to be loved more than they are.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s just human nature.  END
BEGIN NOW But we’re all selfish and self centered.  END
BEGIN NOW The best you can do is learn to love yourself and if other people love you to, then congrats.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re not doing so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, when you say you love someone more than they love you, you’re full of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just greedy for attention.  END
BEGIN NOW And you don’t really love them.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s fucking horseshit.  END
BEGIN NOW You just want to feel important and wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW You want to be desirable and necessary for whoever’s happiness.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s just your own selfishness coming back around to bite you in the ass.” END
BEGIN NOW The young man smiles at the sky condescendingly.  END
BEGIN NOW He smiles like a professor of English literature being forced to listen to kindergarten students reading aloud their accounts of summer vacation.  END
BEGIN NOW He says, “Maybe you’re right.” He says it in such a way that says, “You’re not right at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I alone know the details of my tragedy.  END
BEGIN NOW And I am doomed in my loneliness.  END
BEGIN NOW No one can help me, because my problem is beyond the understanding and capacity of most people.” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher spits on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’ve been around a while.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty much in the know about these things.” END
BEGIN NOW The exaggerated laughter comes out again.  END
BEGIN NOW It stumbles out like a wino out of a water closet.  END
BEGIN NOW The young man looks vacantly involved with nothing in particular.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well old man, you got a name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Of course I have a  ame.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a ridiculous fucking question.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s Beecher.  END
BEGIN NOW Just call me Beecher if you feel compelled to call me something other than old man.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.” He sits there in anticipation for a few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t you want to know my name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Not really.” Beecher coughs and makes an effort to get all the snot out of his throat, coughing and spitting up whatever he can get. END
BEGIN NOW “My name’s Parsley Thumbs Burnside.  END
BEGIN NOW Most people just call me Thumbs though.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a bit of a mouthful of a name.  END
BEGIN NOW My mother must have thought it was a cute name to garnish me with.  END
BEGIN NOW She must have thought my thumbs would lead me to greatness.  END
BEGIN NOW Today is the first day I’ve been outside in seven months.  END
BEGIN NOW My thumbs have lead me to level seven of Dragon Demon Temple Thief.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m only outside because the power went out.  END
BEGIN NOW I think someone forgot to pay the bill.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m don’t really care.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s nice to be outside, at a spaghetti feed with the common folk.” END
BEGIN NOW “You callin’ me common?” Beecher almost seems offended.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems like he’d much rather taste his own mucus and chew on his lips and cough up lung butter. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh not you.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m talking about the worker bees out there, with their silly jobs.  END
BEGIN NOW Earning wages and paying for parking and working power outlets.  END
BEGIN NOW What kind of life is that? Working.  END
BEGIN NOW Honestly, I just don’t understand some people.  END
BEGIN NOW Why go through all the trouble? There are other ways to get by than work.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s terribly tiring and such a hassle.  END
BEGIN NOW Not to mention the people you have to deal with.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re always so incompetent and bossy.  END
BEGIN NOW Worker bees are so boring.  END
BEGIN NOW Just clock in, clock out, go to bed, wake up, clock in.  END
BEGIN NOW At least someone is getting something done, I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW But really, not my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW What a waste of time.” END
BEGIN NOW “Did you really just accuse the stagehands of wasting their time when all you do is play fucking video games?” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s not all I do.  END
BEGIN NOW I have to sleep sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I sleep for days on end.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m so very tired all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Living is such a tiring business.” END
BEGIN NOW “Kid, you don’t know the meaning of living.  END
BEGIN NOW How old are you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty three.” END
BEGIN NOW “Figured it’d be something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Listen.  END
BEGIN NOW  Listen very carefully to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to give you the best advice anyone has ever given you.  END
BEGIN NOW You should go home and drop your television from a very high place.  END
BEGIN NOW You should watch it fall to the ground and shatter below.  END

BEGIN NOW You might be forced to do something with your mind.  END
BEGIN NOW You might find a way to deal with time in a creative manner.  END
BEGIN NOW All of this is hypothetical, or course.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d probably just sleep more and stare at the space where the television once was.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like the extent of your capabilities.” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, that was a little harsh.  END
BEGIN NOW I just met you and you already hate me, proving my original point of being unlovable.  END
BEGIN NOW  I am doomed.” Thumbs Burnside leans his head back with exaggerated effort.  END
BEGIN NOW He lets out a sigh that would make the virgin Mary roll her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW His sigh is a dozen rafts with punctured lungs lying on couches, telling a dozen therapists about how mother never seemed to have enough time to pay attention because she was working two jobs and looking for a new daddy.  END
BEGIN NOW “You’re a very depressing person.  END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever considered suicide as an answer? I mean, I’m sure you’ve thought about killing yourself a few times,” END
BEGIN NOW “A few times? Man, I think about suicide twice as often as I beat off.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sometimes I wear all black and walk in the middle of street at night in cautious optimism.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve listened to old radios in the bath tub.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve stored all the cleaning chemicals in easy to reach places.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve left knives lying around, just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, I figured that I’d just chain smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW The cancer will catch up to me at some point.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, but smoking is just a passive aggressive suicidal tendency.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a real half assed way of going about it.  END
BEGIN NOW If you really wanted to die, you’d be dead by now.  END
BEGIN NOW If you were serious in your efforts, it wouldn’t have taken more than five minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW You seem more like a bridge jumper to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve known a few bridge jumpers that were better men than you.  END
BEGIN NOW They had something to live for.  END
BEGIN NOW But you’re an enigma.  END
BEGIN NOW I just don’t understand why you bother to keep breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re taking up valuable resources from the rest of us.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, if I don’t do it, someone else will.  END
BEGIN NOW My existence is necessary.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a vital part of the human experience.  END
BEGIN NOW  I need to be around for a while.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why? You’re not vital at all.  END
BEGIN NOW No one needs you around.” END
BEGIN NOW “What about my mother? She still loves me.  END
BEGIN NOW She wants me around.” END
BEGIN NOW “I have my doubts.  END
BEGIN NOW When’s the last time you saw her?” END
BEGIN NOW “I talked to her last year on her birthday.  END
BEGIN NOW Gave her a phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW She sounded very concerned about me.  END

BEGIN NOW Two men drink from identical white mugs of coffee simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a knock at the door.  END
BEGIN NOW A silhouette stands behind the frosted glass. END
BEGIN NOW “Come in.” END
BEGIN NOW The door opens enough for a head to poke in, a woman in her early thirties with vibrant curly red hair, pulled back conservatively appears. END
BEGIN NOW “Chief wants to you two.  END
BEGIN NOW Pronto.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ah Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew this was coming.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, let’s not keep the old man waiting.” Two coffee mugs are set down in similar looking rings on a heavy oak desk. END
BEGIN NOW The walk to the chief’s office is through the bullpen of cubicles and general insanity that occupies a police station during the later afternoon of a major city.  END
BEGIN NOW Voices holler at each other from across the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Interns with stacks of paper scurry around from office to office.  END
BEGIN NOW Suspenders and white shirts with bland neckwear and loafers.  END
BEGIN NOW Office cops doing paper work.  END
BEGIN NOW The two men knock on another frosted glass door that bears the title ‘Chief’. END
BEGIN NOW “Sinclair! Templeton! Get your asses in here.” END
BEGIN NOW The two men enter and close the door behind them. END
BEGIN NOW “Have a seat, this might take a few minutes of your precious time.  END
BEGIN NOW I know your time is fucking precious because I see when you punch in and out of this place.  END
BEGIN NOW I know how much effort you put in your goddamn cases.  END
BEGIN NOW And why I keep you two on payroll is almost as mysterious as why this Canada thing is still in your hands.  END
BEGIN NOW We should have turned this over to the FBI months ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Months is a long fucking time to be working on the case.  END
BEGIN NOW Now let me run over what I have from your two idiots so far.  END
BEGIN NOW Around thirty missing bodies, stolen from morgues or graveyards or funeral homes.  END
BEGIN NOW Some five hundred pounds of dope recovered from trucks heading north to the boarder.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s this church burning thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t see how the missing bodies and the church burnings tie in.  END
BEGIN NOW That doesn’t make a lick of sense to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Why you fucking kids think there’s some connection, I have no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you’ve been pinching from the evidence locker.  END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn’t be surprised.  END
BEGIN NOW You mothers must have smoked a lot of that coke when you were germinating in their bellies.  END
BEGIN NOW So please.  END
BEGIN NOW Explain to me your fucking theory.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s see what the hell you knuckleheads have come up with.” END
BEGIN NOW The plain clothes man is named Pete Templeton.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been a detective in the Bay Area for some ten odd years.  END
BEGIN NOW The hat and jacket is named Addison Sinclair.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d be considered a rookie.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s Pete’s latest partner.  END
BEGIN NOW The last one ended up in therapy with a lawsuit against the whole department.  END
BEGIN NOW The affair was messy.  END
BEGIN NOW The paper work alone took the better part of a month.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete’s last partner ended up in the hospital with a broken leg and three bullets in his foot.  END
BEGIN NOW His account of the incident cleared Pete of man slaughter charges, but most of the department knew he started firing.  END
BEGIN NOW According to the official report a large man—Darnell Evan Jones III—was seen fleeing the scene of an attempted car theft.  END
BEGIN NOW The passenger window was shattered, shots were heard around the block.  END
BEGIN NOW Neighbors reported loud shouting.  END
BEGIN NOW The large man ran down a side street and was trying to hop a fence at the end.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete saw him climbing and opened fire.  END
BEGIN NOW Just warning shots over the top of the fence.  END
BEGIN NOW Something to scare the shit out of him and let him know that the police were here and that he was fucked.  END
BEGIN NOW The large man turned around, still clinging to the chain links and drew a pistol from his coat.  END
BEGIN NOW He fired half a clip in the general direction of the cops, thinking someone was trying to kill him.  END
BEGIN NOW Possible someone that just got out of a car with a broken window.  END
BEGIN NOW The most of the bullets hit nothing worth noting.  END
BEGIN NOW  A few hit the partner.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete figured he was out, or at least close to out of bullets and ran closer to get a better shot.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t notice his partner was on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t notice that the large man had back up—Micah Johnson-Gilas and Jorge Manual Rivas—with blunt instruments coming to meet him, closing everyone in the ally.  END
BEGIN NOW The partner was clubbed with a baseball bat.  END
BEGIN NOW They broke a rib and his leg.  END
BEGIN NOW When the bat came up the next time, the chest of the man holding was pumping hot lead and emitting a stream of crimson.  END
BEGIN NOW One down.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete turned and shot four bullets into the face of the large man on the fence.  END
BEGIN NOW His inner most thoughts landed on the concrete below and he dropped down to meet them.  END
BEGIN NOW The third assailant was shot once in the pelvis.  END
BEGIN NOW He dropped his weapon and fell to his knees.  END
BEGIN NOW The autopsy later revealed that his face had suffered a severe beating from a police issue pistol.  END
BEGIN NOW His  eck was broken and both hands had been crushed with the force of militant boots.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete’s old partner was named James Jonas Marshall and no one in the department talked about him when Pete was around. END
BEGIN NOW Addison knew most of this and never brought it up.  END
BEGIN NOW Addison was a good talker.  END
BEGIN NOW He was good brains.  END
BEGIN NOW He made a good sidekick, but he wasn’t as action oriented as Pete.  END
BEGIN NOW They complimented each other well in the field.  END
BEGIN NOW Addison started to explain. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, Chief.  END
BEGIN NOW The way we figure it is like this.  END
BEGIN NOW We traced incidents back to Chicago sometime last year.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t know exactly when everything started, but the Chicago papers gave enough clues to give us a ballpark figure.  END
BEGIN NOW The first church burning in the Chicago area occurred about seven months ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone suspected the building was just old and had bad wiring.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone left a lamp on that malfunctioned and started the blaze in the basement.  END
BEGIN NOW It looked like a freak accident.  END
BEGIN NOW A month later across town another church went down due to bad wiring.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, Chicago is known for some old churches and a few famous fires.  END
BEGIN NOW The papers covered the stories as if The Devil had manifested and started taking down the houses of god, one by one.  END
BEGIN NOW Believers thought the end times were here.  END
BEGIN NOW Hysteria was spreading.  END
BEGIN NOW People were getting scared.  END
BEGIN NOW The third building caught a blaze only two weeks later.  END
BEGIN NOW This time an outside outlet over burdened with Easter lights went nuts.  END
BEGIN NOW In all the cases the fire took everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Either reducing the parish to ashes, or leaving a blackened shell.  END
BEGIN NOW All the wood was old.  END
BEGIN NOW The paint was old.  END
BEGIN NOW Church goers set up message boards and began suspecting foul play.  END
BEGIN NOW They started thinking that they were being targeted but a malevolent force…” END
BEGIN NOW “Just a minute now, Sinclair.  END
BEGIN NOW You want me to believe that Satan is behind these acts of terrorism? Islamic fundamentalists?” END
BEGIN NOW “Let me finish.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just starting.” Addison clears his throat.  END
BEGIN NOW “Could we get some coffee?” He lights a cigarette and prepares the information in his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW “Soon after the third burning, the Chicago cops were looking for answers.  END
BEGIN NOW They too suspected something was up.  END
BEGIN NOW Three churches in two months was enough to rile anyone into suitable paranoia.  END
BEGIN NOW In each case there was nothing terribly out of the ordinary.  END
BEGIN NOW No calling card, no signs of group activity.  END
BEGIN NOW When a terrorist group commits an act, they tend to have a purpose or leave a message.  END
BEGIN NOW They want people to know there was a reason behind the destruction.  END
BEGIN NOW But, like I said, nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Just three old buildings up in flames with bad electricity.  END
BEGIN NOW  Now, about three weeks after the first church went down, one of the cops noticed that the cemetery had been tampered with.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the graves, the most recent addition, had loose dirt over it.  END
BEGIN NOW A little too loose for comfort.  END
BEGIN NOW He investigated and had the site exhumed.  END
BEGIN NOW  He found nothing, that is, there was no body.  END
BEGIN NOW The casket was there, but the corpse was missing.  END
BEGIN NOW He placed the time of retrieval around the day before the burning happened.  END
BEGIN NOW As we all know, a coincidence is never just a coincidence.  END
BEGIN NOW The officer conducting the investigation found a few more bodies were missing from a nearby morgue.  END
BEGIN NOW The bodies seemed to disappear a day or two before a church went up in smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW By the time he discovered this, another church went down, outside of his jurisdiction, a state away, in fact, along the old highway.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, his reports end about there.  END
BEGIN NOW He must have been called off the case and I don’t know what happened to it.  END
BEGIN NOW The churches of Chicago seemed to stabilize after that.  END
BEGIN NOW No more incidents have occurred since.  END
BEGIN NOW But along the old highway, the same pattern emerged.  END
BEGIN NOW Churches went down.  END
BEGIN NOW Always with electrical problems.  END
BEGIN NOW No sign, no trace of foul play.  END
BEGIN NOW Just some electricians mistake and a few stiffs no one could account for.  END
BEGIN NOW When the Texas panhandle got hit, the people went nuts.  END
BEGIN NOW They started flooding the churches and keeping vigils.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d stay in the church all night, and post watch.  END
BEGIN NOW But once again, as soon as they caught on, a few towns down the road it started all over again.  END
BEGIN NOW There was one incident where a body was actually taken from the casket an hour before the funeral was scheduled.  END
BEGIN NOW  People panicked and prayed.” END
BEGIN NOW “What about the dope? The churches and the bodies are one thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I can see what you’re getting at.  END
BEGIN NOW But still, no Canada, no dope.  END
BEGIN NOW Get to the fucking point already.”  END
BEGIN NOW A girl wearing a smart business skirt and blouse arrives with a tray of coffee mugs.  END
BEGIN NOW She sets the tray down and leaves the offices without saying a word to anyone. END
BEGIN NOW “Hold on, Chief.  END
BEGIN NOW This is where it starts to get a little strange.  END
BEGIN NOW  Now, we all know the Canadians are a bit more liberal about dope up there.  END
BEGIN NOW They treat it less like medicine or a drug then we do.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s really no  eed to be importing dope to Canada.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the traffic is in the opposite direction.  END
BEGIN NOW But right around the time the churches started to burn in Broom, Texas the first van of dope was stopped on the way north, just outside of Trinity County.  END
BEGIN NOW  The car had Canada plates and a Canadian driver.  END
BEGIN NOW He spoke only French and by the time they found a suitable translator, he had enough legal help to post bail.  END
BEGIN NOW All his identification papers were fakes.  END
BEGIN NOW The plates on the van didn’t match anything in the system.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was basically a ghost in a dead car.  END
BEGIN NOW No one has yet to track him down.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a side note in one of the Trinity police reports, not the official one, that lists a human body as part of the cargo.  END
BEGIN NOW  An autopsy revealed that the corpse died of cancer a week earlier, in Oklahoma City.  END
BEGIN NOW Before press, the official report lacked this detail, which is odd enough.  END
BEGIN NOW But the really strange thing is that no one in the Trinity police department can recall who made the report or any details concerning the incident.  END
BEGIN NOW Also the body showed no signs of decay or mummification.” END
BEGIN NOW The chief leans back in his chair which squeaks pungently.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the ceiling, mulling this new information over in his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW  “If what you’re saying is true… If all this information is related… Then we’re dealing with something big.  END
BEGIN NOW Really big.  END
BEGIN NOW Making this case would be big time for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Major funding for the department and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW This looks like an international incident.  END
BEGIN NOW Religious warfare, even.  END
BEGIN NOW I want you boys to keep me updated on everything you find out.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything.  END
BEGIN NOW And document every fucking detail.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want those cocksuckers in the FBI or the CIA to beat us on this one.  END
BEGIN NOW They interfere with us enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and whatever happened to that arrest made outside of Davenport? Did he gives us anything?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nothing much, really.  END
BEGIN NOW He admits that dealt with the Canadians, but seems rather ignorant of the details.  END
BEGIN NOW Probably just a routine dope deal for him.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way we have him with enough product for intent to sell and admission of guilt to selling across borders.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s rotting away in county still.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think he knows much else.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well then, we’ll let the little fucker stagnate for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Most we can do is give him a slap on the wrist then let him go.  END
BEGIN NOW But I want him followed.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to know what he eats and where he shits.  END
BEGIN NOW Full surveillance.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you record his phone call?” END
BEGIN NOW “Of course.  END
BEGIN NOW He only wanted to make one.  END
BEGIN NOW To his girlfriend.” END
BEGIN NOW “Isn’t that fucking sweet.  END
BEGIN NOW Do we know anything about her? Do you think she was in on it?” END
BEGIN NOW “When he made the call, he had to leave a message.  END
BEGIN NOW We called the phone company and she hasn’t paid her bill in over a month.  END
BEGIN NOW His message didn’t contain anything useful.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the usual, ‘Hey honey, I’m in jail for some bullshit, please save me’ kinda thing.  END
BEGIN NOW We ran background on her and started a file.  END
BEGIN NOW She hasn’t come home in two weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW We have a guy staking the place out, just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name is Laurel Jean Piedmont, age twenty four, one sister Marjorie, parents divorced.  END
BEGIN NOW One misdemeanor charge when she was eighteen for an open bottle and underage consumption.  END
BEGIN NOW Other than that, nothing much.  END
BEGIN NOW If she pops up, we’ll let you know.” END
BEGIN NOW “Good.  END
BEGIN NOW Alright, I’ve heard enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck off and let me get back to work.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and Templeton… If you so much as step out of line on this case… If I hear anything about bullets or brutality or anything.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s your ass.  END
BEGIN NOW You came too close to bringing us down before.  END
BEGIN NOW If you fuck this up, so help me god.  END
BEGIN NOW It won’t just be your badge.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a walking disaster, Templeton.  END
BEGIN NOW  I trust you’ve learned from your mistakes.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t trust a goddamn thing.” Pete says. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter nineteen. END
BEGIN NOW The messages on Laurel’s phone were as follows: END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Laurel… It’s me.  END
BEGIN NOW Umm… It looks like I’m in jail or something.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know if they’re going to let me go.  END
BEGIN NOW They never specified the charges.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like the ATF or DEA came after me.  END
BEGIN NOW They won’t let me talk to a lawyer and I think this is my only phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW It was either you or mom.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that should mean something.  END
BEGIN NOW But hey, look.  END
BEGIN NOW If you could come down here and try to visit, maybe we could work something out.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, this is still America.  END
BEGIN NOW  I still have rights, right? They can’t hold on to me forever for no discernable reason.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I guess there was a lot of weed in the house, or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW But that shouldn’t be such a big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW These guys are real assholes.  END
BEGIN NOW Also there’s this crazy motherfucker in my cell.  END
BEGIN NOW He keeps trying to talk politics at me.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s really starting to piss me off.  END
BEGIN NOW Also it’s really boring here.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost nothing to do.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t been stoned in days.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m losing my mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Please come get me.  END
BEGIN NOW I  eed you.  END
BEGIN NOW I… I love you.  END
BEGIN NOW Bye.” Beep. END
BEGIN NOW “Lars! It’s Marji.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell did you feed Dutch? He’s been shitting white foam and puking up black tar for the last two days.  END
BEGIN NOW I swear to shit, I hope it wasn’t that block of cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW  That thing has been in the fridge since I moved in.  END
BEGIN NOW If you kill my dog, I will find you.  END
BEGIN NOW I will track you down and dump all the vom and shit in a bag and put the bag over your head.  END
BEGIN NOW I will then proceed to beat you upside the head and spin you around in the shitty puke bag until you start puking and shitting on yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW I will beat you until you shit blood.  END
BEGIN NOW Ps.  END
BEGIN NOW Call me, I miss you.  END
BEGIN NOW And how’s Berk-town? Lots of love.” Beep. END
BEGIN NOW “Goddamnit Laurel, I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for three days now.  END
BEGIN NOW And I swear to Christ if you ate a bunch of those goddamn brownies and haven’t been able to get off the couch for a week like that one time last year, you’re fired.  END
BEGIN NOW  I mean it this time.  END
BEGIN NOW We all love you very much, but I simply can’t afford to keep you on payroll if you pull this shit.  END
BEGIN NOW We need you out here.  END
BEGIN NOW The turnips are a bumper crop this year and we need a few more hands to help out.  END
BEGIN NOW Also the market wouldn’t be the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, this is Nancy.  END
BEGIN NOW Again.  END
BEGIN NOW Call me.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s Nancy.  END
BEGIN NOW From work.” Beep. END
BEGIN NOW Well, at least everyone loves me.  END
BEGIN NOW I sat and stared at the phone, wondering who, if anyone I should call, for the better part of an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW I stared and stared but the answer never came.  END
BEGIN NOW I was sitting on the steps of the campus, contemplating my next move.  END
BEGIN NOW Where to go from here? The Mess and Shambles might know someone or something.  END
BEGIN NOW They seem to have a few connections.  END
BEGIN NOW I think.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, we have sold a good amount of weed during the last week, right? We did sell that weed… Right?  Jesus.  END
BEGIN NOW The spot where I’m sitting offers the view of a fountain.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a large building with unimpressive architecture to my left and an archway on the right.  END
BEGIN NOW The students pass underneath, coming and going with all their baggage.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them stop and talk.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them have set up booths for various interest groups.  END
BEGIN NOW Students for a Better World, Berkeley Republicans Club,  Jazz Appreciation Society, Jogging Our Way To Freedom and so on.  END
BEGIN NOW They really are very pretty, the students.  END
BEGIN NOW So full of youth and information and passion about the world around them or the world in their heads.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what that must be like.  END
BEGIN NOW  To be a student at Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what they must think about all day and what keeps them up at night.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder how many of them spend all day thinking about after this as opposed to say, living in the here and now and thinking about getting by until tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Even then, that’s not really here and now.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW And tomorrow can wait.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now there’s a beautiful campus full of old, rich looking buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s so many lovely trees and paths to walk.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I’m going to take one now. END
BEGIN NOW I head under the gate and continue straight on until the clock tower.  END
BEGIN NOW The Shambles said this was the tallest clock tower in, either northern California, or The Northwest.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a pretty fucking tall clock tower.  END
BEGIN NOW The sounds resounding from the tower are deep and appealing.  END
BEGIN NOW  It has the charm of old world Europe.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I’ve never been there, but from pictures and a few travelogues, from documentaries and movies n’ stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that’s what old world Europe is supposed to look like.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s also symbolic of a giant, majestic penis.  END
BEGIN NOW  And if Berkeley has the tallest tower, Berkeley is going to get all the chicks.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the logic behind the architecture. END
BEGIN NOW I make a right and walk up a path of notable steepness.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not so much a strain on the legs as it is a definite incline.  END
BEGIN NOW I know I’m walking uphill.  END
BEGIN NOW I walk up and weave between classrooms and libraries.  END
BEGIN NOW All the buildings are named after someone only the tour guides still care about.  END
BEGIN NOW On the tour they will tell you a short anecdote about their life and kinds of special things they did for the school.  END
BEGIN NOW The tour guide only cares about this during the tour.  END
BEGIN NOW For the most part, they’re just buildings and the names help us identify them and  avigate between them.  END
BEGIN NOW After a while there’s another fountain on my right.  END
BEGIN NOW Impulsively, I walk towards it and am hit by the sudden need to pee.  END
BEGIN NOW I take another right, since I’m on a roll, ending up in some kind of art building.  END
BEGIN NOW I check the map on the wall and look for a restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW  I have to make an L either way no matter which hall way I choose.  END
BEGIN NOW The restrooms are equidistant from the doors.  END
BEGIN NOW Who designs these layouts? Don’t they ever think about how many students a day are going to need to use a restroom and turn into the closest building hopes of finding relief and discovering nothing but a long, restrained walk to the opposite end.  END
BEGIN NOW Wouldn’t it make more sense to design buildings where people work and learn with restrooms right by the doors? END
BEGIN NOW I walk to the opposite end of the building and find the room with the pictogram of a woman because she’s wearing a skirt in a blue circle.  END
BEGIN NOW That symbol means I’m saved.  END
BEGIN NOW I rejoice and enter a stall, pulling down my pants without ceremony but with speed and accuracy.  END
BEGIN NOW  I take a seat and everything makes sense for a few seconds.  END
BEGIN NOW The tint of the lights becomes a little whiter.  END
BEGIN NOW My whole body feels like it has taken a breath of fresh air.  END
BEGIN NOW I notice the door of the stall is decorated with familiar markings.  END
BEGIN NOW The  ever mistakable scrawl of permanent pens in a restroom.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lot of the usual graffiti here.  END
BEGIN NOW  ‘Felicity is a whore’.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘Gary Shuin has hepatitis’.  END
BEGIN NOW  Various names and dates signed.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘I shat here for five hours.  END
BEGIN NOW It was amazing.  END
BEGIN NOW – Emily A.  END
BEGIN NOW Fall ’01’.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘Best sex I ever had was right where you’re shitting now.  END
BEGIN NOW –Valerie P.  END
BEGIN NOW ps fuck Stanford!!!’.  END
BEGIN NOW On the right wall there’s a full conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW Each line is in a different person’s handwriting and various colors of ink were used.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a question at the top, in dark purple.  END
BEGIN NOW ‘What do you think you’re doing here?’ below it seemed that several people would answer the question and several people would reply to everyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW The same ink and handwriting that started this reoccurred haphazardly.  END
BEGIN NOW As if there was a frequented stall of hers.  END
BEGIN NOW A place that she liked to hang out at.  END
BEGIN NOW She would ask more questions like, ‘What are you goals and ambitions?’ ‘In the near future it will be possible to travel back in time, at will, to fix our mistakes.  END
BEGIN NOW However we would only be able to accomplish this by eating a type of berry that contained a type of chemical that made you horrendously fat over a fairly short amount of time.  END
BEGIN NOW The weight would follow you no matter how far back you went.  END
BEGIN NOW For a roundtrip ticket to the past and back, you’d gain twenty pounds.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you use the berries, seldom, often or never?’.  END
BEGIN NOW  The responses took up a good two square feet of space.  END
BEGIN NOW  Was this constructive graffiti? A real, live message board.  END
BEGIN NOW Off line and in a restroom stall.  END
BEGIN NOW What a strange and sort of beautiful idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Totally anonymous if someone wants to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Just doing a little creative vandalism.  END
BEGIN NOW School property and all.  END
BEGIN NOW  But oh well.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a nice break from the gossip and crass humor I’m accustomed to in these settings.  END
BEGIN NOW I wipe off and walk out with my pants up and my hands washed and face cleaned and hair straightened.  END
BEGIN NOW Back down the long hall and towards the doors, reversing my L and hearing a strange noise coming from the stairwell.  END
BEGIN NOW  Upon closer inspection the stairwell has some wicked acoustics.  END
BEGIN NOW The echo in here is perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW The reverberation is amazing.  END
BEGIN NOW A musician has taken advantage of the sound quality.  END
BEGIN NOW He stands at the base of the stairs walking in circles.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s blowing himself blue on a harmonica.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands move across his face like a man eating corn off the cob in a competition.  END
BEGIN NOW He wails and bends and toots his way along, sounding something like a train under the influence of whiskey and wine and women.  END
BEGIN NOW  He mutters and sputters and makes a song out of a few notes that he found lying around.  END
BEGIN NOW He weaves something like a narrative from stray bits of sonic vibrations he chances upon.  END
BEGIN NOW The air of the song is haphazard, obeying no structure and following no cohesive pattern.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead he seems to switch between various patterns.  END
BEGIN NOW Repeating some often and bring an old one back for a one shot run through.  END
BEGIN NOW He spins and whirls and creates a dizzy drunken rambling off track never ending harmonica solo.  END
BEGIN NOW He has to run out of breath sometime.  END
BEGIN NOW He can’t hang on to this forever.  END
BEGIN NOW  I can’t wait long enough.  END
BEGIN NOW I should get going.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside the air is crisp and cool.  END
BEGIN NOW The darkness swings around early and everyone is still going or coming.  END
BEGIN NOW Entering or leaving.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither where they want to be or where they came from.  END
BEGIN NOW  I check my phone for the time and it’s just after five in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW  Might as well start walking back.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop by the market again.  END
BEGIN NOW  Get back to the boys and their odd monastery.  END
BEGIN NOW Cook some dinner.  END
BEGIN NOW Drink a few beers, smoke a few bowls.  END
BEGIN NOW Relax and figure out a game plan.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like a good idea.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a pretty agreeable way of going about this business.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I feel like asking the guys what they’d do.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s probably what they’d say.  END
BEGIN NOW Just relax.  END
BEGIN NOW Something will come along.  END
BEGIN NOW How typically lazy of them.  END
BEGIN NOW No effort required.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess it is a kind of Zen thing, really.  END
BEGIN NOW  Action through not acting.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW The Mess was mumbling about it the other night.  END
BEGIN NOW Woo something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW  It sounded very much like a lazy kind of philosophy. END
BEGIN NOW I make my way back down Telegraph.  END
BEGIN NOW Past a few head shops, a few tattoo parlours.  END
BEGIN NOW A few vintage clothing stores and more than enough markets.  END
BEGIN NOW I walk Telegraph to Dwight.  END
BEGIN NOW  Dwight to Shattuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Shattuck to Derby and there’s the farmer’s market.  END
BEGIN NOW I weave my way down to the booth I usually work at and find Tia. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey T.” I wave at her. END
BEGIN NOW “Laurel! Jesus Christ, where have you been? We’ve been looking and calling and wondering what the hell have you been.  END
BEGIN NOW I was worried fucking sick.  END
BEGIN NOW My god.  END
BEGIN NOW If you only knew the kind of stress I’ve gone through over you’re little disappearing act… So anyway, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Nancy told me about what happened.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry to hear that.  END
BEGIN NOW When are you coming back to work?” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know yet.  END
BEGIN NOW This might take a few more days.  END
BEGIN NOW I just got the message from Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW He said they won’t let him talk to a lawyer and I was his only phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really think it’s safe to go into Davenport just yet.” END
BEGIN NOW “Why’s that? Your boy’s sitting around in county, how is that your problem? Did you two do something stupid?” END
BEGIN NOW “No! Well, nothing that stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW We had a lot of plants on our property, but who doesn’t up there?  We both have medical cards.  END
BEGIN NOW It shouldn’t have been a big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW But the most they could do in that case would be to confiscate the plants and give Roscoe a slap on the wrist.  END
BEGIN NOW He should be out by now.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know, T.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll call you or Joe or someone as soon as I know anything for sure.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, shit dude.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’ll have to do for now.  END
BEGIN NOW You hungry? We have these cranberry beans.  END
BEGIN NOW We have lots of cranberry beans.  END
BEGIN NOW You should take some home with you.  END
BEGIN NOW You should take some cranberry beans home.  END
BEGIN NOW Or where ever you’re staying.  END
BEGIN NOW Where are you staying, by the way?” END
BEGIN NOW “Uh, some friends of my sister.  END
BEGIN NOW I think.” END
BEGIN NOW “Right.  END
BEGIN NOW Ok.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s cool or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW So, beans? Yes? No?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure, I’ll take a few pounds.  END
BEGIN NOW Fresh beans would do good.  END
BEGIN NOW What else you got?” END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s see, we got the usual herbs.  END
BEGIN NOW Some last of season dry farm tomatoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Romano beans, haricot vert, some chicories.  END
BEGIN NOW  Take your pick, you know the stock by heart.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, alright.” END
BEGIN NOW After hitting up a few other booths, I had the makings of a good meal for three people.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight would be a nice meal and lots of beer and weed and we could go from there.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds wonderful.  END
BEGIN NOW I turn onto Martin Luther King Jr.  END
BEGIN NOW Way until I see Russell and walk down to Sacramento.  END
BEGIN NOW The guys are in the middle of a jam session.  END
BEGIN NOW The Mess plays a guitar while the Shambles plucks at an instrument of his own design.  END
BEGIN NOW He bends a hinge to adjust the tension on the strings.  END
BEGIN NOW He plucks at it with a chunk of plastic and metal picks on his three smaller fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW No one looks up as I enter the room.  END
BEGIN NOW Deep in the jam and unwilling to break concentration for anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I ask if anyone is hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW  Instead of words I get notes.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead of replies I see heads nodding.  END
BEGIN NOW  That’s enough of an answer for me.  END
BEGIN NOW I start shucking the beans hear a knock at the door.  END
BEGIN NOW The boys do nothing about it so I open it.  END
BEGIN NOW In front of the door is the man that nature forgot to kill.  END
BEGIN NOW He stares back at me as I look on at him in shock and horror.  END
BEGIN NOW The dehydrated husk of a man that used to be a boy that said, ‘why not?’.  END
BEGIN NOW  A black and white cat looks at a mouse and starts saying hello until the projector snags and the tape slows down and a door slams in the cats face in the middle of saying, “Heeey” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twenty. END
BEGIN NOW In the sprawl, in the middle of a section of suburbia, there’s a church and preacher that live across from each other.  END
BEGIN NOW They have a mutual relationship of a fairly parasitic nature.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been Alcoholics Anonymous night.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a Wednesday.  END
BEGIN NOW In the den of Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael’s home he sits in his chair with a copy of the collected works of Arthur Conan Doyle.  END
BEGIN NOW He reads by the light from a lamp and drinks from a glass of scotch and ice.  END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend has had five scotches since the meeting adjourned.  END
BEGIN NOW He read through a pair of bifocal reading glasses and drank from his scotch.  END
BEGIN NOW In the story, Sherlock Holmes plays the violin and imbibes cocaine.  END
BEGIN NOW He hears a ghastly story and very patiently displays everyone’s ignorance at the obvious connections in a chain of events and unmasks the perpetrators.  END
BEGIN NOW Always with so much class.  END
BEGIN NOW Doyle could write a satisfactory mystery story.  END
BEGIN NOW The Reverend sat in his chair thinking about pulling out his pipe in order to complete his surroundings.  END
BEGIN NOW The ice and scotch mingled together, alleviating the aromas and letting them wander the airways into Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael’s nostrils, sending a signal to his synapses to fire in his brain, and recalling another time he had drank this brand and vintage of scotch.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was a young man at the time, first getting a taste for that particular poison.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was living alone and in a major city for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW Fresh out of college and thinking himself to be a man now, for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW He was an adult.  END
BEGIN NOW He had grown up.  END
BEGIN NOW To celebrate his maturity, he went out and purchased a fifth of expensive scotch.  END
BEGIN NOW He stayed up until dawn, drinking alone in his apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW When the sun started to come up, when the earth took on an orange hue, he threw the bottle out of his fifth story window.  END
BEGIN NOW He listened to the sound of the glass shattering on the concrete below and fell asleep, on the floor by the window.  END
BEGIN NOW A dog barks somewhere in the sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW A dog is always barking somewhere in the sprawl.  END
BEGIN NOW  Just like the sound of sirens is  ever a long ways away.  END
BEGIN NOW Always something going on.  END
BEGIN NOW  The words on the pages of the book begin to blur and change positions.  END
BEGIN NOW The preacher man has reread the last paragraph in various degrees eleven times over the last few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW He adjusts his reading glasses and walks into the kitchen for more scotch.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks over in the liquor cabinet in a pair of well worn slippers, taking a bottle from inside and unscrewing the lid.  END
BEGIN NOW He pours the scotch into the glass, letting the amber liquid settle half way up.  END
BEGIN NOW He motions to the freezer and extracts three ice cubes.  END
BEGIN NOW The cubes crack on contact.  END
BEGIN NOW Shattering a line split in several directions simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW The reverend walks back to his study to fetch his pipe.  END
BEGIN NOW And to pray that the tobacco isn’t all that stale.  END
BEGIN NOW Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael has been leading the A.A.  END
BEGIN NOW meetings for the last four months.  END
BEGIN NOW He figured it would be a good idea for his community.  END
BEGIN NOW There were more liquor stores per block in the  eighborhoods around the church than there were bus stops.  END
BEGIN NOW Tramps and bums could be seen walking around, pushing stolen shopping carts packed with recyclables.  END
BEGIN NOW Hoping for enough empty cans to purchase a full one.  END
BEGIN NOW Kind of like buy fifty get one free.  END
BEGIN NOW The drinking problem became more apparent after the accident.  END
BEGIN NOW A drunk driver involved in family deaths will become a life long obsession with alcohol.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s prevention and cure and cause and effect.  END
BEGIN NOW  After the accident is also when the scotch and the rum came back into the reverend’s life. END
BEGIN NOW After marriage, the reverend broke up with the bottle and remained sober.  END
BEGIN NOW He married a nice small town girl and had two predictable children.  END
BEGIN NOW They were rebellious in their own small way, but they were preacher’s kids.  END
BEGIN NOW Rebellion comes naturally.  END
BEGIN NOW  It should be expected.  END
BEGIN NOW  Kids are always going to rebel until they start imitating.  END
BEGIN NOW When they are older, and if their parents are honest enough with them, they will see themselves replicating the decisions of their parents, reconfigured for the present day.  END
BEGIN NOW This may provoke change in the behavior of the child, but it will also reinforce the logic behind it.  END
BEGIN NOW Learning the history of the parent will justify the same decisions in the child.  END
BEGIN NOW If it worked for them or didn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW But the reverend’s kids were by no means bad.  END
BEGIN NOW They just did fairly normal things.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the boy got into a fight at school.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe the girl went on a date and came home past curfew.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing terrible.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t have prison records. END
BEGIN NOW The wife was typical for preachers.  END
BEGIN NOW That is, she was always looking for something to occupy her time.  END
BEGIN NOW She went to community meetings and always had a lot to say.  END
BEGIN NOW If her husband could do it, so could she.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t hold a job, exactly, but she was always busy with something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW She was not what you would call beautiful at first glance.  END
BEGIN NOW She was not exactly plain, either.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a woman and carried herself as a woman without her appearance being questioned or her character coming under scrutiny.  END
BEGIN NOW She was the preacher’s wife and she had integrity.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael had a reputation in the parent teachers association, mother’s against drunk drivers, and the Red Hat Society. END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend has spilled his drink.  END
BEGIN NOW The glass lands on the floor and does not break.  END
BEGIN NOW The ice and the scotch blend into the carpet, soaking up and spreading a spot a few inches in diameter.  END
BEGIN NOW  His hands are lax and lazy.  END
BEGIN NOW The drink has calmed him a litter farther than he expected.  END
BEGIN NOW He slumps in his chair and feels his head going numb.  END
BEGIN NOW The muscles in his eyes are feeling strained and heavy.  END
BEGIN NOW He rouses from his chair and stumbles into the bathroom.  END
BEGIN NOW He unzips his pants and lifts up the toilet seat lid.  END
BEGIN NOW He opens the window above and sees an orange glow on the neighbors house.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks to himself, ‘the sun set hours ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Is it rising already? How long have I been reading? Good lord.’ END
BEGIN NOW The preacher takes his empty glass into the kitchen and doesn’t bother to turn off the light.  END
BEGIN NOW He can see clearly in the glow coming from across the street.  END
BEGIN NOW He stares up, mouth open, looking out the windows at his church.  END
BEGIN NOW The flames climb towards heaven.  END
BEGIN NOW The smoke is light and gray against the  ight sky.  END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend drops his glass on the tile floor and watches his parish burn with fire. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twenty One: END
BEGIN NOW He pulled in for gas in Ukiah.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a pit stop kind of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Not really the type of place that wants the passers though to linger too long.  END
BEGIN NOW We have enough people.  END
BEGIN NOW Thank you very much for stopping at our gas stations and motels, but really, you should get going.  END
BEGIN NOW Earlier you start the faster you’ll get where you’re going.  END
BEGIN NOW Ukiah has no need for more additions to the population number on the city limits sign.  END
BEGIN NOW The census doesn’t need to take any longer than necessary.  END
BEGIN NOW  Spence fills the tank and walks into the small store that sells items passing for food in plastic wrappers, an assortment of beverages and cigarettes behind the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW The tank is full and he could use some liquid refreshment.  END
BEGIN NOW  He settles on a twelve pack of cheap beer and a few random energy drinks with goofy names and promises well beyond the scope of an over the counter concoction. END
BEGIN NOW Back in the van now empty of bodies.  END
BEGIN NOW Now with a fat wallet and no need to work for a while, Spencer is due for a short vacation.  END
BEGIN NOW  If only because the work isn’t terrible difficult.  END
BEGIN NOW If only because he’s sure to be able to get one or two more between here and Los Angeles.  END
BEGIN NOW If he feels like it.  END
BEGIN NOW If he is so inclined.  END
BEGIN NOW The thought makes Spencer supremely content about his current line of work.  END
BEGIN NOW Work when and where I  eed to, pay is beyond compare.  END
BEGIN NOW Boss is a bit of a freak but that’s not a problem when he only comes around when the call is made.  END
BEGIN NOW And shit man, he pays well.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer leans on his van and lights a cigarette, watching the numbers climb at the pump.  END
BEGIN NOW  An old woman stares at him, flicking ashes and playing with fire by the fueling station.  END
BEGIN NOW She is aghast.  END
BEGIN NOW She is certainly quite frightened.  END
BEGIN NOW You could say that she was beyond her wits.  END
BEGIN NOW Out of her mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Crazy with disbelief at what her eyes told her brain was happening not so far from where she sat in her Cadillac.  END
BEGIN NOW  She starts yelling at Spencer but he window is up.  END
BEGIN NOW Her lips move behind the glass.  END
BEGIN NOW  Mouthing words such as, “You stupid bastard! You’re going to kill us all.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t you know you’re at a gas station young man?  Gas station! Fire! You complete idiot.  END
BEGIN NOW How dare you endanger my life and the lives of everyone around us?  How careless! How ridiculous you are!  Why I ought to have to arrested! You should be locked up.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s people like you that make it unsafe to walk the streets at night.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s people like you that make the rest of us hole up in our homes in fear.  END
BEGIN NOW You should be ashamed of yourself, young man!” END
BEGIN NOW Spencer can’t hear any of this.  END
BEGIN NOW His radio is playing loudly and he’s watching some crazy old cunt jabber away, looking at him through her window.  END
BEGIN NOW  He smiles his best fuck you and flicks the butt right at her.  END
BEGIN NOW She jumps back inside her chair, hitting her head on the passenger seat.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to avoid the cigarette that has to penetrate glass in order to burn her.  END
BEGIN NOW  She doesn’t know that a cigarette will not ignite gasoline fumes unless air is passing rapidly over the cherry.  END
BEGIN NOW A cigarette without a mouth sucking in smoke behind it is simply not hot enough to start a gasoline fire.  END
BEGIN NOW Even the minute increase in temperature from the air flow of a falling cigarette is not enough.  END
BEGIN NOW And the spark has to catch the fumes,  ot the liquid.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer understand all of this and that’s why he likes to smoke at gas stations.  END
BEGIN NOW Because most people panic and think he’s insane.  END
BEGIN NOW He just has a better understanding of what is and is not actually safe.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not dead yet.  END
BEGIN NOW And he’s made a hobby out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Spencer turns the volume up higher and sings along loudly to Sweet Home Alabama, pulling out of the gas station and leaving Ukiah behind him for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Until the next time he wants to go north.  END
BEGIN NOW  Until the next time he feels like taking his job on the road.  END
BEGIN NOW The next time he feels like swimming in an Oregon river and reading the papers for a few more cancer victims.  END
BEGIN NOW He remembers a conversation with Ross about the nature of the work.  END
BEGIN NOW About what, exactly he was getting involved in.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer tried to listen to everything Ross said, but a lot of it seemed pretty far out.  END
BEGIN NOW Ross said that the bodies of the victims were necessary for the study of how cancer spreads and what causes, stimulates and deters the growths.  END
BEGIN NOW  Then there was a breakthrough sometime last year.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes last year Ross wanted Spence to get him as many bodies as he could within a week.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a back breaker.  END
BEGIN NOW So many corpses, so much time and digging and sneaking around the funeral homes.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t an easy job.  END
BEGIN NOW But the amount of time required of him to achieve the financial gains made everything worth the trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW  That week, Spencer earned enough to make the trip west.  END
BEGIN NOW He earned his way to California and made a few grand more on the way.  END
BEGIN NOW Ross said his efforts had earned him a place in history.  END
BEGIN NOW Ross said his contributions to society would never be forgotten.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that Spencer considered saving the lives of cancer patients little more than a hobby.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that Spence would achieve immortality for his other interests.  END
BEGIN NOW The road from here on out was mostly dry grass and hills in the distance.  END
BEGIN NOW Rolling hills with little to offer.  END
BEGIN NOW The road was flat and contained very little in the way of curvature.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer thanks god he stopped at the taco truck before hitting the freeway.  END
BEGIN NOW When Spencer thanks god, he does so verbally.  END
BEGIN NOW He puts no mind into his thanks.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t think about a god he’s actually thanking for the taco truck being on his route to the on ramp.  END
BEGIN NOW The presence of the taco truck has little if anything to do with any god he’s ever heard of.  END
BEGIN NOW If there were a god of taco trucks, Spence might start paying attention to the idea of god in a slightly more serious manner.  END
BEGIN NOW The concept of god wouldn’t seem nearly as abstract.  END
BEGIN NOW The concept of god might be something a bit more palatable.  END
BEGIN NOW  Something he could swallow.  END
BEGIN NOW Half a burrito resting on in the passenger seat Spencer passes the time in between cities singing along to the radio and smoking or drinking just enough to keep on driving.  END
BEGIN NOW Being alone in a car can be a harrowing experience.  END
BEGIN NOW Driving around the country in a nearly empty van could be disastrously dull.  END
BEGIN NOW The goal is to pay attention.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea is to stay alert and get from a to b without running into anything.  END
BEGIN NOW The goal is a safe trip.  END
BEGIN NOW With no arrests, no tickets, no injuries.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now the only place he wants to get to is Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW In Berkeley he can rest for a few days and put his feet up.  END
BEGIN NOW In Berkeley he can find some sanctuary before the long drive down to Los Angeles.  END
BEGIN NOW Highway 101 offers little in the way of distractions.  END
BEGIN NOW The highway ambles along in two to four to six lanes.  END
BEGIN NOW Fluctuating in width but always the same length.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer drives with a foot on the gas and something to occupy his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW A cigarette, some food, a beverage, a song.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to give him something to do besides stare ahead of him.  END
BEGIN NOW He listens to talk radio and wonders where these people come from.  END
BEGIN NOW An expression applying equally to the hosts as well as the callers.  END
BEGIN NOW Who actually calls into these shows to talk to some asshole that invariably cuts them off in order to assert their own opinion with more vigor and less rhetoric than before.  END
BEGIN NOW Where do these people come from? Who said this was ok? Who pays for this kind of crap?  The village was running out of idiots.  END
BEGIN NOW They all got jobs in talk radio. END
BEGIN NOW Every few miles there would be another gas station town.  END
BEGIN NOW The town, it’s self wasn’t anything exciting.  END
BEGIN NOW There were no attractions or reasons to stop there besides rest and fuel and food.  END
BEGIN NOW In between towns.  END
BEGIN NOW Never destinations.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence had to wonder about the people that lived in these towns.  END
BEGIN NOW How do you end up here? What would make anyone want to settle down in a place like this? What kind of life is that? Imagine if you ran a diner in a truck stop kind of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Your clientele would all be familiar and foreign.  END
BEGIN NOW Total strangers just like the last ones.  END
BEGIN NOW All the same breed from your perspective.  END
BEGIN NOW Would this be like living in a small town with amnesia, or playing a part on a TV show where every episode featured a  ew cast, but had the same plot and dialogue? END
BEGIN NOW Spencer looked in front of him and drove along to college radio stations when he could, classic rock when it seemed like a good idea, or just any kind of noise that wasn’t his own, in order to feel like he wasn’t the only source of noise and life in the van.  END
BEGIN NOW The lack of a corpse to talk to made him feel a little silly when he caught himself holding a one sided conversation.  END
BEGIN NOW  Empty body bags make shitty company.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer turned the radio dial to National Public Radio.  END
BEGIN NOW A little  ews would do him some good. END
BEGIN NOW A plot was uncovered for an attempt at assassination on the president’s life.  END
BEGIN NOW A village no one ever went to visit was at war with a neighboring village for reasons no one will ever understand enough to the point of being able to prevent.  END
BEGIN NOW The economy was falling rapidly.  END
BEGIN NOW The world at large seemed to spiral out of control.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s the news for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Truth is, not that much has really changed.  END
BEGIN NOW There are no end times rapidly approaching.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything changes in order to stay the same.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty sure that’s a quote.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty sure someone said that before, but I can’t remember who and I honestly don’t have the kind of time to look that up right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Point is, that’s not an original thought.  END
BEGIN NOW Point being, neither is anything else. END
BEGIN NOW The book of Revelations was written by a man that was high on psychedelic mushrooms.  END
BEGIN NOW This is  ot entirely his fault.  END
BEGIN NOW He was exiled to an island where they were a  atural foodstuff.  END
BEGIN NOW Naturally he consumed a great many and took to writing a book that seemed fantastic a thousand or so years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW Nowadays we would have simpley thrown the bastard in jail with the other lunatics that spouted impossible jargon or unbelievable stories.  END
BEGIN NOW In those days they made people like that doctors or shamans or prophets.  END
BEGIN NOW They believed there was something worth noting that they had to say.  END
BEGIN NOW Now we take it for the ramblings of a drug induced hysteria.  END
BEGIN NOW The same people that decided this was a drug induced hysteria are the same people that believe every word in the book of Revelations.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer checks his speedometer and it only wavers slightly.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been maintaining speed for some time.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting until Santa Rosa and one last pit stop before the bay area.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s waiting to see the sign that welcomes him back to the north end of one of the largest urban areas in the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW Once he hits Santa Rosa, he’ll have about an hour before he arrives in Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW  And when he arrives in Berkeley he needs to be sure to find Bitchnuts. END
BEGIN NOW Bitchnuts is one of those people you only stumble upon if you really want to.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not your normal , average guy.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a different set of ambitions in life.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a different code of conduct, separate system of value, and an altogether not so average outlook on what he expects of other people.  END
BEGIN NOW Finding Bitchnuts is a matter of combing the hangout spots.  END
BEGIN NOW To say that Bitchnuts is waiting for you implies that you have something of great value.  END
BEGIN NOW Bitchnuts doesn’t just give out his number.  END
BEGIN NOW His number has to be earned.  END
BEGIN NOW That could take years.  END
BEGIN NOW Spence doesn’t have his number yet.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s on the waiting list.  END
BEGIN NOW Be he knows where to look.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a collection of bars or cafes he’s been known to frequent.  END
BEGIN NOW There are various street corners where his presence is equally admired and feared.  END
BEGIN NOW If he can’t be found in body, then word of him will certainly circulate at The Infoshop—a kind of anarchist community center. END
BEGIN NOW Bitchnuts is what you might call a capitalist anarchist.  END
BEGIN NOW He believes in the existence of the market, that the market have no rules, no protection, no governance.  END
BEGIN NOW That the people distribute, sell, buy and take at will and negotiate between themselves like civilized human beings.  END
BEGIN NOW Or uncivilized if that’s the way it has to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Many people would classify Bitchnuts as a hustler.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a gross oversimplification.  END
BEGIN NOW This is far from a decent description of Bitchnuts.  END
BEGIN NOW We should begin at how Bitchnuts earned his name. END
BEGIN NOW In his early days as an instigator, Bitchnuts was known to cause a ruckus or two.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a reputation he felt compelled to live up to.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a known dealer and something of a pimp.  END
BEGIN NOW He had just started running girls and found the money quite satisfactory.  END
BEGIN NOW Between the dope and hookers, Bitchnuts was pulling some serious clout around the city.  END
BEGIN NOW His reputation spread and word got around to other people in his line of work.  END
BEGIN NOW The other pimps wanted to keep him at bay but he continued to gain power via street corners.  END
BEGIN NOW His influence seemed unstoppable.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the other pimps had an idea to ruin the rep.  END
BEGIN NOW He figured he could embarrass Bitchnuts off the streets a little.  END
BEGIN NOW  Put a little mistrust in the customer.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a working girl that had once been a working boy.  END
BEGIN NOW She still had the balls to prove it, being one more surgery away from the transition.  END
BEGIN NOW The ranks of Bitchnuts’ girls were infiltrated by a pair of stealth testicles.  END
BEGIN NOW Upon discovery of the intrusion, Bitchnuts went a little crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW He ordered all his girls off the streets at once.  END
BEGIN NOW He was going to investigate each and every one of them.  END
BEGIN NOW He was going to get to the bottom of this.  END
BEGIN NOW He was going to find out “how many of these bitches had nuts.” The original was found three days later floating in the harbor.  END
BEGIN NOW The police didn’t seem to care too much about dead hookers.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially dead hookers with balls and tits. END
BEGIN NOW Spence always regarded Bitchnuts to be an essential stopping point while visiting the Bay Area.  END
BEGIN NOW A visit without Bitchnuts was like spending the longest summer day deep in a cave.  END
BEGIN NOW A visit to Bitchnuts also ensured replenishing his stock of cannabis.  END
BEGIN NOW Bitchnuts was a good dealer if you were good to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He ensured his product and that could be taken to mean you always got your money’s worth.  END
BEGIN NOW Depending on how much your money was worth to Bitchnuts. END
BEGIN NOW The sign on the road contains pictograms showcasing the upcoming attractions such as food, shelter, gas, and so much more.  END
BEGIN NOW Welcome to Santa Rosa.  END
BEGIN NOW The Saintly Rose of a city.  END
BEGIN NOW Nestled right before the state gets interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Last major city before the sprawl begins.  END
BEGIN NOW One more hour and it’s going to be nonstop urban, concrete and steel, never ending sidewalks, light rails, buses, subways, skyscrapers, subdivisions, billboards, billboards, billboards. END
BEGIN NOW Santa Rosa wants you to spend as much money as you can before you lose it all in the big city.  END
BEGIN NOW Santa Rosa is hoping that you will stop and spend the night in one of the many hotels or motels.  END
BEGIN NOW This would be an ideal place to stop for gas and a cup of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe sit down, have a decent meal.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ve been on the road for a while and a little break would do you good.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds nice, doesn’t it? A little break, maybe some pie and coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Fill the tank up.  END
BEGIN NOW Spend another hundred dollars for a room for the night.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not too much to ask now, is it? Santa Rosa is your friend.  END
BEGIN NOW Santa Rosa just wants to make sure you have a safe trip. END
BEGIN NOW Spence understands all of this and takes the off ramp.  END
BEGIN NOW He could use a full tank.  END
BEGIN NOW He could use a decent meal.  END
BEGIN NOW But he’s not going to stay overnight.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s asking a little too much.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides he’s only an hour away.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s really not much point in stopping  ow.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun is making towards the horizon like a desperate man approaching a pretty girl at a bar that’s had a little too much to drink.  END
BEGIN NOW The onset of dusk is as sure as waking up in a strange bed from a black out drunken night.  END
BEGIN NOW You will wake up in a unfamiliar room, surrounded by cats and a neurotic man that wears pajamas to bed with a strange woman.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer pulls into a diner of entirely typical characteristics.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a rotating display case featuring a wide selection of pies to choose from.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a counter with an indifferent girl standing behind it.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks up and looks bored at Spencer as he ambles up the counter for a menu and directions for a place to sit.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the seating will be open for occupation.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer takes a corner booth with a good view of the parking lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Night is coming in quickly and the scene will change in the city.  END
BEGIN NOW The attitude will shift into a new mode.  END
BEGIN NOW The people will be night people, the ones that wake up when everyone else is going to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Spencer barely looks over the menu.  END
BEGIN NOW He came here for pie and coffee and that’s all he plans on getting.  END
BEGIN NOW That the diner serves breakfast all day is of little interest.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as they serve pie right now.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that matters.  END
BEGIN NOW A girl that can’t be more than twenty five or less than nineteen approaches. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, I’m Kate.” She has a name tag and everything in case you forget.  END
BEGIN NOW “Did you need a little more time or have you decided? Would you like to start with something to drink?” END
BEGIN NOW “Hi Kate, I’m Spencer.  END
BEGIN NOW And no, I don’t think I’ll be  eeding anymore time.  END
BEGIN NOW The menu wasn’t of much use to me.  END
BEGIN NOW See, I came here for some pie and coffee and that’s all I want.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a pie and a lot of coffee.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, alrighty then.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what kind of pie you’d like?” END
BEGIN NOW “That butter pecan looks excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW How do you feel about it?” END
BEGIN NOW “Honestly, I haven’t had much of our pies.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m more of an eggs and steak kind of girl.” END
BEGIN NOW “I see.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, is it worth it, do you think? Getting a whole butter pecan pie and washing it down with a bunch of coffee.”  END
BEGIN NOW “That doesn’t sound half bad.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I couldn’t see that as an entirely bad set of circumstances to be thrown into.  END
BEGIN NOW Pie and coffee are mighty tasty.”  The waitress flicks her hair out of her face.  END
BEGIN NOW She let the hair drift there for the specific purpose of being able to twist her head rapidly, throwing a few strands out there.  END
BEGIN NOW Like waving a flag for attention.  END
BEGIN NOW She found that flicking her hair had increased her tip percentage.  END
BEGIN NOW She found the results greatly in her favor.  END
BEGIN NOW Little tricks like that always helped.  END
BEGIN NOW Kate writes down pecan and coffee on her ticket.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes the ticket to the counter and tears the page from her note book.  END
BEGIN NOW The pie is removed from a refrigerator in the back and cut into equal slices.  END
BEGIN NOW Whole pies have their own type of plate to be presented on.  END
BEGIN NOW Much more grandiose then their single slice counter parts.  END
BEGIN NOW Kate fetches a whole carafe of coffee and brings both items to the table.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer waits with hungry eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He starts into the pie with a spoon, taking large mouthfuls and washing them down half chewed with hot, black coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW He chews just enough to swallow and continues ravenously for while in this manner.  END
BEGIN NOW  The coffee cup is refilled every few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW Spencer chews while looking out the window at the sun setting behind the Pacific Ocean, just past the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at the nearby hills being bathed in the half light of dusk.  END
BEGIN NOW An hour from now, he thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW An hour from now and we’ll be back in the bay.  END
BEGIN NOW This should be fun. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twenty-Two: END
BEGIN NOW Being an old woman means you have certain privileges.  END
BEGIN NOW Being old usually means garnering the respect of those that are younger and less experienced with life.  END
BEGIN NOW Being old means you’ve had to deal with a lot of shit for a long time and now you’ve earned the right to rest a while and take it easy.  END
BEGIN NOW Being old only means this if you have a retirement plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise you’re left to go crazy and wander the streets with an impressive collection of garbage bags filled with total nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone in the suburbs, an old woman lives off the ghost of her husband.  END
BEGIN NOW His money is still alive and that’s all that’s keeping Juniper Gladstone off the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper is frowning at her meager garden.  END
BEGIN NOW The daffodils have been misbehaving lately.  END
BEGIN NOW They tend to droop and sag and wilt.  END
BEGIN NOW Too heavy for their stems or the stems are too weak to hold them up anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW She suspects that the devil is starting to get to her flowers. END
BEGIN NOW She suspects that the devil is acting through her yard maintenance man.  END
BEGIN NOW The devil is lifting a bottle of gin to his lips and causing him to forget when and how much to water everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The devil is making certain sections of the lawn grow faster than others.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper frowns at her garden and begins to wonder about exorcism.  END
BEGIN NOW She wanders around the garden and wonders about how productive having an exorcism in her garden would be.  END
BEGIN NOW  She saw on the news how another church not too far from her had gone up in flames.  END
BEGIN NOW She was convinced there was a devil pulling strings.  END
BEGIN NOW Decent people just didn’t going around burning churches.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s just not something people do.  END
BEGIN NOW If decent people had started burning churches, we were all doomed.  END
BEGIN NOW  Who knows where they would stop.  END
BEGIN NOW Rape and murder were not far away at that point.  END
BEGIN NOW The point where someone decides to burn a church down. END
BEGIN NOW Juniper wanders around the garden with a mug of tea and looks at her flowers in various states of decay.  END
BEGIN NOW The gardenias are starting to droop.  END
BEGIN NOW The bulbs are beginning to bruise and slack off.  END
BEGIN NOW The roses are looking like a valentine that was left in the display window along with a note that no one bothered to sign.  END
BEGIN NOW The lilacs and lilies have turned into brown compost.  END
BEGIN NOW The daises have given up on life.  END
BEGIN NOW The snapdragons have gone south.  END
BEGIN NOW The garden is a tribute to the macabre.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper frowns and looks at her garden and wonders about the Satanists and how far they will go.  END
BEGIN NOW The clouds have started to settle around her ranch house.  END
BEGIN NOW Gathering right over her, it seemed.  END
BEGIN NOW What was once a beautiful day has become a subdued grey, heavy with foreboading and inkling undercurrent of terrible things to come.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper looks up and squints at the sky.  END
BEGIN NOW Her slack floral print dress doesn’t feel so warm any more.  END
BEGIN NOW She drinks her tea and frowns, furrowing her brow and growing more discontent with her surroundings by the minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Standing in her garden and taking note of the rot and decay around her, Juniper wanders what god is thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW How could he let this happen.  END
BEGIN NOW She tithed.  END
BEGIN NOW She attended every service.  END
BEGIN NOW When the charities came around knocking on her door, looking for donations, she was never stingy.  END
BEGIN NOW What had she ever done that was unfavorable in god’s eyes?  END
BEGIN NOW The rain started softly, in drops and a few lazy sprinkles.  END
BEGIN NOW Down came everything the clouds couldn’t hold.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper stood in the rain, unmoving, drinking her tea and scowling at her garden.  END
BEGIN NOW She stood in her garden for twenty minutes, letting every drop hit her grey hair, her wrinkled face, her floral print dress and the dead flowers.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper decided that the growing apathy of the world around her needed to stop.  END
BEGIN NOW She needed to wake up the people around her from the growing threat of the Satanists, the devil worshippers.  END
BEGIN NOW The misguided youth.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper Marie Gladstone was certain that her last remaining days on earth were meant to serve as a wake up call to the world.  END
BEGIN NOW She would show them the dangers of straying from the good path.  END
BEGIN NOW She would take the devil and put him on a pedestal for everyone to see.  END
BEGIN NOW She wouldn’t hide anything.  END
BEGIN NOW The truth had to be told.  END
BEGIN NOW The lies had to come out of the woodwork.  END
BEGIN NOW Juniper would not rest until she did everything in her power to stop the evils of the world from spreading any further.  END
BEGIN NOW She was on a mission from god. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twenty Three: END
BEGIN NOW The sign glowed iridescent in the hazy overcast lazy Sunday afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW The sign read Palm Reader and large neon hand with fingers spread out, symbols of multiple meanings covered the fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher crosses the street and stands in front of the window.  END
BEGIN NOW  He looks at the palm and tries to see past it, into the shop.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s only a staircase going up a flight, into the unknown.  END
BEGIN NOW He finds the idea strange and a little intriguing.  END
BEGIN NOW Could someone explain my past and predict my future by the lines in my hands? Was it possible that a record of my traits, my tendencies, my patterns were contained between my fingers and thumbs? It had a romantic notion.  END
BEGIN NOW There was something that suggested it was possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it was all cold reading and bullshit.  END
BEGIN NOW An elaborate put on.  END
BEGIN NOW A shysters game to take money from fools.  END
BEGIN NOW But if you didn’t have any money, there was nothing to lose.  END
BEGIN NOW Just time and the ramblings of someone that may or may not have been related to gypsies. END
BEGIN NOW The word gypsy is a bastardization of Egyptian.  END
BEGIN NOW And Egypt is supposedly where a lot of hubbub started, back in the day.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s be theorized that the tarot came from Egypt originally.  END
BEGIN NOW And the tarot turned into the deck of cards popularized by Hoyle and his host of parlor games and later, becoming casino profits.  END
BEGIN NOW The Egyptians were said to possess a knowledge of the afterlife and an in depth spiritual understanding that has yet to be surpassed and will forever be imitated by all the great religions.  END
BEGIN NOW There are bits and pieces of Egyptian spirituality everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW They were a people always intent on what was going to happen next.  END
BEGIN NOW Until there were no more Egyptians.  END
BEGIN NOW Supposedly they dispersed after the whole Moses and Jew debacle.  END
BEGIN NOW Some fleeing to  orthern Europe.  END
BEGIN NOW Some wandering east to Tibet and China.  END
BEGIN NOW Some may have landed in South America and mingled with the Mayans, implanting wacky ideas about the cosmos into their indigenous brains.  END
BEGIN NOW They may be responsible for the original recipe for hot chocolate, which involved the menstrual blood of a virgin instead of sugar to soften the bitterness of raw cacao beans.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher decided to wander up Telegraph a ways and track down Roy One Eye.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy was as good a source as any for information and possibly a little hash.  END
BEGIN NOW Possible always more.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy One Eye couldn’t hide very easily.  END
BEGIN NOW He kinda stood out.  END
BEGIN NOW He sorta stuck out like a dog boner at a cat show.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy One Eye had one eye tattooed on his forehead.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes were headlights a mile away down a straight mountain tunnel.  END
BEGIN NOW Distant sources of light from far away.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy was mostly meat.  END
BEGIN NOW His face framed his eyes like a side of beef.  END
BEGIN NOW Like two candles floating in the low water of a well made from raw hamburger.  END
BEGIN NOW His body hung at his sides like salami in a deli window.  END
BEGIN NOW His fingers were sausages and his legs were Christmas hams.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy always has his one eye open and the other two closed.  END
BEGIN NOW He sleeps in between the doorway of a shop that has boarded up windows.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a blanket until yesterday.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone stole it while he was looking for a quiet place to shit. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher walks up to Roy One Eye and knocks five times one the wall by his head.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy knocks a few times and Beecher response following and deviating slightly, toying with his rhythm.  END
BEGIN NOW Noodling around with his jam.  END
BEGIN NOW Playing with his concept of a pattern.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy One Eye looks up, that is, he faces Beecher’s general direction. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey man.  END
BEGIN NOW Where the hell have you been? Beecher, I thought you were dead.” END
BEGIN NOW “Not quite yet, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m still ticking.  END
BEGIN NOW They haven’t stopped me yet.  END
BEGIN NOW What have you been up to Roy? END
BEGIN NOW “Oh you know, sitting around, bullshitting.  END
BEGIN NOW Listening to the odd bits that float my way.  END
BEGIN NOW How about yourself? It’s been like a few years.  END
BEGIN NOW  You must have had had a few interesting experiences.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, some things happened.  END
BEGIN NOW Some things didn’t happen.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a while.” END
BEGIN NOW “Man, the last time I saw you, there were students, and they were uppity about something or other.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, they tend to be excitable.  END
BEGIN NOW Comes and goes.” END
BEGIN NOW “So man, what brings you around? You’re not one to roam without an intended goal.” END
BEGIN NOW “Most times, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Most times.  END
BEGIN NOW This time I just felt like it was a good day to be in Berkeley.” END
BEGIN NOW “That sounds about right.  END
BEGIN NOW It is a good day in Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW I got word this morning about a music festival going down in People’s Park.  END
BEGIN NOW Sounds like a good time.  END
BEGIN NOW People having a good time.  END
BEGIN NOW Rocking out.  END
BEGIN NOW Eating spaghetti.  END
BEGIN NOW You heard about this?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I was just up there.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a depressing sort of group up there.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really know.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a very depressing sort of boy that tried to talk to me.  END
BEGIN NOW But all he wanted was a cigarette and the sound of his own voice.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure you understand.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I dig.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean is.  END
BEGIN NOW How was the music?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh well, I left before the music even got started.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure they’ve finished setting up by now.  END
BEGIN NOW They must be pretty much underway.” END
BEGIN NOW “A spaghetti feed? And music.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, I got an idea.  END
BEGIN NOW You haul my blind ass to the park and I’ll make it worth your while.  END
BEGIN NOW I could use some music and a nice place to sit down.  END
BEGIN NOW And a belly full of spaghetti.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ah shit man.  END
BEGIN NOW That ain’t no problem.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do that.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, I was thinking about heading in that direction after the music got started anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Seemed like a great idea.  END
BEGIN NOW And I mean, hey, free spaghetti.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, free spaghetti.  END
BEGIN NOW I could use some food.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, old man.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s wheel you back around.” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher takes Roy One Eye and hauls him to his feet.  END
BEGIN NOW He takes the large meaty man and props him up against his wanderer’s frame.  END
BEGIN NOW Back out from the alcove.  END
BEGIN NOW Balancing on Beecher’s boney legs.  END
BEGIN NOW They make an intriguing three legged race.  END
BEGIN NOW Their ankles are not tied, but they might as well be.  END
BEGIN NOW they hobble down the straight and  arrow path way back to the park.  END
BEGIN NOW On the way Beecher see’s the palm reader. END
BEGIN NOW “You mind if I prop you down in a chair and get my fortune told?  It’s been a while.”  END
BEGIN NOW Roy One Eye nods with lids closed.  END
BEGIN NOW The nod could be interoperated as ‘Yes sir, I do in fact mind a great deal.  END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn’t be talking to fortune tellers when you’re supposed to be taking be to the park, so that I might rest against a wall, with a mouth full of noodles and a head full of jam.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds like a reasonable culmination of event in my life that has lead to the conclusion of where I should be right now; that sounds like the kind of place that I would end up given the culmination of the path my life has taken thus far.’ END
BEGIN NOW Beecher walks the cripple down Telegraph.  END
BEGIN NOW Temporarily deterred by the food ideal.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking over his shoulder at each blinking sign and each red light.  END
BEGIN NOW The two of them hobble along, three legged racing down Telegraph.  END
BEGIN NOW They make their way in front of the palm reader and Beecher calls halt.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher calls for a stop in their progression.  END
BEGIN NOW Roy One Eye has a choice to either wait in the stiff chaired waiting room, or outside on the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW The sidewalk is much more agreeable. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher walks up a flight of wood base on concrete steps.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns towards the only door offered to him and knocks a few times in slow succession.  END
BEGIN NOW The door opens a crack and an old woman’s eye answers him. END
BEGIN NOW “Hello,” she says, “What brings you here?” END
BEGIN NOW “I seek the light, and what lies beyond.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well then, give me a second.” The door closes in Beecher’s face.  END
BEGIN NOW He pictures the town psychic tidying up her séance room in order to finally get some business.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a filing all the lost socks at the laundry mat away under false hopes and misguided dreams.  END
BEGIN NOW The door opens a few moments later.  END
BEGIN NOW A woman wearing far too many bracelets answers the door.  END
BEGIN NOW She may have been the woman that originally shut the door in his face.  END
BEGIN NOW But there is no time for such contemplation.  END
BEGIN NOW  Beecher enters the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher has climbed the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW All he can expect right now, is how a stranger will interoperate his future. END
BEGIN NOW The steps become larger with each movement of the foot.  END
BEGIN NOW The length between stretches of the leg becomes longer with each shift in cardiovascular dynamics.  END
BEGIN NOW The last door is reached and the woman that answers does so with frilly, out of control hair and a demeanor of cosmic indifference.  END
BEGIN NOW The woman behind the curtain is obviously trying to get by.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t have a nine hundred number or an addresses that will make her popular on late night television.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s the kind of genuine physchic that I have been advising people I have known my whole life from seeing.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly because I fear what will happened when people I have known my whole life go out and seek the truth.  END
BEGIN NOW But the palm reader is a reliable source.  END
BEGIN NOW She expects nothing except ten dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW And you should expect nothing except a ten dollar evaluation of your existence.  END
BEGIN NOW  That’s the kind of attitude the Beecher had upon entering the palm reader’s building.  END
BEGIN NOW Or should I say, having been dragged into the palm reader’s building by the woman in question herself.  END
BEGIN NOW  She lived above a failed dollar store. END
BEGIN NOW That should say enough.  END
BEGIN NOW The failed psychic lived above the dollar store, but the store failed and the psychic remained in business.  END
BEGIN NOW That was how Berkeley operated.  END
BEGIN NOW Find a new guru, ignore the old one.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone you met in Berkeley had already been down the road you were thinking of traveling.  END
BEGIN NOW Therefore they served a simultaneous purpose of being a source of knowledge and storytelling, while fulfilling the duel purpose of being a source of entertainment.  END
BEGIN NOW  This was especially apparent in the bars or Berkeley.  END
BEGIN NOW The Palm reader invited Beecher upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite his economic display.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite the fact that all Beecher had to offer society was advice and words of warning.  END
BEGIN NOW The old woman began flipping over cards, feeling around Beecher’s palm for signs of validation to the lines she read in his palm.  END
BEGIN NOW “Your palm tells me that you have lived a rich life.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well yeah, I suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW I Went along the rail and met quite a few characters that little or much to help me out.  END
BEGIN NOW I continued to seek and looked everywhere for an answer.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the students began doing the same thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Then I turned to uppers and downers and whatever else came my way and found a kind of balance.  END
BEGIN NOW I found out who I was and which chemicals I responded to in a positive or negative manner.” END
BEGIN NOW The lady continues, “You palm tells me that you have ideals, which remain stagnant inside of you.  END
BEGIN NOW That you have been called to a higher purpose which you refuse to accept.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead you wander around the wayside.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking for distraction.  END
BEGIN NOW Hoping for some kind of disillusionment that will allow you to overcome your present circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW You will continually be at odds with your inner most desires until you learn to confront the fact that you are a leader, and that you have the drive to lead people to a better understanding of their lives.  END
BEGIN NOW You have been holding back, waiting for your day to come when you never realized that your day was already here.  END
BEGIN NOW  You  eed to take hold of today and turn it into the day you finally realize your destiny.  END
BEGIN NOW When you take charge of the machine.” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher digs out two dollars in quarters.  END
BEGIN NOW He figures that’s worth the price of the future.  END
BEGIN NOW  He hears the melody to Dark Star and limps Roy to People’s Park for a better earshot view of the goings on.  END
BEGIN NOW The concert and spaghetti feed is in full effect.  END
BEGIN NOW People have gathered from all walks of the Bay Area experience.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea of free pasta brought them here.  END
BEGIN NOW The sound of original intent reminded them of years long past.  END
BEGIN NOW  On stage was a band consisting of only two guitar players and a drummer.  END
BEGIN NOW The Drummer seemed to be stabilizing the rhythm as opposed to setting it.  END
BEGIN NOW He listened and adapted to the change of the guitar.  END
BEGIN NOW The citizens of the park continued on, sleeping on logs and milling about in the garden.  END
BEGIN NOW The students with less to do, wandered in to the garden and tried to follow their way back to the original melody.  END
BEGIN NOW They traveled far and wide to see a consistent point of view.  END
BEGIN NOW To actualize something greater then themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW They took buses and trains.  END
BEGIN NOW They checked Craig’s List for rideshares.  END
BEGIN NOW The criss crossed the country in search of something to belong too.  END
BEGIN NOW Just something with a loud voice and lots of hooting and hollering.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a place to feel safe screaming your lungs out at the slightest change, be it for good or bad or just someone’s honest mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that mattered.  END
BEGIN NOW Participation numbers.  END
BEGIN NOW Get enough people to join the cause, and suddenly you have a congregation.  END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly you have a following.  END
BEGIN NOW Now what? Do you steer them onto the path of self fulfillment or the path of a higher power leading them in the morally right, safe to raise children kind of environment.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean really.  END
BEGIN NOW Of all the things people could be raising their kids to be, at least they’re not violent revolutionaries that would cut off my hands because I bought a cup of Starbucks’ coffee back in the day and completely forgot about the whole experience.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe it happened multiple times and I failed to see the connection.  END
BEGIN NOW The point is.  END
BEGIN NOW The point being.  END
BEGIN NOW That I forgot what it was like to be in Beecher’s position.  END
BEGIN NOW Half drunk, half a bum in the chair of a beauty school short timing.  END
BEGIN NOW “So, like.  END
BEGIN NOW How short are we talking?” She holds a clipper and a pair of scissors.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s ready to do some damage.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been holed up in beauty school long enough to go mad.  END
BEGIN NOW She wants to really cut some hair.  END
BEGIN NOW She wants to lay down the law on someone’s scalp.  END
BEGIN NOW She has the skills.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s one month away from graduation. END
BEGIN NOW “Well,  ot quite a month.  END
BEGIN NOW Might take a little longer.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a few loose ends to tie up.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a few more tests.” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll do fine.  END
BEGIN NOW If you need me to be here as a shining example of your work then so be it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m more than happy too.” END
BEGIN NOW Beecher was not so lucky.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher leaves the shop, refusing to pay for his hair cut.  END
BEGIN NOW Complaining about incompetence on behave of the bartenders, the bouncers, and the other barflies.  END
BEGIN NOW He accuses them all of hypocrisy, which is impressive enough.  END
BEGIN NOW This demographic is such that it has committed it’s self to none whatsoever.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher looks across the street and sees a sign for an up and coming bread and cheese shop.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks, well, there’s a return to ideals.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a business plan set on the idea of human understanding.  END
BEGIN NOW The concept of sustainability is typically only accessible to those who can afford it. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher wheels Roy to a suitable spot and leaves with promises of spaghetti upon his return.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher approaches the table, long clothed in white, burdened with large bowls full of spaghetti.  END
BEGIN NOW Acting as over dramatic paper weights to the light autumn breeze of early November.  END
BEGIN NOW The sauce sits in separate bowls and Beecher goes to smother his two plates with enough sauce to compliment each serving of noodles.  END
BEGIN NOW He asks where the jam is located and each time he’s pointed in the direction of the stage. END
BEGIN NOW A band has been playing for the last few hours, showing no sign of stopping or slowing down.  END
BEGIN NOW The band has called themselves C.O.R.P.S.E.  END
BEGIN NOW and consist of two guitar players and a drummer.  END
BEGIN NOW The drummer only acts as a stabilizing element to the call and response jam band esthetics of the two guitar players.  END
BEGIN NOW They drift around from blues to blue grass to country folk and classic rock and roll.  END
BEGIN NOW They continually drift.  END
BEGIN NOW That seems to be a suitable way to sum up their musical activity.  END
BEGIN NOW Always in transition from one movement to another.  END
BEGIN NOW Always moving forward or backwards.  END
BEGIN NOW From past influence to present prediction to social commentary.  END
BEGIN NOW The  otes always seemed to fall somewhere around there.  END
BEGIN NOW Never quite beyond, never quite hitting accurately.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how CORPSE played.  END
BEGIN NOW And they played a mean set.  END
BEGIN NOW The three of them would keep going until a member of another band that was supposed to be up next joined in.  END
BEGIN NOW He would start up and the rest of his band would follow suit until CORPSE would fade off stage, only to return to fill the silence when  eeded, never being a full stop or a conclusive undertaking.  END
BEGIN NOW At People’s Park that day, hundreds of kids gathered, a bunch of hold over hippies lived again in the days of their youth.  END
BEGIN NOW The possibilities were once again, endless.  END
BEGIN NOW The potential was once again, revitalized.  END
BEGIN NOW  The idea that the world was really as malleable as we once believed.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea that total world peace wasn’t just a pipe dream.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea that true benefits could be felt along all walks of life, no matter how spread out and difficult and different they were.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always a chance of reconciliation.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always the hope of a new beginning.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter how bad and how turbulent events around us seemed, we could, in fact, overcome.  END
BEGIN NOW Choosing to either overcome or maintain the status quo.  END
BEGIN NOW The status quo was easy enough.  END
BEGIN NOW We had to change, virtually, nothing about anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Just continue the same patterns despite circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW Pretend that the present shift in politics meant nothing to any of us.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that was required of us to keep on keepin’ on and that’s what most of us did.  END
BEGIN NOW We still punched in to our day jobs.  END
BEGIN NOW We still collected our checks.  END
BEGIN NOW We still slept and left home at hours, coinciding with the time we had to be present at places of employment, no matter how fulfilling they happened to be.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher listened to the band play and mouthed a mouth full of spaghetti.  END
BEGIN NOW He listened and contemplated the direction and outcome of everything that was happening around him.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher chewed his noodles and eyed the stage, thinking about the gift from Roy One Eye.  END
BEGIN NOW The gift of a few fun guys.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea OF A couple of  ow digesting mushrooms making their way into conscious reality.  END
BEGIN NOW If the mushrooms were right than moving out of the city was the only viable alternative.  END
BEGIN NOW If the mushrooms were right then the only means of reconciliation were to consume, experience and report.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a coming of age ritual for the disenfranchised.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher listened to the band for what seemed like a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW He was noticibly stoned.  END
BEGIN NOW Upon entering People’s Park he was greeted with the alternative of staying sober or mingling with the crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW The Crowd already seemed sufficiently baked.  END
BEGIN NOW  There was no need to stimulate farther.  END
BEGIN NOW But a room to cook dinner in.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a while. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher walked down Telegraph a ways and decided to walk back up to Sproul.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to get a good long look at the University.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to see the tower rise above the fog and shine over the existence of how many years he had been alive.  END
BEGIN NOW Or how many years he had walked the earth.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted a land mark or a light mark to signal that he wasn’t exactly that old.  END
BEGIN NOW That he was still growing.  END
BEGIN NOW That there was still more to do.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher wanders into the restroom at People’s Park and looks at himself in the mirror. END
BEGIN NOW The image that greets Beecher isn’t one of grandiose appeal or social acceptance.  END
BEGIN NOW He has not the face of a revolutionary or a social figure that will lead the people to greatness.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes are too soft.  END
BEGIN NOW His countenance is too flimsy.  END
BEGIN NOW He could be either the hero or the arch villain.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the two, but neither the middle man.  END
BEGIN NOW He is too extreme to be caught in between. END
BEGIN NOW Beecher eyes him wearily.  END
BEGIN NOW As if he might Bogart his position in life.  END
BEGIN NOW As if he might be the milkman that no one forgot.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher is content to live forever.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher has finally accepted his role as permanent figure in the drama of life on planet earth.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher has eaten half a pound of psychedelic mushrooms and decided to look in the mirror to see what’s new. END
BEGIN NOW In the mirror his beard is the same.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s the same shaggy length coupled with the growth of a few weeks entangled in the ritual of neglected threads.  END
BEGIN NOW Where each hair finds a new path to grow on.  END
BEGIN NOW Where each hair finds a new place to live for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Beecher sees himself in the mirror and thinks, ‘my god, I could use a bit of a haircut, maybe a shave.’ END
BEGIN NOW Chapter Twenty-Four. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, shit, what do you make of it? This shit is pretty fucking close to home.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t like it.  END
BEGIN NOW This is getting a bit out of hand, Pete.” END
BEGIN NOW Pete looks at the smoldering ashes.  END
BEGIN NOW The half burned beams with once upon a time white paint flecking to the ground in piles near the foundation.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a scowl like a winter coat.  END
BEGIN NOW Close to the neck, drawn up tight and pulled close.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks a bit pissed off at the wreckage. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Reverend.  END
BEGIN NOW How old did you say this parish was? I mean, how long have you been here? Long enough to have enemies? Did your church do anything like picket Planned Parenthood?” END
BEGIN NOW Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael stares through the smoke screen of what used to be his church.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks right through the debris.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks ten years into the past and five years into the future simultaneously.  END
BEGIN NOW His face is as readable as Sanskrit to a two year old.  END
BEGIN NOW Words dance around near the tip of his tongue but nothing is going to sound quite right at the moment.  END
BEGIN NOW His whole life up until this point has officially been destroyed.  END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing left except the house he lives in.  END
BEGIN NOW Without a church to maintain, without a family to provide for.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s a finished man.  END
BEGIN NOW “No.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I don’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW The enemies of the lord and what not…” He trails off and stares again right through and onward.  END
BEGIN NOW Detective Addison looks the good reverend up and down.  END
BEGIN NOW Years of cop school, psychology classes, profiling, evidence, years of looking people up and down for a hint of some kind of malice, a clue, a lead, something to go on.  END
BEGIN NOW The good reverend is not an easy read.  END
BEGIN NOW He seems to be avoiding readability.  END
BEGIN NOW He might be a more than a little shell shocked.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well, if you can think of any reason, anything at all, that might have lead to this.  END
BEGIN NOW Let us know.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re available any time, any day.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve been on this case for a month or more now.” END
BEGIN NOW Reverend Carmichael takes a business card and continues looking at nothing in general.  END
BEGIN NOW He says thanks like listening to an echo from last week.  END
BEGIN NOW The reverend isn’t in right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Please leave a message.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll get back to you as soon as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Beep. END
BEGIN NOW Addison extracts a cigarette and lights up.  END
BEGIN NOW The time and place seem just right for a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a lot on his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s seen the case files from a dozen or so similar incidents.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the first time he’s been face to face with the real deal.  END
BEGIN NOW The ashes and smoke and timber and coals and the good reverend watching the remains of his life smolder and die right in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW The actuality of the case now firm and present in his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew this day would arrive.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a good gut instinct.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those things that makes being a detective possible.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s trying to tie all the angles together.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s trying to make some kind of sense of all the clues.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete Templeton is wandering around the wreckage, kicking at remains and seemingly lost without someone to bully into answers.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Pete, I’ve seen enough here.  END
BEGIN NOW You got any ideas?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nothing at the moment.  END
BEGIN NOW I might have something.  END
BEGIN NOW This does look like a group effort.  END
BEGIN NOW But still.  END
BEGIN NOW No calling card.  END
BEGIN NOW Very strange for a hate crime.  END
BEGIN NOW No nothing to remember anyone by.  END
BEGIN NOW Say preacher, no threatening letters? No nothing yeah?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah,” The good reverend says, “nothing at all.  END
BEGIN NOW Just what’s left of my church.” END
BEGIN NOW “I see.” Pete says, kicking a still burning ceiling beam. END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s get out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW Try and make some sense of this mess back at the station.” Addison flicks the butt of his cigarette into the ashes. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.” Pete heads back to the patrol car. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, look Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve been on this case for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of background but this is the first local incident.  END
BEGIN NOW Let us know if you hear anything.” END
BEGIN NOW “I will.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll keep you informed of any developments on my end.” END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 25: END
BEGIN NOW “You’re pathetic.” END
BEGIN NOW “C’mon sis.  END
BEGIN NOW Help me out here.” END
BEGIN NOW “The kind of help you need involves my foot and your snatch.” END
BEGIN NOW “But what should I do? Roscoe’s still in jail.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, should I visit him? Will they arrest me if I walk in there?” END
BEGIN NOW “Figure it out, Lars.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t make decisions for you.  END
BEGIN NOW If I were you, I’d just leave him there.  END
BEGIN NOW He got in, he’s going to have to get out.  END
BEGIN NOW His problems are not your problems.  END
BEGIN NOW Deal.  END
BEGIN NOW How’s Berkeley? How’re my boys?” END
BEGIN NOW “Madness.  END
BEGIN NOW I think the boys are starting an army or a cult.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a band.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW All these kids drop by.  END
BEGIN NOW They call them gromits.  END
BEGIN NOW The gromits buy lots of weed though.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve just been cooking and cleaning and walking to the black sand beach.” END
BEGIN NOW “That sounds nice.” END
BEGIN NOW “There’s no sand at the black sand beach! Just rocks!” END
BEGIN NOW “Sounds like something The Shambles would say.” END
BEGIN NOW “Is that actually his name? Why is he called The Shambles?” END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, he is shambility.  END
BEGIN NOW And The Mess is a mess.” END
BEGIN NOW “Right.  END
BEGIN NOW Of course.  END
BEGIN NOW How stupid of me.” END
BEGIN NOW “Pretty much.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Marji.” END
BEGIN NOW “Anytime.  END
BEGIN NOW Look, I gotta run.  END
BEGIN NOW Figure it out.  END
BEGIN NOW Deal.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ll be fine.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, bye.” END
BEGIN NOW What a swell sister.  END
BEGIN NOW Couldn’t ask for a better one if there was a catalog and all the big sisters were barcoded with make and model numbers and everything.  END
BEGIN NOW I was already walking around in the suburbs, heading northish.  END
BEGIN NOW I took a mean right and wound up on San Pablo.  END
BEGIN NOW San Pablo is one of those streets that stretches in a straight line across counties.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a pattern or a poem written in stone brick mortar of motor car repair.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe more of a mantra.  END
BEGIN NOW Brakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Transmission.  END
BEGIN NOW Tires.  END
BEGIN NOW Brakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Transmission.  END
BEGIN NOW Tires.  END
BEGIN NOW Smog.  END
BEGIN NOW Smog.  END
BEGIN NOW Smog.  END
BEGIN NOW The pattern is broken by the odd restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW The exceptional corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW A church or two.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve walked down San Pablo in the late afternoon enough times to memorize the placement.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m intimately familiar with cracks in the paint.  END
BEGIN NOW The billboards that offer me nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Geographically, I pass through African America, two blocks of Mexico, and if I went all the way to the corner of University, I’d be in India.  END
BEGIN NOW The late autumn, later afternoon sun pulls the shadows out of and stretches them against the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW Question: What’s red and black on a white background? Answer: The sign in front of the Acme Bar.  END
BEGIN NOW The door is open and right now seems like a great time for booze and contemplation. END
BEGIN NOW My eyes adjust to the light or lack thereof.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the bar stools are empty and that’s fine.  END
BEGIN NOW A wall clock reads four-thirty, but I don’t believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW The man behind the counter is built like a fighter.  END
BEGIN NOW If he wasn’t wearing glasses, I’d mistake him for the door man.  END
BEGIN NOW His tattoos seem like extensions of his shirt sleeves.  END
BEGIN NOW His demeanor is kind and welcoming.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a whiskey and ice kind of afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW The other two patrons came with the building.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a line in the mortgage about them.  END
BEGIN NOW If the bar ever changes hands, the two old men stay with permenantly reserved seating.  END
BEGIN NOW Draft beer in bottomless pint glasses and carte blanche of the rules.  END
BEGIN NOW Except the no smoking before nine rule.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s three no smoking signs and a display box of cigarettes next to the coffee pot.  END
BEGIN NOW Right where it belongs. END
BEGIN NOW “You remember Craig Bloomsdale?” One of the men sets his beer down. END
BEGIN NOW “Face like a Buick?” says the other, lifting his beer to his lips. END
BEGIN NOW “That’s the one!” He picks up his beer again. END
BEGIN NOW “How is that motherfucker?” He sets his glass down. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, he died.” END
BEGIN NOW “Are you serious?” END
BEGIN NOW “Completely.  END
BEGIN NOW His old lady called me up this morning.  END
BEGIN NOW All tears n’ shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Said he fell over watering the lawn.  END
BEGIN NOW The goddamn lawn.  END
BEGIN NOW Just fell over dead.  END
BEGIN NOW Just kinda gave up on life I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW Poor old Craig.” END
BEGIN NOW “For Craig!” END
BEGIN NOW “For Craig!” END
BEGIN NOW The old timers raise their beers and drain them, setting down their glasses with a polite show of force.  END
BEGIN NOW Just enough enthusiasm for drinking at a place that’s not exactly home.  END
BEGIN NOW Extending the courtesy to handle someone else’s glassware with enough care not to cause problems.  END
BEGIN NOW The old men were their own kind of timeless charm.  END
BEGIN NOW Myself, I preferred my whiskey burn and a good wall to stare at. END
BEGIN NOW Where to go from here? Shall I try to rescue the boy? Blow down the jail and run away to South America? Maybe Canada? Maybe get in touch with the Canadians that put him there in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe they could help.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I should just abandon him and start over.  END
BEGIN NOW Berkeley wasn’t such a bad town.  END
BEGIN NOW I was beginning to know my way around.  END
BEGIN NOW I now had enough connections to develop my own weed operation.  END
BEGIN NOW And the boys.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, hell.  END
BEGIN NOW What would the boys do without me? I was like their goddamn den mother.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d fall apart without me around.  END
BEGIN NOW I took a long pull off my glass, the ice melting enough to ease the burn.  END
BEGIN NOW Jesus, I thought, I’m turning into a drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW I used to be such a pothead.  END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW You know what? Fuck Roscoe.  END
BEGIN NOW He dug his own hole.  END
BEGIN NOW None of that is my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Now I’m homeless because of him.  END
BEGIN NOW Let him rot away.  END
BEGIN NOW Might do him good.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, what did he ever really do for me? What have I ever gained from that pathetic pushover? Homelessness and short term memory loss.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck that guy.  END
BEGIN NOW I can get another man.  END
BEGIN NOW I can find another mate.  END
BEGIN NOW We were just used to each other enough.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all.  END
BEGIN NOW We were comfortable with each other’s shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Marji was right.  END
BEGIN NOW Sis, god bless you.  END
BEGIN NOW I toast my invisible sister and down the hatch, empty glass acrobat that I am.  END
BEGIN NOW And a shot, why not down it goes and god it feels so good to be free fuck that hippie.  END
BEGIN NOW I never liked Phish anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW I look at the clock and the sun is going away for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Fine with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck the sun.  END
BEGIN NOW Bring on the moon.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me the stars.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me darkness and streetlights.  END
BEGIN NOW Give me mood lighting and whatever. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey! Tats! Shot of Ferny, ginger back.  END
BEGIN NOW Follow with more whiskey on ice.  END
BEGIN NOW Matter of fact.  END
BEGIN NOW How much for the bottle? Cool if I just nurse that bottle by myself.  END
BEGIN NOW I might as well.  END
BEGIN NOW That bottle and me, we’re best friends.  END
BEGIN NOW We go way back.  END
BEGIN NOW That bottled and me used to sit in parking lots together while you lazy fucks,” and here I point at everyone in the room, all three of them, “You lazy fucks went to school.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck you, guy.”  END
BEGIN NOW I take a nice pull and make whiskey face when I come back around.  END
BEGIN NOW The barman comes over a little concerned, a little amused.  END
BEGIN NOW I ain’t the toughest looking bitch in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW “You doing alright miss? Need a cab or something? Kinda early for that talk.” He takes the bottle away from me and puts it back on the shelf.  END
BEGIN NOW He also takes my empty glass. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh,” I said, “don’t mind me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m having a midlife crisis.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve just decided to leave my boy and let fly with life.  END
BEGIN NOW What do I owe you?” END
BEGIN NOW “Fifty and we’re square.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure you don’t need a cab?” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re a sweetheart.  END
BEGIN NOW Really, don’t mind me.  END
BEGIN NOW I need some time alone.  END
BEGIN NOW I might go scream at something that understands me.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like the black sand beach.” END
BEGIN NOW “Suit yourself.” END
BEGIN NOW “There’s no sand at the black sand beach! Only rocks!” I slap money on the counter, tell the old men, “Fuck you!” and laugh and tell them I’m just joking.  END
BEGIN NOW I like this bar.  END
BEGIN NOW I might be back.  END
BEGIN NOW I might not.  END
BEGIN NOW I like this bar. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter One: Two Eggs, Over Seas. END
BEGIN NOW Flights out of Romania are few and far between.  END
BEGIN NOW Flights to San Francisco from Romania are long and expensive.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole of the trip takes a god awful long time.  END
BEGIN NOW There are meals and snacks and beverage services along the way to sustain those seated passengers.  END
BEGIN NOW The meal cart is kreeling down the aisle.  END
BEGIN NOW A woman in uniform stops and steadies the whole thing while a man in similar uniform begins handing out mashed potatoes, roast beef and peas.  END
BEGIN NOW It was made without care and with minimal human contact.  END
BEGIN NOW The potatoes are tasteless .  END
BEGIN NOW There was no one there to check the salt and ensure that proper seasoning measures were taken.  END
BEGIN NOW The potatoes were freeze dried in a powdery state.  END
BEGIN NOW The peas received similar treatment.  END
BEGIN NOW The roast beef is cooked all the way through, dry as a paper towel and about as nourishing.  END
BEGIN NOW  One of these containers lands on the tray table of a woman in her mid forties.  END
BEGIN NOW She has long, wild fire chestnut hair covered by a modest shawl.  END
BEGIN NOW  She looks out like a caged, predatory bird through obsidian black eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her dress was made by her mother near twenty years previous.  END
BEGIN NOW The patterns and cloth are nothing familiar to any urban anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW  She took forty minutes to make her way past security.  END
BEGIN NOW Her bracelets and anklets, necklaces and earrings sending off beeps and buzzes and the special type of ruckus that puts airports into a search and destroy frenzy.  END
BEGIN NOW Her jewelry was not found to be any type of weapon.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her motives were not found to be any type of threat.  END
BEGIN NOW Most all of her adornments carried one similarity.  END
BEGIN NOW Hints of blue, hints of water.  END
BEGIN NOW Oceanic would be one way to put it.  END
BEGIN NOW Oceanic like her name, which was Mara.  END
BEGIN NOW Mara d’Niles is in row fourteen, seat D, near the window.  END
BEGIN NOW  She was limited to one carry on item and one small bag, her only luggage.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s poking at the peas and bits of potato.  END
BEGIN NOW She picks up the few meager slices of beef and waves them about, trying to make some kind of sense.  END
BEGIN NOW When the lady in the uniform comes back around with the trash bag, she forcefully tosses the food tray downward inside.  END
BEGIN NOW A gesture of both remorse at her wastefulness, and indignation at being served such shit in the name of edibility.  END
BEGIN NOW  She pulls her leather knap sack from the seat in front of her and extracts a small round loaf of black bread.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls out a small dish of creamed butter and a bit of hen she roasted that morning.  END
BEGIN NOW  Mara flags down the flight attendant every time she passes and keeps her plastic cup of red wine from getting dry.  END
BEGIN NOW She can hold her wine in a way that seems supernatural.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not until the layover in New York that she begins to exhibit any signs of intoxication.  END
BEGIN NOW  The airport in New York City is a wonderland compared to the airport in Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW Mara exchanges her money for American dollars and finds the closest bar.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a few more hours to go.  END
BEGIN NOW A few more hours until San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes out the letter and reads it again. END
BEGIN NOW <Mara Dear, END
BEGIN NOW This may be an odd time, a strange request, and a lot to ask.  END
BEGIN NOW I traced our family tree via several organizations that specialize in that sort of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW As it turns out, you may be my only surviving relative.  END
BEGIN NOW  I’m writing from a bed in a hospital in San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been diagnosed with a malignant cancer of the brain and have some small amount of time left on this earth.  END
BEGIN NOW My possessions are few.  END
BEGIN NOW Before my extended stay in the hospital I owned and ran a small shop in San Francisco, near the Russians and a few other Romanian families.  END
BEGIN NOW There is a room above that was my residence.  END
BEGIN NOW I should like to meet you and hear stories of the home country.  END
BEGIN NOW Of our parents, of life, of you, yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW I should like very much to pass on the little I have here to someone in the family capable of not letting it go to waste.  END
BEGIN NOW I know leaving your home and any life you have made for yourself would be a difficult, to say the least, ordeal to undertake.  END
BEGIN NOW But I feel you should like it here, there being everything a heart could desire within reach.  END
BEGIN NOW Enclosed you will find directions and instructions to get to the hospital, and the information of a dear friend of mine that I have entrusted the shop to in my absence.  END
BEGIN NOW  Do please get in touch with me soon. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister, END
BEGIN NOW Riva d’Niles END
BEGIN NOW Ps.  END
BEGIN NOW Bring the cards.  END
BEGIN NOW > END
BEGIN NOW Mara folds the letter again and places it with care in a pocket near her breast.  END
BEGIN NOW  She takes out a small pouch of tobacco and a pipe.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s never seen a no smoking sign before.  END
BEGIN NOW She puffs away at the end of the bar for several minutes before the bartender walks over and says, END
BEGIN NOW “Excuse me, ma’m, there’s no smoking in this bar.”  END
BEGIN NOW Mara nods and continues smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW She points at one of the bottles on the shelf.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender says, END
BEGIN NOW “Ma’m, do you speak English?” She nods again, blowing a thick cloud of smoke to the side. END
BEGIN NOW “This is a non-smoking establishment ma’m.  END
BEGIN NOW  All bars and clubs in New York City are non-smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t do that here.” He looks tired.  END
BEGIN NOW His job never ends.  END
BEGIN NOW And less people come though that speak and understand English.  END
BEGIN NOW She laughs at him dismissively and points at the bottle again.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender sighs, points at her pipe and shakes his head with stern connotations of disapproval.  END
BEGIN NOW That pipe is very much not allowed to be smoked here.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re going to have to do that outside.  END
BEGIN NOW  But outside would mean going through security again.  END
BEGIN NOW Unacceptable.  END
BEGIN NOW  She points at the bottle again, and he just hopes she smokes quickly and management doesn’t see her.  END
BEGIN NOW He pours a double rye whiskey, neat.  END
BEGIN NOW The bottle she was pointing at was two to the left.  END
BEGIN NOW It was labeled Romana.  END
BEGIN NOW She thought he could figure it out.  END
BEGIN NOW  She downs the double in one swift motion.  END
BEGIN NOW Hand to glass and liquid in mouth before he has time to say another word.  END
BEGIN NOW She coughs and weezes.  END
BEGIN NOW She exhales loudly and coughs again.  END
BEGIN NOW She smiles at him, real big, showing years of dental neglect. END
BEGIN NOW Katherine Bremmer is buttoning up her vest.  END
BEGIN NOW The only person that called her Katherine was her mother, now two years passed away.  END
BEGIN NOW Now two years buried and funeral over and black ties and suits.  END
BEGIN NOW Now two years and Kat is wearing a black skirt, white shirt, and a black vest.  END
BEGIN NOW She has black shoes with no laces and extra padding.  END
BEGIN NOW  If you want to picture her, she stands about five six, one hundred and thirty pounds on a good day.  END
BEGIN NOW Her mother was Irish and her father German.  END
BEGIN NOW A fair smattering of freckles dot across her skin.  END
BEGIN NOW She jogs on her days off and tries to do crunches while watching afternoon television shows that take place in court rooms.  END
BEGIN NOW Her left eye is hazel sometimes and the right is dark brown always.  END
BEGIN NOW She ties her toasted almond brown hair in a bun behind her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She has a few freckles around her nose, which is slightly upturned.  END
BEGIN NOW If you asked her what she considered to be her best feature, she would without shame, tell you that her ass was near perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d have to ask her after a few drinks, otherwise she’d lie and say something like her teeth, or the dimples that only show up when she’s genuinely happy. END
BEGIN NOW She wanted to travel and dropped out of high school at sixteen.  END
BEGIN NOW She could never save money and worked around town anywhere that didn’t require a diploma.  END
BEGIN NOW At eighteen she enrolled at community college in Santa Rosa.  END
BEGIN NOW She dropped out at age twenty three and took a job as a flight attendant.  END
BEGIN NOW  This is the second airline she’s worked for, and has yet to land any shifts on the internationals.  END
BEGIN NOW The work is routine.  END
BEGIN NOW All of those things that jolt or cause anxiety in the average air traveler can be nullified with repetition.  END
BEGIN NOW Her bosses are seldom seen, the paychecks arrive on time, the coworkers are tolerable.  END
BEGIN NOW She rides on planes and distributes foil wrapped snacks and complimentary beer and wine for a living.  END
BEGIN NOW  In the last year she’s covered most of the Eastern sea board, The Pacific Northwest, and the Houston airport.  END
BEGIN NOW  She pesters her superiors for a flight to China, to Nepal, to anywhere in Europe.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, even parts of Africa would be ok.  END
BEGIN NOW But all those lay-overs in Chicago, Las Angeles, St.  END
BEGIN NOW Louis.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re getting to her.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat looks in the mirror, and touches up a conservative make-up job.  END
BEGIN NOW She wrinkles her nose and tilts her head back checking for stray hairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Plucking them makes her eyes water.  END
BEGIN NOW She checks her phone for the time and swears at the mirror at Kennedy International Airport, Gate B15-B19 ladies room.  END
BEGIN NOW In her purse is half a pack of mint chewing gum, an unopened pack of nicotine gum, and three Malboro Reds.  END
BEGIN NOW  She might have to break into the nic gum.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been meaning to quit for the last three years.  END
BEGIN NOW The smell, the cost, the coughs are building up.  END
BEGIN NOW But when it comes down to it, there’s nothing in the world like it.  END
BEGIN NOW That first hit of tobacco in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW The cigarette after a long flight.  END
BEGIN NOW The five she smokes in between vodka drinks at half the bars in airports around the country.  END
BEGIN NOW The cigarette while laying in bed at a strange hotel near the sound of takeoff and landing, taxi cabs, travelers, red eyes and commuter jets.  END
BEGIN NOW The smoke after a good fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW And how long has it been? The most important cigarette is right after a filling meal.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the icing on the nicotine cake.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the one that keeps her from quitting.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s the long bubble bath orgasmic massage cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW The queen of all smoke breaks.  END
BEGIN NOW Her next flight is going to San Francisco, to that apartment she pays rent on, and a good week off.  END
BEGIN NOW  She pictures her bath robe and matching slippers while hustling to gate B17.  END
BEGIN NOW Her refrigerator is going to need restocking.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be a stack of mail, a stack of bills, and a layer of dust on everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The other flight attendants are standing at the gate waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat waves and the other two just look at each other in understanding.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat has stopped caring what anyone else in the company thinks, as long as she can fly for free out of the country.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as she gets to see the world, everyone else can go to hell.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks right past, not waiting for them to say anything.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks outside, lighter and cigarette at the ready for the second those doors close behind her.  END
BEGIN NOW November air sneaks up and creeps up her skirt, sending a wave of goose bumps down her legs, down her arms.  END
BEGIN NOW New York weather.  END
BEGIN NOW Strictly for New Yorkers.  END
BEGIN NOW Any half decent California girl has the sense to stay the hell out of New York in a skirt in November.  END
BEGIN NOW  Kat is not a decent California girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She smokes in the breeze, holding her free arm close to her body, pulling at her left arm holding the cigarette close to her face.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a scowl on her face that creates a five foot radius of hatred around her.  END
BEGIN NOW  She stands in her cold bubble smoking, and looking at the plane.  END
BEGIN NOW “As I was saying, Kat,” His name tag reads Mark and he’s another attendant for Sky Boat International Airlines.  END
BEGIN NOW “As I was saying, Kat, are you listening? The flight has been delayed for maybe, 20 more minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW You should probably find your coat.  END

BEGIN NOW He talks with Sheila and they both look at her and smirk together.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat thinks she could lip read the word bitch cross Sheila’s lips.  END
BEGIN NOW She mouths back, “Fuck you” but no one’s looking at her now. END
BEGIN NOW The cigarette switches hands and she looks at the plane again.  END
BEGIN NOW Always all these delays.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think with all this experience in air travel we’d have it all down by now.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think we would have made reliable enough machines by now.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d think we have this whole air travel thing streamlined by now.  END
BEGIN NOW But no.  END
BEGIN NOW No sir.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not a damn thing streamlined about any kind of travel.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat has spent more time in airports waiting for takeoff then in the air, waiting to land.  END
BEGIN NOW Kat thinks she has spent most of her life waiting.  END
BEGIN NOW She looks at the plane and wonders how many hours were spent in anticipations.  END
BEGIN NOW How many hours in transition.  END
BEGIN NOW How long has she spent in between in betweens?  END
BEGIN NOW Mara has polished off five straight whiskies.  END
BEGIN NOW All bourbon.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s only been in the bar for an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW She hasn’t paid for a single one yet, and laughs every time the bartender tries to coax money out of her.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender grows more vexed every minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Mara keeps laughing at him.  END
BEGIN NOW He still doesn’t know she has a rather solid grasp on the English language.  END
BEGIN NOW She hasn’t said a word in any language, only pointed and laughed.  END
BEGIN NOW  Mara collects her things together, throws a twenty on the bar top and says, END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks, sweet cheeks.”  END
BEGIN NOW A rather solid grasp.  END
BEGIN NOW Mara meanders down the aisles, making her way to the gate.  END
BEGIN NOW Her next flight is San Francisco with a layover in Chicago.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s feeling the whiskey, the jetlag and the kind of fatigue that can only be generated by hours sitting down on an airplane.  END
BEGIN NOW She stretches by the gate and gets her ticket out.  END
BEGIN NOW Filing past the desk, she hands her ticket to the lady in uniform behind it.  END
BEGIN NOW A barcode is scanned and she walks with everyone else in line to the runway.  END
BEGIN NOW Chapter two.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor Rain, Nor Snow, Nor Sleet, Nor Hash Browns. END
BEGIN NOW The Postal Service has a bad rap.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really know why that is.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, sure, it’s government work, the pay sucks, the hours are long.  END
BEGIN NOW But fuck it, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I walk around for a living.  END
BEGIN NOW Delivering mail is one of those love hate jobs.  END
BEGIN NOW You bring some guy bills to pay, and he hates you.  END
BEGIN NOW You bring people love letters, postcards, refunds, coupons, and Publisher’s Clearing House.  END
BEGIN NOW Those people love you.  END
BEGIN NOW At least they love the mail.  END
BEGIN NOW Being the messenger ain’t that bad.  END
BEGIN NOW The foot work keeps me in reasonable shape.  END
BEGIN NOW I get to meet all aspects of humanity.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t love my job, per se.  END
BEGIN NOW But I sure as shit don’t hate it.  END
BEGIN NOW My route for the past month has been a suburb gig.  END
BEGIN NOW Little boxes kinda shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Well manicured lawns, fresh clean painted houses.  END
BEGIN NOW Dogs in yards, kids in sprinklers.  END
BEGIN NOW  It’s ‘burbsy.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those houses always has something going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Drunk parents, deviant children.  END
BEGIN NOW And this stoner hippie babysitter named Skip.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip basically lives at the place, at least, she’s there all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW The parents don’t really care what the kids get up to, Skip is there to keep them in line.  END
BEGIN NOW Except she watches them with detached amusement and apathy.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip is a horrible babysitter, I’d never let her near my own kids, should they ever be born.  END
BEGIN NOW But damn, she is good company.  END
BEGIN NOW She buys a sack from me at least once a week.  END
BEGIN NOW She knows her weed, too.  END
BEGIN NOW We sit on the couch and smoke bowls, drink beer, watch movies, and stay out of the chaos around us.  END
BEGIN NOW My first day in this neighborhood left me with this impression:  END
BEGIN NOW Skip is standing on the lawn in pajamas, smoking a cigarette, watching a young boy and his older sister chase each other around the yard with butter knives.  END
BEGIN NOW “Bitch! I’m ah kill you!” The little boy shouts.  END
BEGIN NOW He can’t be more than ten years old. END
BEGIN NOW “Shut the fuck up, Stewart!” The older sister taunts him.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s probably twelve or thirteen. END
BEGIN NOW “Eat a dick you dirty whore!” Kids these days.  END
BEGIN NOW They grow up so fast. END
BEGIN NOW Skip is smoking in the background and I’m holding their mail in my hand.  END
BEGIN NOW I walk up to her still holding the mail and pull out a pack of smokes with my other hand.  END
BEGIN NOW I set the mail down and light a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW “Are they always like this?” I ask. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, pretty much.  END
BEGIN NOW Little monsters.” She says it like she’s been asked to watch her neighbor’s dogs. END
BEGIN NOW The front door slams open and a short woman with a mass of curly, tarnished gold hair, a face full of freckles plows by.  END
BEGIN NOW She shouts, END
BEGIN NOW “Skip sweetie, I’m going to work! There’s something edible in the house somewhere, I’m sure you can manage! Also I left you a pack of smokes and a two more beers! I think Dan left some whiskey in the cabinet! I’ll be home at eleven, make sure they brush their teeth tonight, okay?!” END
BEGIN NOW “No prob, Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot!” Skip shouts at her as she drives away. END
BEGIN NOW All I can say is wow. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, it’s pretty much always like this.” Skip says taking a drag. END
BEGIN NOW “Wow,” I repeat.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’m Skip,” she says, holding out her hand with the cigarette sill between her lips. END
BEGIN NOW “Hayden, nice to meet you.”  END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, innit? Wanna come in, burn one?” She asks. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, cool.” I say. END
BEGIN NOW The inside of the house is a shambles.  END
BEGIN NOW Magazines and newspapers in shreds everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Bottles of all shapes and sizes line the counter tops, the stove, the top of the refrigerator, the dining room table.  END
BEGIN NOW There are over flowing ash trays in between some of the bottles, on the floor near the couch, all the chairs.  END
BEGIN NOW All the blinds are down, the TV is on, and the atmosphere is fifty percent smoke, fifty percent dust.  END
BEGIN NOW This is the house that clean forgot.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a foot tall bong on the coffee table, and I’m pretty sure the water hasn’t been changed, ever.  END
BEGIN NOW I produce a small stash box and tell her to pack the first one with this.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a Kush, Sour Diesel blend, all organic indoor.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the finest I’ve grown in months.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes light up a watt or two.  END
BEGIN NOW Which is hard to register with her, since her eyes are almost always half closed.  END
BEGIN NOW She packs a bowl and we smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW The first hit tastes like lemon and pine.  END
BEGIN NOW She coughs a white cloud up and continues for a minute. END
BEGIN NOW “Damn, dude.” She says. END
BEGIN NOW We pass the bong back and forth, coughing and blowing out smoke from our nostrils and mouths.  END
BEGIN NOW  Feeling our eyes water and our throats burn.  END
BEGIN NOW We smoke until the ash is sucked down the stem.  END
BEGIN NOW “Damn, dude.” Is about all she can say.  END
BEGIN NOW This is one hit quit shit.  END
BEGIN NOW But for the true believers, there’s no such thing as just one hit.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re both a bit dumbstruck.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple of couch locked stoners, staring at nothing in particular and deep in thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW The television is playing old cartoons.  END
BEGIN NOW Cats and mice and talking animals.  END
BEGIN NOW Impossible slapstick, and sly subtle sexual suggestions.  END
BEGIN NOW I look at my boots and realize that I’m on the job. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh shit, damn.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got to get back to work.” I say. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh damn, yeah, right.” She pauses.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, can you get more of that stuff?” END
BEGIN NOW “Um, yeah, pretty easily.  END
BEGIN NOW I did grow it.”  END
BEGIN NOW “No shit! Well, huh, got a number or something? Do you deliver?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, yeah, both and.” I write down my name and number.  END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, I’ll see you later?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Definitely.” I march back outside and the kids are nowhere to be seen.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the block was tame in comparison.  END
BEGIN NOW  A few dogs behind fences.  END
BEGIN NOW A few kids riding bikes.  END
BEGIN NOW Suburbs.  END
BEGIN NOW  I hear a small boys voice yelling, END
BEGIN NOW “Stupid fucking cunt!” END
BEGIN NOW All in a day’s work.  END
BEGIN NOW All in a day I walk from house to house, home to home alone in my Postal pedestrianism blues.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey Mister Postman I hear from half a dozen bored housewives in bath robes.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey buddy watch the lawn I hear from a few haggard home body husbands.  END
BEGIN NOW People on front porches drinking in the afternoon sun.  END
BEGIN NOW Old guys watering their yards and plants.  END
BEGIN NOW Cars bring kids home from school and cars taking people away to the city or the nearest shopping center or work.  END
BEGIN NOW  The ebb and flow of the suburbs.  END
BEGIN NOW The wax and wane of neighborhood populations.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 3: The Skillets to Pay the Bills. END
BEGIN NOW Skip is sitting on the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a Wednesday afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW The sky is over cast, normal for early December.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s watching the history channel on mute while listening to Pink Floyd’s Echoes.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s two bong loads and a joint deep.  END
BEGIN NOW Her bloodshot, mint green eyes half peer between strands of tomato saffron hair.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her face is freckled, nose narrow, chin in a smooth angle.  END
BEGIN NOW She has sweat pants and a hooded sweater on.  END
BEGIN NOW And sheep skin slippers on her feet.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip sips a beer and smokes slowly.  END
BEGIN NOW Behind her the children run around. END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck off! You’re a bitch!” Says the boy named Stewart, age nine. END
BEGIN NOW “Nuh-uh! You’re a fag-ass nancy queer homo-gay!” Retorts Julia, age twelve. END
BEGIN NOW “Are not! You dyke-bitch shit fucker!” Stewart is running ahead of Julia.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s chasing him with one of her mother’s used tampons extended in front of her. END
BEGIN NOW “Eat it! Eat the blood of the womb that bore you! Suck the blood from the pussy that pushed you into existence!” END
BEGIN NOW “No! No! No! Not until you eat dad’s dick!”  END
BEGIN NOW “Shhhhh!” Hisses skip from the couch. END
BEGIN NOW The children don’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW They have never listened to anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite pain, despite scars, ambulance rides, yelling, teachers, principals, police, priests, and parents.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone has tried.  END
BEGIN NOW No one has gotten through to them.  END
BEGIN NOW They can laugh anyone off.  END
BEGIN NOW They can fling words at you carelessly.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll call your mother a whore, you father a bastard fag.  END
BEGIN NOW The children will do whatever they want whenever they want.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing holds their attention, there is no fear of consequence.  END
BEGIN NOW  They’ve been arrested for starting fires, selling drugs, stealing cars, breaking and entering, assault and battery of the elderly and identity theft.  END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of terrible things.  END
BEGIN NOW There isn’t a school on the West Coast that will accept them.  END
BEGIN NOW And Skip was the only babysitter that would take the job.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip isn’t afraid to fight back. END
BEGIN NOW The Abbot kids have their moments, but it’s not a constant thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip has learned a few tricks to keep them semi-normal.  END
BEGIN NOW  She hides all the sugar and alcohol in the house.  END
BEGIN NOW All firearms, and sharp objects should be in a safe box, somewhere under the parent’s bed, preferably.  END
BEGIN NOW  There’s a spare room for laundry that locks from the outside.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s suspected that was the main form of child care before she arrived.  END
BEGIN NOW The room is small, just the washer, dryer and a bench.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s always cold in the laundry room, no matter the time of year.  END
BEGIN NOW At first she thought there might be a way to train them by slipping books under the door, or leaving them on the bench.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d come back later to find either the book ripped to shreds, or used as a bludgeoning weapon. END
BEGIN NOW The parents redefine dysfunctional.  END
BEGIN NOW Both are alcoholics and chain smokers.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot manages a call center for voice mail technical support.  END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot is a guidance counselor for the local high school.  END
BEGIN NOW  When they’re not occupied at their jobs, when they are at home, they spend most of the time drinking, fucking, yelling, screaming and fighting.  END
BEGIN NOW The kids carry on as usual.  END
BEGIN NOW Insults fly everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW  However the most that Skip has to endure is the occasional “Fuck off” or “Shut the fuck up, Skip”.  END
BEGIN NOW In general the parents are sweet and kind to her.  END
BEGIN NOW They let her post up on a couch in the garage when she has nowhere else to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t complain when they come home to Skip still in front of the t.v.  END
BEGIN NOW apparently immobile, drunk or stoned or asleep.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as Skip is keeping the kids out of jail, or from killing each other or burning the house down.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as Skip can just keep an eye on things.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is fine. END
BEGIN NOW “Bitch Bitch Bitch!” Stewart has locked himself in the bathroom again. END
BEGIN NOW “Boy if you don’t open up that goddamned door I’m a break it down!” Julia is screaming at him.  END
BEGIN NOW “Stewart I swear to Jesus Christ and Satan God and Buddha and Krishna and Shiva and Allah and Zoroaster and Mormon and Pope Joan! I will piss all over your bed if you don’t open that door right now!” This is how you know Julia is serious.  END
BEGIN NOW She will string along blasphemies in nonsense amalgamations.  END
BEGIN NOW When Julia is pissed off enough to curse all of the gods that come to mind, she will be mad enough to piss all over Stewart’s bed, and his clothes, and anything else in his room.  END
BEGIN NOW “There is no god Jules! I am god! I am Jesus! Jesus wants you to eat twelve dicks for dinner!” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck you and your cross! The real Jesus is watching you right now! He knows that you’re beating off to gay porn in there! He knows that you tried to fuck the neighbor’s cat! The real Jesus knows that you get off listening to mom and dad fuck in the shower!” END
BEGIN NOW “Whatever ho! I get off to watching America’s Next Top Model! I get off to Cheez-It commercials! I just got off in your shampoo bottle, you stupid bitch!” END
BEGIN NOW “You fucking nigger!” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t call me a nigger!” END
BEGIN NOW “Bitch nigger! You ain’t no thug! You ain’t a killer! You ain’t hard!” END
BEGIN NOW “Bitch! Shut yo mouth, ‘fore I come out there and slap you across the face with my dick!” END
BEGIN NOW “Just try it! I dare you just try it! See if I won’t cut off your balls in your sleep!” END
BEGIN NOW “If you cut off my balls I’m going to fuck your ass with a firecracker!” END
BEGIN NOW “You’re such a little bitch! I hate you!” Jules leaves the door after pounding on it one last time.  END
BEGIN NOW She kicks open Stewart’s door, gets up on his mattress and pulls her pants off.  END
BEGIN NOW She squats over his sheets, and his pillow.  END
BEGIN NOW  A stream of piss shoots from her, she bobs her pelvis up and down trying to cover as many surfaces as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW  The door to the bathroom flies open.  END
BEGIN NOW Stewart has been putting on his sister’s make up, which was stolen from her mother.  END
BEGIN NOW He charges into his room and catches his sister mid relief.  END
BEGIN NOW  His mouth is open with anger.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes one look at his makeup job and can’t stop laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW “You look like a whore! Ha Ha!” END
BEGIN NOW “YOU PISSED ON MY BED!” END
BEGIN NOW “I told you I would if you didn’t get out of the fucking bathroom, now look what you made me do!” END
BEGIN NOW “You PISSED on my BED!” END
BEGIN NOW “Maybe now you’ll let me in when I hafta go!” She starts pulling her pants up and he comes after her. END
BEGIN NOW “You stupid fucking cunt! You fucking bitch! Dirty whore! Slutbox fuckstain shitlicking asshole!” END
BEGIN NOW “Stewart looks like a bitch whore! Ha Ha!” Jules is trying to run past him and pull her pants all the way up.  END
BEGIN NOW  She’s hop running toward the door.  END
BEGIN NOW Stewart throws a punch at her face and she ducks, tripping him as he runs at her.  END
BEGIN NOW She hops to the door and down the hall to the living room.  END
BEGIN NOW Stewart screams anger and primal rage bellows from his prepubescent voice box.  END
BEGIN NOW  He pounds on the filth laden carpet with his small boy fists.  END
BEGIN NOW  He gets to his feet and darts into the living room to see Jules still struggling to get her pants up all the way.  END
BEGIN NOW She falls over near the couch and fear coats her eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW She squirms trying to get her pants and feet in order and Stewart descends upon her.  END
BEGIN NOW He kicks her legs and punches at her face and chest.  END
BEGIN NOW Jules is screaming help help and fuck you and get off me and I hate you! END
BEGIN NOW Skip spits beer all over both of them. END
BEGIN NOW “If you little shit suckers don’t shut the fuck up or take it outside or calm down I swear I’m going to fuck you both up so bad your parents won’t recognize you.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll think I replace you with two somehow uglier children.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll be relieved for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW I will have made their day if they think I disposed of you two.  END
BEGIN NOW If you two don’t get your shit in order soon so help me Saint Mark, I’m going to destroy both of you and everything you own.” Skip is the alpha.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip is bigger than both of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip knows where the knives are and she’s not afraid to draw blood. END
BEGIN NOW “Go to your rooms and listen to music or something.” END
BEGIN NOW “I hate you!” Yells Stewart and slams the door behind him. END
BEGIN NOW “Can I go to the store?” asks Jules. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t fucking care as long as you’re not on Cops and you’re home by eight so I can feed you.” END
BEGIN NOW Jules slams the front door open and closed.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip exhales deeply and sinks back into the couch.  END
BEGIN NOW She washes her mouth out with beer.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip relaxes.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a long day at the Abbot circus. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot comes home at midnight, drunk and teetering through the maze of empty bottles in the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW “Hi Skip,” she says. END
BEGIN NOW “Hi Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot.” END
BEGIN NOW “Where are the kids?”  END
BEGIN NOW “Stewart’s in his room, he’s been quiet for a few hours, might be asleep.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fantastic.  END
BEGIN NOW Where’s Julia?” END
BEGIN NOW “I think she’s in the garage, playing with paints.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s nice.  END
BEGIN NOW Any beer left?” END
BEGIN NOW “I think there’s a bottle lying around somewhere.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks dear, will you be sleeping here tonight?” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t know, Penny might swing by and pick me up.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s nice.  END
BEGIN NOW If you need anything I’ll be passed out in my room.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot.” END
BEGIN NOW Mrs.  END
BEGIN NOW Abbot stumbles into her room, leaving a trail of clothes all the way to the door. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 4: Chicken Fried Steaks Are High. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 5: Scrambled. END
BEGIN NOW An off key strain of voice lifts over the fog crusted streets of San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW It belongs to a man bumping into the walls of an alley.  END
BEGIN NOW He holds a bottle brazenly in one hand, taking long slugs from it on occasion.  END
BEGIN NOW He stumbles along, drunkenly ambling to and fro between the buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW o/~ Take me home, country roads, to the place I be-loooong! West Virginia! Mountain Mama! Take me hoooooome, country roooooooooads! o/~ END
BEGIN NOW He pauses to cough.  END
BEGIN NOW John Denver sings on in his head.  END
BEGIN NOW  His head is a lot of hair.  END
BEGIN NOW His nose peers out from between locks of crusty, clumpy rye bread hair.  END
BEGIN NOW His beard is a scrapbook, reaching toward his chest.  END
BEGIN NOW The man decides to take a rest and sits down on a milk crate near the backdoor of a restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW Hands pad pockets in search of his lighter, his rolling papers, and sack of tobacco.  END
BEGIN NOW The tobacco sits in his lap, he pinches just enough to fill a three and a quarter inch Zig-Zag.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones in the orange package.  END
BEGIN NOW From his left breast pocket he produces a well worn, stainless steel Zippo.  END
BEGIN NOW On the surface of the lighter, in brutal etching, letters spell out Chance.  END
BEGIN NOW Chance happens to not only be the name of the Zippo, but also of the man holding it.  END
BEGIN NOW He lights his cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW You know something? Do ya? I know a few things-  Just a few- I don’t really keep track of things too much- My mind’s been a mess lately- no idea why- Where do I live?

BEGIN NOW Chance stumbles along the streets of San Francisco, drinking from his pint of liquor, and shouting at various inanimate objects.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanders around to small eateries asking for fuck ups or spare anything, old anything they want to get rid of.  END
BEGIN NOW He scores two loaves of sourdough bread and a bottle of water.  END
BEGIN NOW Walking along the streets now instead of the alley, he sings the theme from Bonanza complete with guitar noises.  END
BEGIN NOW He sings loudly and unashamed, swinging a free arm while the bread is safe under the other.  END
BEGIN NOW He frees a chunk of bread from the loaf and munch masticates in between sung words.  END
BEGIN NOW The street is a sea of people of all sorts, types and kinds.  END
BEGIN NOW They walk and jostle, hustle and bustle their ways around each other into each other.  END
BEGIN NOW To destinations, accidents, plans, purpose and play.  END
BEGIN NOW They talk on their cell phones weaving an intricate pattern of footwork.  END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 6: The Biscuits and Gravy Train. END
BEGIN NOW Chapter 7: Pigs in a Blanket, Watching Pornography. END
BEGIN NOW Upstairs, inside the projection room at a small theater somewhere off Chinatown, are the figures of two young women.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re exchanging a bottle of wine for a joint.  END
BEGIN NOW  She hands her a bottle, she hands her the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW They continue like this for several minutes until they hot-boxed the room and drained half the bottle of red wine.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re drinking an ’03 Cabernet like water.  END
BEGIN NOW Penny looks at her watch and flicks the projector on to life.  END
BEGIN NOW They sit in two third-hand easy chairs, sinking into the coushins.  END
BEGIN NOW The screen flickers to life and the sound of a bag of chips cracks the silence.  END
BEGIN NOW Penny hands the bag over to Skip.  END
BEGIN NOW Jaws munch crunch potato chips as the static and dust on the film give way to the first showing of the evening.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight is double feature night.  END
BEGIN NOW On the screen a man is driving a nineteen eighties Mercedes Benz convertible down a road that could be anywhere from the central valley to the Nevada Desert to some kind of European country side.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing a pair of oversized aviator sunglasses, recently popularized at the time of the film’s creation by the release of Top Gun.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing a shit eating grin, shoulder length curly blond hair blows around his tanned faced.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing a blue blazer and a red tie.  END
BEGIN NOW His pants are down around his ankles and another mass of blond hair is bouncing up and down on his crotch.  END
BEGIN NOW He holds her head down with one hand, steers with the other and laughs into the open, blue skies.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs the title on screen as his car exits to the left.  END
BEGIN NOW The title comes on in white lettering, reading: Service Station Six: Spermicide.  END
BEGIN NOW Skip can guess where this movie is going.  END
BEGIN NOW “Have you seen this one before?” She asks Penny. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, last weekend.  END
BEGIN NOW And a few other times.” Is the answer. END
BEGIN NOW “So lemme guess.  END
BEGIN NOW The service station is staffed by more big tittied blonds, maybe a brunette, they’re all wearing cut off shorts and barely buttoned short sleeve shirts.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever’s wrong with the car is going to take a while so the man,” END
BEGIN NOW “E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson.” Penny cuts her off, saying the name of royalty.  END
BEGIN NOW “So E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson wanders around this harem slash mechanic shop fucking everything that moves and maybe a few things that don’t. END
BEGIN NOW “Not exactly.” Replies Penny END
BEGIN NOW “Why do you know that guy’s name anyway?” Skip asks looking straight ahead. END
BEGIN NOW “Because E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson is a role model and personal hero of mine.” END
BEGIN NOW On screen Mr.  END
BEGIN NOW Johnson is taking a line of cocaine off the dashboard and laughing again, looking up at the sky. END
BEGIN NOW “Also, his dick is fucking huge.” END
BEGIN NOW The mass of blond hair attached to the head that contains the mouth that was until now sucking E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson’s magnificent member, comes up for air and giggles a little bit, wiping her mouth on her arm.  END
BEGIN NOW Her faces changes from glee to concern then to panic.  END
BEGIN NOW  She begins vomiting profusely, all over E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson, all over the car, into the air, herself, the back seat and the dashboard.  END
BEGIN NOW  Her body deflates like a balloon animal that’s been left in the freezer.  END
BEGIN NOW Now limp and lifeless, her corpse falls back onto the still exposed cock of E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson.  END
BEGIN NOW  He laughs again with twice as much vigor as before.  END
BEGIN NOW  The camera pans over and they drive off screen. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh my god, dude.” Says Skip still not really believing what just happened. END
BEGIN NOW “It gets better, trust me.” Penny has the same look a million mothers get around Christmas time while watching It’s a Wonderful Life for the fiftieth time.  END
BEGIN NOW She takes a long, steady double gulp of the cab. END
BEGIN NOW E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson has not stopped or slowed down his vehicle.  END
BEGIN NOW He has opened the passenger side door and is working on shoving his dearly departed lover’s body to the side of the road while going eighty on a straight stretch of two way.  END
BEGIN NOW He holds the gas down with his left foot, kicking the blond with his right. END
BEGIN NOW “Dude, this is fucking brutal.  END
BEGIN NOW Seriously.” Skip says it distantly. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I know.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only acting, don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s the look for?” END
BEGIN NOW “I thought this place only did regular porn, not sexploitation films.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, a little of both.  END
BEGIN NOW Attendance is down for the regular ol’ porn crowd so we decided to mix it up a little, throw some plot in there.  END
BEGIN NOW More people would rather watch a sexploitation movie in a theater with a bunch of strangers then porn.  END
BEGIN NOW I think it has something to do with the association between hardcore pornography and shame about masturbation, being, typically, a private thing.  END
BEGIN NOW  I don’t know, I haven’t figured it all out yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Someday I’ll conduct a poll about coming here for plot or pussy.” END
BEGIN NOW E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson has successfully kicked the blond out of the car, She was half way for a few frames, dragging along the concrete.  END
BEGIN NOW He laughs his large laugh and drives off camera.  END
BEGIN NOW The screen fades to black and refocuses on a body shop.  END
BEGIN NOW Twin girls wearing oil stained tank tops and Ben Davis blues are waxing a red Porsche.  END
BEGIN NOW Their long, black hair is constantly being flicked out of the way.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s obviously a few degrees cold in the garage, and they’re certainly not wearing anything else.  END
BEGIN NOW A curly red head walks by and makes a mark on a clipboard.  END
BEGIN NOW “You two keep that up, it needs to be spotless before Dr.  END
BEGIN NOW Sherman arrives at noon.” The red head monotones her lines.  END
BEGIN NOW Acting is clearly not her forte. END
BEGIN NOW “Yes Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Fellini.” They sing song in unison, like all twins on camera. END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Fellini walks off screen and the shot changes, suddenly to the front of the shop.  END
BEGIN NOW A large sign reads in Day-Glo bubble lettering Fellini’s Body Shop and Service Station.  END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Fellini stands outside in cut off denim shorts and a blue denim button up work shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s smoking a cigarette when E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson’s Mercedes pulls up, skidding in the gravel.  END
BEGIN NOW He jumps over the door instead of opening it and takes off his ridiculous sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW He grins his post ejaculatory shit eating grin, folds the glasses and slides them into the collar of his shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks over to the smoking girl and starts, END
BEGIN NOW “Hey gorgeous, ‘fraid my ride needs a bit of work.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well man, you’ve come to the right place, we can do anything here, full service.  END
BEGIN NOW Satisfaction guaranteed.” She says in between drags. END
BEGIN NOW “That so? Well, that sounds fantastic.”  END
BEGIN NOW “Any idea what’s wrong with your car?” END
BEGIN NOW “Not a clue, I’m kinda ignorant ‘bout automobiles,” he says grinning a grin. END
BEGIN NOW “Well man, don’tcha worry ‘bout a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW My girls will have her up and running like new in no time at all.” END
BEGIN NOW “No time at all? Well, shucks, I was kinda hoping to have a rest up for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Been on the road since early, got a piss pot around here?” END
BEGIN NOW Ms.  END
BEGIN NOW Fellini motions to an outhouse off to the side.  END
BEGIN NOW  E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson walks over, strutting.  END
BEGIN NOW The shot changes back to the inside of the shop.  END
BEGIN NOW “Vickie! Micki!” The sounds of girls giggling.  END
BEGIN NOW “You girls have work to do! Put that hose down!” END
BEGIN NOW The twins look chided and soaking wet.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, Ms Fellini.” They chime together with a tinge of sadness.  END
BEGIN NOW They frolic off screen in a blur of bouncing breasts and water.  END
BEGIN NOW The twins are toweling off in a room with some wrenches on the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW They peel each other’s clothes off.  END
BEGIN NOW They kiss and dry each other, giggling though out.  END
BEGIN NOW “This is fucking ridiculous,” says Skip, taking a mean slug of wine. END
BEGIN NOW “What do you expect? Most of these films were made with budgets in the thousands.  END
BEGIN NOW The actresses were recruited from strip clubs.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is in this movie because they’re skilled professionals.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re middle class people with either big tits or big dicks.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes both.  END
BEGIN NOW You need to learn how to appreciate camp.” END
BEGIN NOW “I can appreciate camp, sometimes.  END
BEGIN NOW But this, this is just so bad.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, we’re going to have a movie marathon one of these nights.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to flood your tiny, weed rotted brain with so many Russ Meyer movies that you’ll be begging me to take you to a strip club before the month is over.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know about that.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re going to need a lot of dollar bills, and more wine.  END
BEGIN NOW And some weed.” END
BEGIN NOW “We should bring Hayden along, that seems like his kind of thing anyway.” END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno, he’s never mentioned porn or strip clubs or anything along these lines to me.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s because you’re one of the most sexually stunted people I’ve ever met.  END
BEGIN NOW You should fuck him too, it’d be good for you.” END
BEGIN NOW “Fuck Hayden? Are you serious?” END
BEGIN NOW “Totally serious.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s kinda cute, and I think he likes you.  END
BEGIN NOW You two spend enough time together, you might as well be fucking.” END
BEGIN NOW “I think he has a girlfriend.” END
BEGIN NOW “What’s a girlfriend?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well Penny, in typical western cultures, it’s common for a man and a woman to screen each other before marriage.  END
BEGIN NOW This screening period is referred to as dating or courting.  END
BEGIN NOW The persons involved in this ritual call themselves boyfriend and girlfriend.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a title that generally means they are involved in an exclusive relationship, but not always.  END
BEGIN NOW Such as the case of swingers.” END
BEGIN NOW “What’s marriage?” END
BEGIN NOW “Something like slavery but much better financially.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sounds kinda dumb.” END
BEGIN NOW “I know it’s not your thing, but some people like it.” END
BEGIN NOW “Mmm.” END
BEGIN NOW On the screen Vicki and Micki have dried off and put on coveralls with nothing underneath.  END
BEGIN NOW The scene changes to the inside of an outhouse where a young black woman is shitting and reading a copy of Car and Driver.  END
BEGIN NOW  The door opens and E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson’s silhouette stands, arms akimbo, and a mighty laugh rings out.  END
BEGIN NOW He gets in and closes the door behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW “Well hell, what’s your name Honey?” END
BEGIN NOW “Do you mind man? I’m taking a fucking shit here.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t really mind,” he says, unzipping his pants. END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus fucking Christ!” she says with exclamation points. END
BEGIN NOW He says, “Take, eat, this is my body.” As he’s talking he begins pissing all over the girl, the outhouse, and the magazine. END
BEGIN NOW “Drink of this! This is my piss which is shed for the remission of sins!” And he laughs again. END
BEGIN NOW The girl begins squirming around frantically, panicked and claustrophobic.  END
BEGIN NOW Her body doesn’t know how to get away.  END
BEGIN NOW  She squirms her ass around at just the right time to expel loud flatulence and excrement all over E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s still pissing and tries to pressure wash her ass crack.  END
BEGIN NOW He grabs her and works his cock into her shit lubricated asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW He begins thrusting and bucking and jack-hammering her ass.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl is too terrified to scream, too shocked to do anything but shake violently and bite her lips while tears stream from her face. END
BEGIN NOW “Dude! This is fucked up!” Skip is pretty much mortified.  END
BEGIN NOW “What the fuck is wrong with you? How can you actually enjoy this?” END
BEGIN NOW “I dunno, fucked up sense of humor I guess.  END
BEGIN NOW I just blame it on being raised Catholic like everyone else.” Penny pauses to light a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW “I mean, if you can’t appreciate the ridiculousness of a good ol’ fashioned outhouse rape scene with all the scat and water sports you could possibly want, then well, damn.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t appreciate shit.” END
BEGIN NOW “Is anyone actually turned on by this?” END
BEGIN NOW “People are turned on by worse things all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW The human race is a fucked up collective of all the most terrible things you could possible imagine and a few things you don’t dare to.” END
BEGIN NOW “I just don’t get it.  END
BEGIN NOW That girl is so dumb.  END
BEGIN NOW She turned around.  END
BEGIN NOW She had all the time in the world to punch, kick, or bite his junk, but no.  END
BEGIN NOW She panics and turns around and shits on him.” END
BEGIN NOW “See, now you’re starting to get it.  END
BEGIN NOW This is all scripted.  END
BEGIN NOW The most fucked up character in this movie is the writer.  END
BEGIN NOW Writers are all fucked up in the head.  END
BEGIN NOW They have no other outlet for the neurotic, demented and sick things that go on in their heads, so they write it all down.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like therapy for free, I guess.” END
BEGIN NOW The inside of the outhouse has been busted up.  END
BEGIN NOW Magazine pieces, wet with urine, cover the walls.  END
BEGIN NOW Toilet paper, shit, piss, cum, blood, hair and clothing are everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson finishes ejaculating.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl’s ass is covered in sperm.  END
BEGIN NOW It hangs in the air like two frosted chocolate cupcakes protruding from the abdomen of a young black woman in shock.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes are open, her mouth hangs open.  END
BEGIN NOW Her face is battered and bruised from being slammed into the back wall of the outhouse.  END
BEGIN NOW Splinters in her fingers and hands.  END
BEGIN NOW She starts gagging, dry heaving.  END
BEGIN NOW Out of her mouth pours water and bile.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes roll back in her head and she collapses, dead.  END
BEGIN NOW E.  END
BEGIN NOW Norman Johnson says, END
BEGIN NOW “Do this in remembrance of me.” And walks out, strutting back to the garage, giggling to himself.  END

BEGIN NOW Olivia Martinez is Spanish for olive martini.  END
BEGIN NOW Three olives in a martini glass, plate glass window, and a three piece jazz band calling themselves, currently, Penny and the Pinchers, formerly Loose Change.  END
BEGIN NOW Dimer L’Saque taps the skins while Nickels Robeson tickles the ivories.  END
BEGIN NOW Penny Augustine throws her voice into air, bouncing it off the bar stools, the liquor bottles and the patron saint of bottoms up.  END
BEGIN NOW Olivia with olive skin, not green like a Spanish olive, more like a kalamata.  END
BEGIN NOW  With black olive eyes and pimento fingernails.  END
BEGIN NOW This establishment has been named The Stool Pigeon.  END
BEGIN NOW The name is written in big block black lacquer lettering above the entrance.  END
BEGIN NOW  Penny sings her own lyrics.  END
BEGIN NOW She approaches the chorus from an angle, sneaking up on the words sideways. END
BEGIN NOW o/~ We throw stones in trinities pretending they are sticks, pretending they are sticks, pretending they are bones, inscribed, inscribed with runes.  END
BEGIN NOW I am, I am the north wind.  END
BEGIN NOW I am I am the oracle.  END
BEGIN NOW o/~ END
BEGIN NOW Highly regarded as the heaviest jazz band in small circles of eccentrics.  END
BEGIN NOW Penny’s voice is sweet and hypnotic.  END
BEGIN NOW Nickels’ piano work is dark hums and starlight cascades, low pulsing bass note reverberations.  END
BEGIN NOW Dimer’s drums are the love child of Danny Karrie and Elvin Jones.  END
BEGIN NOW Dimer ends his drum solo with a steady progression of minor bass chord progressions from Nickels END
BEGIN NOW o/~ Angels in the grass.  END
BEGIN NOW Angels made of glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Angels made of gas.  END
BEGIN NOW o/~ END
BEGIN NOW Penny ends the song on a low note.  END
BEGIN NOW The audience claps.  END
BEGIN NOW The audience includes Olivia, and a young man with shaggy, dirty blond sandy unkempt hair.  END
BEGIN NOW His face negligent with stubble.  END
BEGIN NOW His right hand is occupied in the holding down of his beer glass while his left bangs on the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW Five stools down a finger nail taps in time with his banging.  END
BEGIN NOW Her fingers are long and slender, just like the rest of her.  END
BEGIN NOW A living hold over from heroin chic.  END
BEGIN NOW A Calvin Klein modeling school dropout.  END
BEGIN NOW She was all Twiggy from the neck up.  END
BEGIN NOW Short brown rooted, blond tipped hair.  END
BEGIN NOW Small piercing green, blue rimmed Scandinavian eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Like two tropical islands caught in a storm named Mary Kay.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s wearing a pomegranate pinot noir halter top and shiny black leather pants.  END
BEGIN NOW She wears her pants like a second skin.  END
BEGIN NOW She stands on five and two thirds inch heels.  END
BEGIN NOW She leans against the bar, showcasing her ass out of habit. END
BEGIN NOW The shaggy blond still has his working clothes on.  END
BEGIN NOW The blue pants with a dark blue stripe down the legs.  END
BEGIN NOW And a postal workers cap next to his beer glass.  END
BEGIN NOW He wears a heavy black denim jacket and brown leather boots.  END
BEGIN NOW His brown eyes follow the curve from heel to calf to ass to back to chest to chin.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s gullible but doesn’t trust the beer’s advice.  END
BEGIN NOW His vision may be playing tricks on him again.  END
BEGIN NOW Beer can only do so much. END
BEGIN NOW “Like what you see?” She has this matter-of-fact Diane Keaton voice. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, sure.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s not to like?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nothing at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I was made to be liked.” END
BEGIN NOW “Were you now?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, oh yes.  END
BEGIN NOW From head to toe I was made to be enjoyable.” She turns facing him.  END
BEGIN NOW “Have you ever been to Brazil?” END
BEGIN NOW “To Brazil? Why I don’t think so, no.” END
BEGIN NOW She walks to the stool next to his, looking straight at him.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits down legs wide. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s very nice there,” She says, crossing her legs. END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll bet.  END
BEGIN NOW Is there fresh coffee there all the time?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nope, but there’s plenty of sugar.” END
BEGIN NOW “I take mine with cream also, thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, Cream isn’t working tonight, otherwise we might be able to work something out.  END
BEGIN NOW I can still take you to Brazil, on the cheap.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know if I can afford to travel right now.” END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty bucks.  END
BEGIN NOW And I can take you to Brazil.  END
BEGIN NOW Grand Tour.” END
BEGIN NOW “Twenty bucks? Are you serious?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well sure, isn’t Brazil worth twenty bucks? Just think of all those sandy white beaches.” END
BEGIN NOW “No, no.  END
BEGIN NOW Wait.  END
BEGIN NOW No, oh man, no no, I just couldn’t.”  END
BEGIN NOW About five silent minutes later, he asks, “just to be sure, we were talking about your vagina, right?” END
BEGIN NOW She sighs and says, “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW We were talking about my vagina.  END
BEGIN NOW And I was trying to sell it to you.  END
BEGIN NOW For twenty bucks.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh, wow.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m kinda new at this.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey Olivia! Beer me?” END
BEGIN NOW Olivia walks over, polishing a glass. END
BEGIN NOW “Watcha need sweetie?” END
BEGIN NOW “A beer.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice big beer.” END
BEGIN NOW “A nice cold PBR for the lady.  END
BEGIN NOW How ‘bout you man? You need anything?” END
BEGIN NOW It takes a few seconds for Olivia to register in his mind. END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll have another of whatever it was I’ve been drinking.” END
BEGIN NOW “Another pitcher of Hamm’s? You got it, man.” END
BEGIN NOW The lady dressed in fruit and wine lets herself relax a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW She spots his postman’s cap. END
BEGIN NOW “Deliver the mail?” She asks him. END
BEGIN NOW “Most of the time, yes,” he answers.  END
BEGIN NOW  “Most of the other times I drink a lot and engage in criminal activity.” END
BEGIN NOW “Doesn’t sound so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW I do a fair amount of drinking and criminal activity myself.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yeah? You got a name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sugar.  END
BEGIN NOW Sugar J.  END
BEGIN NOW Lollipop.” She looks embarrassed.  END
BEGIN NOW “My friends just call me Jay, tho.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sugar Jay.” He smiles real big.  END
BEGIN NOW “That’s quite a name you got there.” END
BEGIN NOW “What about you? You got a name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Hayden.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s it? Just Hayden?” END
BEGIN NOW “Just Hayden.” END
BEGIN NOW “You don’t have a first name and a last name? END
BEGIN NOW “Oh no, I don’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a middle name.” END
BEGIN NOW “You don’t think so? You don’t know?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, I’m going back and forth on the idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe having a last name will come in handy later on, but for now, just Hayden.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, just Hayden…” END
BEGIN NOW Olivia arrives with a pitcher and a pint glass, with a photo perfect half inch of head.  END
BEGIN NOW She tosses her obsidian elbow length hair behind her and sets the beer on the bar top.  END
BEGIN NOW The bar top is scarred, dented and burned.  END
BEGIN NOW The subject of much abuse, spilled drinks, misplaced cigarettes, and all manner of broken things.  END
BEGIN NOW There are five taps of cheap beer and a fine selection of whiskeys, tequilas and vodkas, gins, and mixers.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the last bars on the west coast that still sells cigarettes and pickled eggs.  END
BEGIN NOW The jukebox is leftover from the late sixties, most of the lights have burned out and the music selection hasn’t been changed in over twenty years.  END
BEGIN NOW  The musicians seat themselves in a row next to Sugar.  END
BEGIN NOW “Whatcha guys need?” asks Olivia. END
BEGIN NOW “Hamm’s with whiskey backs,” says Dimer. END
BEGIN NOW “Whiskey with whiskey backs!” says Nickels. END
BEGIN NOW “Scotch and water with three ice cubes,” says Penny. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, alright, I can do that.” And Olivia gets to work.  END
BEGIN NOW Pour, pour Olivia.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole of the bar, shelves, and cabinets are made of wood and glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything in the place is antique, solid construction.  END
BEGIN NOW West End Girl Detectives END
BEGIN NOW The Story should follow the adventures of two girl detectives.  END
BEGIN NOW Two girls that are solving crimes in a END
BEGIN NOW greater metropolitan area.  END
BEGIN NOW It should be noir as fuck.  END
BEGIN NOW Like all grey mists and dark alley ways.  END
BEGIN NOW The story END
BEGIN NOW will start with two girls and eventually they will grow to a team of five.  END
BEGIN NOW They will be tracking down a END
BEGIN NOW murderer.  END
BEGIN NOW The murder will target certain people of privilege.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s start with their office. END
BEGIN NOW The office is one of those low rent spots, a little off downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW It will have a frosted glass window with END
BEGIN NOW heir last names on the door.  END
BEGIN NOW The scene will open with the two of them waiting for a case.  END
BEGIN NOW They will be END
BEGIN NOW sitting around drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes while a lazy overhead fan spins in circles.  END
BEGIN NOW A few END
BEGIN NOW lines of dialogue.  END
BEGIN NOW Some witty banter.  END
BEGIN NOW Witty banter is a must with the girl detectives.  END
BEGIN NOW Their office is on END
BEGIN NOW he west end of town.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s make it the Sunset district of San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t have to call it that END
BEGIN NOW exactly but that’s where it will be.  END
BEGIN NOW The girls need names that are very Maltese Falcon.  END
BEGIN NOW There should END
BEGIN NOW definitely be a murder scene on Sydney Green Street.  END
BEGIN NOW Aka Beach Blanket Babylon Boulevard.  END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW murder will be strangulation.  END
BEGIN NOW The killer will be a composite.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those Kevorkian meets Bundy, END
BEGIN NOW meets Lector types.  END
BEGIN NOW The client will be a rich widow.  END
BEGIN NOW Always suspicious but never at fault.  END
BEGIN NOW She will be END
BEGIN NOW vague and some type of aging beauty.  END
BEGIN NOW She’ll be some kind of flapper girl.  END
BEGIN NOW With a bob haircut and always END
BEGIN NOW wearing an evening gown.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite the time of day.  END
BEGIN NOW She will have a chauffeur that will always be a little END
BEGIN NOW more suspicious.  END
BEGIN NOW But it won’t be him.  END
BEGIN NOW His interests are always in keeping his lady free from harm.  END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW will not trust the girl detectives and they won’t trust him. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we should open with the murder.  END
BEGIN NOW Like in a classic noir film.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s the one, with Bogart? The END
BEGIN NOW other one besides Falcon.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit, it’ll come to me later.  END
BEGIN NOW But like that one.  END
BEGIN NOW With the gun shot and the body END
BEGIN NOW falling and all you see is the hand of the killer.  END
BEGIN NOW The Big Sleep, that’s the one.  END
BEGIN NOW Except it will be a END
BEGIN NOW strangulation like we said earlier.  END
BEGIN NOW The victim will be the window’s sister.  END
BEGIN NOW A younger woman that lost her END
BEGIN NOW way with drugs and sex and gambling.  END
BEGIN NOW She has been out of touch with her sister for many years, having END
BEGIN NOW abandoned her family for the thrill seeking life of the underworld.  END
BEGIN NOW The Underworld will play heavily into END
BEGIN NOW he story.  END
BEGIN NOW Along with crooked cops, snitches, dealers, hookers, bookies, sleazy newspaper men and club END
BEGIN NOW owners. END
BEGIN NOW Now that I’m a little more comfortable in slippers and a flannel, I should be able to write a little easier. END
BEGIN NOW It’s hard to write with cold feet. END
BEGIN NOW We need names for all these people.  END
BEGIN NOW That will come with time.  END
BEGIN NOW The day to start this project snuck up on END
BEGIN NOW me.  END
BEGIN NOW But deadlines are deadlines and the last thing I need is that fat little editor breathing down my neck END
BEGIN NOW about how close I am to being finished and publishers and whatever he always talks about. END
BEGIN NOW If we do this write we could be looking at syndication.  END
BEGIN NOW Like TV and movie options.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s aim high.  END
BEGIN NOW As END
BEGIN NOW long as nothing can distract me for the month we should be in the clear.  END
BEGIN NOW How hard could it be to finish a END
BEGIN NOW story in thirty days? Not that hard, you’ve done it before. END
BEGIN NOW Back on track.  END
BEGIN NOW So we need duality in the first two girls.  END
BEGIN NOW One will be the common sense by the book type. END
BEGIN NOW The other will be the loose cannon.  END
BEGIN NOW The wild card.  END
BEGIN NOW Opposites in a sense.  END
BEGIN NOW But they work well together END
BEGIN NOW and have a decent track record.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough that a big time murder case lands in their laps from a dame that END
BEGIN NOW would rather keep things quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW She doesn’t want this kind of attention on her family sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW Reputation and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW There should be a madam character known as the Razor Clam.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be END
BEGIN NOW many scenes taking place in various bars around San Francisco.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them dark.  END
BEGIN NOW This might require END
BEGIN NOW some research.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve heard of a place called the Hide a Way.  END
BEGIN NOW Or the hide out.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s supposed to be the END
BEGIN NOW darkest bar in town.  END
BEGIN NOW I like that.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll give it a shot.  END
BEGIN NOW Still that opens up the possibility of distraction.  END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW distraction is the last thing we need.  END
BEGIN NOW We need at least one thousand six hundred and sixty six words a END
BEGIN NOW day for 30 days.  END
BEGIN NOW And I know already that I won’t be able to make that on some days.  END
BEGIN NOW Distraction will END
BEGIN NOW come.  END
BEGIN NOW And we have to be ready for it.  END
BEGIN NOW But this time I’m going to make it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to win this one. END
BEGIN NOW So we have our main characters: END
BEGIN NOW Laurel J.  END
BEGIN NOW Piedmont, Girl Detective #1 – Straight Shooter, voice of reason, narrative: Earth – brown END
BEGIN NOW Cha Cha O’Henry, Girl Detective #2 – loose cannon, partner, troublemaker: Fire-red END
BEGIN NOW Juniper M.  END
BEGIN NOW Gladstone, Client – rich widow lady, old pretty flapper, old money END
BEGIN NOW Katherine Bremmer, Girl Detective # 3 – lone wolf, dead partner, guilt, hard boiled, ex cop: Wind-blonde END
BEGIN NOW Lt.  END
BEGIN NOW Addison Sinclair, Police man #1 – vice squad - chastity END
BEGIN NOW Lt.  END
BEGIN NOW Pete Templeton, Police #2 – homicide - diligence END
BEGIN NOW Hayden, Dealer #1 – coke – Envy -Green END
BEGIN NOW Dakota, Hooker#1 –north beach – Lust - Blue END
BEGIN NOW Takira Rise, Girl Detective#4 - ex con, street smarts, semi party girl: Water-Black/Blue END
BEGIN NOW Roscoe, Snitch #1- squealer, works at a pork market in china town – Gluttony - Orange END
BEGIN NOW Anita Fairbanks, Madam- the razor clam, owns a brothel – Pride -Purple END
BEGIN NOW Evelyn Skipper, Girl Detective #5 - the muscle: Heart-strawberry blonde? END
BEGIN NOW Rev.  END
BEGIN NOW Carmichael, The bookie: old Jew: - greed - yellow END
BEGIN NOW Todd, The Junkie: -Sloth, light blue END
BEGIN NOW Mike Armstrong, The Killer: Wrath, Satan, all the sins, Red, END
BEGIN NOW The Victim #1: Mindy M.  END
BEGIN NOW Malatempora END
BEGIN NOW I was watching the ceiling fan as it spun in a lazy orbit.  END
BEGIN NOW The trails of smoke caught in the slow churning END
BEGIN NOW motion.  END
BEGIN NOW The smoke came from my partner.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name was Cha Cha O’Henry.  END
BEGIN NOW She smoked unfiltered END
BEGIN NOW cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW We hadn’t spoken in at least an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t know for sure since our clock had run out of END
BEGIN NOW batteries last month.  END
BEGIN NOW No one bothered to replace it.  END
BEGIN NOW It was either night or day.  END
BEGIN NOW Even that rarely END
BEGIN NOW mattered. END
BEGIN NOW Our office was a simple thing.  END
BEGIN NOW We had one desk between the two of us.  END
BEGIN NOW There were only two chairs. END
BEGIN NOW There was a purpose to this.  END
BEGIN NOW We liked to have one of us walk around the room while the client would END
BEGIN NOW alk.  END
BEGIN NOW Two seated, one standing or walking.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually talking about someone that’s on the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes someone already in the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what we did.  END
BEGIN NOW We listened.  END
BEGIN NOW Then we tried to figure END
BEGIN NOW out the missing pieces.  END
BEGIN NOW Private Investigators.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what they called people like O’Henry and me. END
BEGIN NOW On the desk we had a phone.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those old land line things that no one uses any more.  END
BEGIN NOW The phone END
BEGIN NOW was black.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted a rotary, but O’Henry insisted on getting one with buttons.  END
BEGIN NOW She insists I’m old END
BEGIN NOW fashioned.  END
BEGIN NOW I insist that I have a better sense of aesthetic.  END
BEGIN NOW We also have a lamp and a filing cabinet. END
BEGIN NOW There used to be a plant growing in the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW Turns out plants don’t like watered down liquor as much END
BEGIN NOW as I do in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, I’ve heard that plants like sunshine and fresh air.  END
BEGIN NOW Those can be in short END
BEGIN NOW supply in the office.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose the plant is one murder mystery we’ve solved.  END
BEGIN NOW The mysterious case of END
BEGIN NOW he dead ficus. END
BEGIN NOW The blinds covering the one window we had were thick with dust, ash and neglect.  END
BEGIN NOW Keeping a neat and END
BEGIN NOW idy office seemed silly since there were no clients to speak of.  END
BEGIN NOW Cleaning wasn’t exactly one of O’Henry’s END
BEGIN NOW strong points.  END
BEGIN NOW She was much better and getting to the point.  END
BEGIN NOW She was better at throwing plants out of END
BEGIN NOW windows then watering them.  END
BEGIN NOW She would rather throw the old blinds out too if she wasn’t hungover and END
BEGIN NOW opposed to sunlight right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Even in the dim light of the office she wore her sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW She wore END
BEGIN NOW her sunglasses and smoked her unfiltered cigarettes. END
BEGIN NOW Me? I drank.  END
BEGIN NOW I looked at the fan and drank the two fingers of bourbon we had left after last night.  END
BEGIN NOW I was END
BEGIN NOW aking it slow.  END
BEGIN NOW The chances of getting another bottle on credit from the corner store were getting END
BEGIN NOW slimmer by the hour.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to make this count.  END
BEGIN NOW I needed a little more of last night to make it through END
BEGIN NOW his one.  END
BEGIN NOW If it was night.  END
BEGIN NOW If it wasn’t now, it would be soon enough.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t take my eyes off the fan.  END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW fan and my head had at least one thing in common.  END
BEGIN NOW The slow spinning.  END
BEGIN NOW If the spinning ever stopped, I END
BEGIN NOW might lose my momentum.  END
BEGIN NOW And that would be it. END
BEGIN NOW The day of the week was like the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither one of us cared.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t important.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting for a case END
BEGIN NOW is always draining.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t exactly go door to door.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone commit any good crimes lately? You need END
BEGIN NOW something investigated? Hell, at this point we’d take a divorce case.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, oh hey, let’s follow your END
BEGIN NOW future ex-husband/wife around and see what they get up to.  END
BEGIN NOW The short answer is always: No Good.  END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW follow anyone around for a while and you realize they’re all no good.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess some people call those no END
BEGIN NOW good things vices.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’s why the police force has a vice squad. END
BEGIN NOW The scene is a little place off the main drag.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a theme joint.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those golden age of the west type END
BEGIN NOW places.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a player piano.  END
BEGIN NOW On occasion there’s actually someone playing the piano.  END
BEGIN NOW On good nights END
BEGIN NOW here’s a lady with nice legs singing along.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a series of ceiling fans, driven by belts that swirl away END
BEGIN NOW above the heads of the barflies.  END
BEGIN NOW Seating is limited.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s a place you don’t want to take your mother. END
BEGIN NOW Or your father should you be one of those types. END
BEGIN NOW The boss makes us wear this getup.  END
BEGIN NOW Like black bow ties and black vests with white shirts and our sleeves END
BEGIN NOW rolled up.  END
BEGIN NOW Suspenders optional.  END
BEGIN NOW He says this is a classy place.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to look classy to work behind END
BEGIN NOW his bar.  END
BEGIN NOW I said that’s fine.  END
BEGIN NOW I was done with the dive scene.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather be serving top shelf hard A to those END
BEGIN NOW finance types.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather be tipped by people with a larger paycheck then mine.  END
BEGIN NOW They were also easy END
BEGIN NOW customers.  END
BEGIN NOW Martinis all day.  END
BEGIN NOW Good whiskey, usually served neat.  END
BEGIN NOW The occasional Negroni.  END
BEGIN NOW Basics.  END
BEGIN NOW None END
BEGIN NOW of that vodka Redbull, Adios Motherfucker, Long Island Ice Tea shit.  END
BEGIN NOW These people were serious about END
BEGIN NOW heir booze.  END
BEGIN NOW I liked that.  END
BEGIN NOW I liked serving them.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if they weren’t easy to like as people. END
BEGIN NOW The girl in question.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s always a girl in question.  END
BEGIN NOW But this one I’d seen on a few occasions.  END
BEGIN NOW She was END
BEGIN NOW all class.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the fake, pretending type of class that comes from hard work and moving up the ranks. END
BEGIN NOW The kind of class you have to be raised with.  END
BEGIN NOW Because your parents are professionals and they really END
BEGIN NOW don’t have time to raise kids.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind that has dinner parties where everyone is dressed to the nines END
BEGIN NOW and shows up on time.  END
BEGIN NOW They kind of family that has a coat check in their foyer.  END
BEGIN NOW She had to be one of END
BEGIN NOW hose types.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not something you can learn after a certain age.  END
BEGIN NOW You could tell by the way she carried END
BEGIN NOW herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She walked across a room like the Colossus of Rhodes figure skating for a gold medal.  END
BEGIN NOW She was END
BEGIN NOW one of those types. END
BEGIN NOW “Pernod.” She would say. END
BEGIN NOW That was most of our conversations.  END
BEGIN NOW She would say Pernod, and I would pour it.  END
BEGIN NOW She rarely paid for her END
BEGIN NOW drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always a gentleman accompanying her.  END
BEGIN NOW He would always seem gentle enough.  END
BEGIN NOW But I END
BEGIN NOW know these people.  END
BEGIN NOW They can’t even get a hard on unless it hurts.  END
BEGIN NOW There has to be blindfolds and END
BEGIN NOW handcuffs.  END
BEGIN NOW There has to be hot wax and coarse rope.  END
BEGIN NOW She must have been special.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those girls END
BEGIN NOW hat has a copy of the ‘Thirty under Thirty’ on her nightstand.  END
BEGIN NOW With check marks next to several of the END
BEGIN NOW faces. END
BEGIN NOW I found out through a friend of a friend that her name was Mindy.  END
BEGIN NOW And Mindy makes me think of windy. END
BEGIN NOW And long winded she was not.  END
BEGIN NOW Breezy, maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW She came, she went.  END
BEGIN NOW She was never around for a long END
BEGIN NOW ime.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a two drinks and go kind of person.  END
BEGIN NOW She was around a few times with one guy and gone END
BEGIN NOW for a while then back again with another.  END
BEGIN NOW At least she seemed to like the place.  END
BEGIN NOW If you can show up with END
BEGIN NOW a parade, it can’t be far from home.  END
BEGIN NOW Not so much in a geographical sense.  END
BEGIN NOW More so the conceptual END
BEGIN NOW form. END
BEGIN NOW I may be digressing from my original intent here.  END
BEGIN NOW But bear with me, it’s all relevant. END
BEGIN NOW Last week she shows up with this guy.  END
BEGIN NOW And I’m not one to judge, especially based on looks.  END
BEGIN NOW But we’re END
BEGIN NOW alking not in the same league.  END
BEGIN NOW Ballpark was out of the question.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m fairly certain as to say that they END
BEGIN NOW couldn’t have even been anywhere near the same circles.  END
BEGIN NOW If these two were a Venn diagram, it would be END
BEGIN NOW wo circles on opposite sides of a sphere.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyways, so this couple walks into the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW And I’m back END
BEGIN NOW here, behind it shaking something and pouring it into a martini glass.  END
BEGIN NOW I may have been a Manhattan. END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t sit down, not that there’s a seat empty at the bar, but they stand and wait until END
BEGIN NOW I have a minute to inquire about their choice of libation. END
BEGIN NOW “Pernod,” She says. END
BEGIN NOW “I’ll have a gin and tonic,” He says. END
BEGIN NOW There goes two minutes of my life and they tip six on fourteen.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m ok with that.  END
BEGIN NOW Then I never see either END
BEGIN NOW of them again.  END
BEGIN NOW This is strange since she’s always in here at least once a week. END
BEGIN NOW You can tell a lot about a person by the way they knock on a door.  END
BEGIN NOW Like there’s what the kids these days END
BEGIN NOW call a “cop knock.” Three times, really hard, short bursts of fist on door action.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s the solicitor END
BEGIN NOW knock.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like a friendly neighbor, but one that wants something.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a charitable donation. END
BEGIN NOW Or a moment of your time.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s the concerned neighbor.  END
BEGIN NOW The Angry Neighbor, usually because they END
BEGIN NOW are trying to sleep and you can’t and for some reason it’s not as loud to you in your apartment as it is to END
BEGIN NOW hem in their&#39;s despite all the walls between you.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere in between all of those is the damsel in END
BEGIN NOW distress knock.  END
BEGIN NOW It is all at once: demanding, desperate, diminutive, docile, and devoid of hope.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s hard END
BEGIN NOW o recognize.  END
BEGIN NOW But in this business, recognition is more of a reflex. END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry and I exchange glances like handing off a bag of blow in a subway station.  END
BEGIN NOW We both turn to the END
BEGIN NOW door and wait to make sure it wasn’t some trick of the brain brought on by bourbon and boredom. END
BEGIN NOW We see a silhouette behind the frosted glass window in the door.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that has our names written END
BEGIN NOW backwards from our perspective.  END
BEGIN NOW We wait. END
BEGIN NOW The knock comes again and O’Henry immediately chimes in, “It’s open!” END
BEGIN NOW Through the door enters a woman.  END
BEGIN NOW She was stately.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she was late to a funeral.  END
BEGIN NOW She was wearing END
BEGIN NOW black.  END
BEGIN NOW That helped with the funeral assumptions.  END
BEGIN NOW She also had a veil.  END
BEGIN NOW That further contributed to the END
BEGIN NOW funeral and added an interesting note of mysteriousness to the equation.  END
BEGIN NOW I like that.  END
BEGIN NOW I like mysteries. END
BEGIN NOW “I need your help.” She said. END
BEGIN NOW Her tone had that tinny quality.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she had considered a few other avenues before settling on our END
BEGIN NOW meager office.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she didn’t want to go to the police.  END
BEGIN NOW Or much of anyone for that matter.  END
BEGIN NOW That was END
BEGIN NOW good for both parties.  END
BEGIN NOW We weren’t much of anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW And we certainly weren’t the police.  END
BEGIN NOW We both END
BEGIN NOW nodded for her to continue. END
BEGIN NOW “There’s been a… problem.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s come up recently.” She trailed off just slightly.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she knew there was END
BEGIN NOW more to the story.  END
BEGIN NOW There were details she wasn’t going to let on about.  END
BEGIN NOW That was ok.  END
BEGIN NOW We were END
BEGIN NOW detectives.  END
BEGIN NOW We could figure it out. END
BEGIN NOW “Look lady.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re going to need more detail if you want us on board.  END
BEGIN NOW In fact we’re going to need all the END
BEGIN NOW details.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re going to need all the facts.” O’Henry said. END
BEGIN NOW She was good at blunt.  END
BEGIN NOW That was one of the reasons I kept her around.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I thought about END
BEGIN NOW hings too much.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t think.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a doer.  END
BEGIN NOW She did. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh god it’s just very hard right now.” The lady said.  END
BEGIN NOW She was sitting now in the other chair.  END
BEGIN NOW I was the END
BEGIN NOW sitting one behind the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry was the stander.  END
BEGIN NOW She liked to pace around.  END
BEGIN NOW She was fidgety and END
BEGIN NOW mobile.  END
BEGIN NOW I was saving my energy for times of necessity.  END
BEGIN NOW And I had a drink. END
BEGIN NOW “Cut to the chase lady, we don’t have all day,” said O’Henry. END
BEGIN NOW The key to being a good detective is making people believe that you’re very busy.  END
BEGIN NOW In our case, we were. END
BEGIN NOW We were very busy being hungover.  END
BEGIN NOW Hungover from a long few weeks of waiting for a case to fall in our END
BEGIN NOW laps.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t be eager.  END
BEGIN NOW You have to let the client do that.  END
BEGIN NOW Make them want you.  END
BEGIN NOW That was important. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s my sister.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been missing.” She pulled a rag from her purse.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice rag.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of thing you END
BEGIN NOW wouldn’t normally call a rag, more like a handkerchief.  END
BEGIN NOW She blew her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed unnecessary.  END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW ignored this and waited for her to continue. END
BEGIN NOW “I haven’t seen Mindy in years but I have the feeling that something dreadful has happened to her. END
BEGIN NOW Something I can’t quite fix.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been gone from the family for a while, but her and me.  END
BEGIN NOW We still kept in END
BEGIN NOW ouch in a way.  END
BEGIN NOW We would leave post cards.  END
BEGIN NOW The occasional phone call from the booth.  END
BEGIN NOW That sort of END
BEGIN NOW hing.  END
BEGIN NOW I know she didn’t want to be found and I was ok with that.  END
BEGIN NOW I respected her privacy.  END
BEGIN NOW In a way I END
BEGIN NOW might have envied her life.  END
BEGIN NOW The freedom she took for herself…” she trailed off again.  END
BEGIN NOW Doing that staring END
BEGIN NOW off into space thing that high school students do when they’re forced to do Shakespeare. END
BEGIN NOW “As I said lady, cut to the chase, we don’t have all day.” O’Henry said.  END
BEGIN NOW She was good for lines like that. END
BEGIN NOW “I need you to find my sister.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m afraid there’s some family business that is between the two of us, but I END
BEGIN NOW need to see her in person.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the only way we can resolve this matter.  END
BEGIN NOW Please,” She said, “I beg of END
BEGIN NOW you.” END
BEGIN NOW We exchanged glances.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a well rehearsed gesture.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a way of saying, well, what do you think? END
BEGIN NOW Should we take the case or not? It was a way of tricking the client into believing we weren’t just drunk END
BEGIN NOW jerks with nothing to do.  END
BEGIN NOW It made us feel important.  END
BEGIN NOW It gave the air of professionalism. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright,” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW “We’ll take the case.  END
BEGIN NOW We need to know everything you know.  END
BEGIN NOW Last known address. END
BEGIN NOW Phone number, friends.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything we can to help us.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t just give us a name and expect us to find END
BEGIN NOW her at some restaurant.” END
BEGIN NOW “Her name is Melinda Mary Malatempora.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s my sister.  END
BEGIN NOW If you can find her, there’s a check with five END
BEGIN NOW figures with your names on it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m counting on you.” END
BEGIN NOW “When you knock on the door of O’Henry and Piedmont, lady.  END
BEGIN NOW You get results.” O’Henry did her best END
BEGIN NOW leaning on something and looking confident.  END
BEGIN NOW It worked for me.  END
BEGIN NOW I believed her.  END
BEGIN NOW I may have been high on END
BEGIN NOW a hire and higher on that bourbon.  END
BEGIN NOW It worked for me. END
BEGIN NOW The rich broad left a picture of her sister and a check to get us started.  END
BEGIN NOW That was the usual way.  END
BEGIN NOW We had END
BEGIN NOW a name and a face and a little money to grease the wheels.  END
BEGIN NOW The first wheel we greased was the one on END
BEGIN NOW he corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW The wheel that spun our little rag doll minds on bottles of rye.  END
BEGIN NOW Our little tab was END
BEGIN NOW cleared and a new bottle to celebrate the case.  END
BEGIN NOW In this office we celebrate the opening of a case.  END
BEGIN NOW Or at END
BEGIN NOW least we celebrate getting a check.  END
BEGIN NOW We celebrate traditionally.  END
BEGIN NOW That is to say we celebrate everything END
BEGIN NOW he exact same way.  END
BEGIN NOW We kill a bottle of rye or bourbon at the office and then get investigating. END
BEGIN NOW The little trip outside let us know that the time of day was around three in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW Early.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the END
BEGIN NOW ime I thought it was.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose I should get out more.  END
BEGIN NOW But that might just be my mother talking in my END
BEGIN NOW head.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s saying, “Laurel, you’re a young lady.  END
BEGIN NOW You should get out more.  END
BEGIN NOW Meet a nice man.  END
BEGIN NOW Settle END
BEGIN NOW down.” Mom, you should get off my back.  END
BEGIN NOW I got work to do.  END
BEGIN NOW Men come and go.  END
BEGIN NOW But work lasts a life END
BEGIN NOW ime.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people work so they can live.  END
BEGIN NOW Me? I work so I can die.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, so I can die after I’ve done END
BEGIN NOW something.  END
BEGIN NOW Not like I live to work or anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I live to work on finding out about why people die.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside END
BEGIN NOW from medical things.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s really not my thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I prefer to figure out about when people die because of END
BEGIN NOW other people making them.  END
BEGIN NOW They call that murder in my business.  END
BEGIN NOW They call that murder in most places. END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t want to jump the murder gun just yet.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s start with where the girl could have ended up.  END
BEGIN NOW We END
BEGIN NOW have two contacts in the police department that take us seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW At least, we like to think so.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m END
BEGIN NOW pretty sure they do.  END
BEGIN NOW We haven’t given them all the reasons necessary to not.  END
BEGIN NOW His name was Lieutenant END
BEGIN NOW Sinclair.  END
BEGIN NOW He worked in vice squad.  END
BEGIN NOW If this girl was hooking, he might know her.  END
BEGIN NOW If she was mixed up in END
BEGIN NOW hat racket, she might have turned up.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a good starting point. END
BEGIN NOW We did the good detective thing and finished the bottle as quickly as we good in order to get right down END
BEGIN NOW o work.  END
BEGIN NOW It was around ten in the evening.  END
BEGIN NOW A good start for us.  END
BEGIN NOW We were hot on the trail.  END
BEGIN NOW We had a END
BEGIN NOW starting point.  END
BEGIN NOW That much we knew.  END
BEGIN NOW You could say we were giddy.  END
BEGIN NOW A little excitement.  END
BEGIN NOW A new case.  END
BEGIN NOW You END
BEGIN NOW could also say we were drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW Because that was a certainty. END
BEGIN NOW WE caught a bus to the police station where Sinclair usually worked.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus wasn’t exactly crowded. END
BEGIN NOW Especially around ten o’clock on whatever day this was.  END
BEGIN NOW It was today.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s always today.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus isn’t END
BEGIN NOW oo good a place to do any kind of detecting.  END
BEGIN NOW We tended to keep to ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly we tried to END
BEGIN NOW balance while the bus went up hill and downhill around corners and around and around and O’Henry END
BEGIN NOW was holding onto those very uncomfortable hand hold things they have on busses to keep you from END
BEGIN NOW falling over.  END
BEGIN NOW Falling over was one of those things we were being very cautious about.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not psychic or END
BEGIN NOW anything but in this current state of being it seemed a very real possibility. END
BEGIN NOW After a few minutes that might have been a lot longer we got off the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW The stop wasn’t the one we END
BEGIN NOW wanted but it was going to have to do.  END
BEGIN NOW We were closer but not quite there yet. END
BEGIN NOW “That wasn’t our stop,” O’Henry said. END
BEGIN NOW “You never know when to stop,” I said in reply. END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry started out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW She did that when I was drunk and said things that might have a little END
BEGIN NOW more weight then I intended. END
BEGIN NOW “These bus routes change all the time anyway.” I said, trying to smooth things over again.  END
BEGIN NOW Or at least END
BEGIN NOW blame something else.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t want that cloud hanging over our detective work. END
BEGIN NOW “The city is run by weasels and pranksters.  END
BEGIN NOW Either that or very malicious types that would be better END
BEGIN NOW suited to a life behind bars.” END
BEGIN NOW “Speaking of bars, look what I found.” That’s when I walked into one. END
BEGIN NOW Two girl detectives walk into a bar. END
BEGIN NOW The first one says, “I’ll have a rye and soda.” END
BEGIN NOW The second one says, “I’ll have a rye, neat.” END
BEGIN NOW The bartender says, “That’ll be fourteen dollars.” END
BEGIN NOW The first one takes out a wallet and empties a pile of receipts and old bar tabs and gum and stamps and END
BEGIN NOW notes written on napkins and weird mementos that fit into wallets and finds a few dollar bills folded in END
BEGIN NOW he recesses. END
BEGIN NOW The second one pulls out a twenty from the recently cashed check and hands it over instead.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, END
BEGIN NOW “When we get to the station, let me do the talking.” She sips on her neat rye. END
BEGIN NOW The first one looks at her pile of scrapes on the bar and wonders how she fit all that into her wallet in END
BEGIN NOW he first place.  END
BEGIN NOW She begins putting it all back into place.  END
BEGIN NOW At least she puts it somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW The police station is exactly as I remembered it.  END
BEGIN NOW Very much flourecent lights.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not that different from END
BEGIN NOW he DMV.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot of beige, a lot of hard plastic like grade school.  END
BEGIN NOW The overwhelming fluorescent END
BEGIN NOW overheads.  END
BEGIN NOW No one smiles in a police station.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like the DMV.  END
BEGIN NOW And the lines.  END
BEGIN NOW The lines are just about END
BEGIN NOW he same.  END
BEGIN NOW Except here there are a few more drunks.  END
BEGIN NOW A few more hookers.  END
BEGIN NOW A few more people that are END
BEGIN NOW obviously strung out on dope.  END
BEGIN NOW Lt.  END
BEGIN NOW Sinclair wasn’t anywhere in sight.  END
BEGIN NOW This was hard to piece together END
BEGIN NOW since most of the people in the room seemed to have a twin along for the ride.  END
BEGIN NOW As far as I could tell, he END
BEGIN NOW wasn’t around. END
BEGIN NOW “Leeggo a’ me! I ain’t done nothin’!” Some dame with fishnets on her gams and a two bit halter is END
BEGIN NOW squirming in the arms of some beat cop. END
BEGIN NOW Vice squad and narcotics have excellent job security in this city.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s never a dull moment.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry END
BEGIN NOW and I are slumped against a wall looking around in a haze.  END
BEGIN NOW Like maybe mister lieutenant man will just END
BEGIN NOW come find us.  END
BEGIN NOW Because oh my god is it a mess in here.  END
BEGIN NOW And who in their right minds wanders into a END
BEGIN NOW police station drunk? We must be onto something.  END
BEGIN NOW Only some plan as crazy as this was bound to work END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW A tall broad in a long coat breezes past us. END
BEGIN NOW “Watch where ya standin’ this ain’t a goddamn flower shop.” I don’t catch her face too well.  END
BEGIN NOW I hear END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry say, “Jeez, what a bitch.” END
BEGIN NOW __\ END
BEGIN NOW Aight.  END
BEGIN NOW So this story is getting into dangerous territory with this scene.  END
BEGIN NOW Like we’re dragging.  END
BEGIN NOW We need a END
BEGIN NOW good taxi cab chase soon or some kind of action.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we should just jump to the murder scene and END
BEGIN NOW come back to the girls when the Lt.  END
BEGIN NOW has found them or something.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a steamy sex scene. END
BEGIN NOW __- END
BEGIN NOW “My, this is a lovely place you have here Mr… what was it again?” A tall leggy broad in a black evening END
BEGIN NOW dress is looking out the window at the lights coming from the city like a thousand little bright dots that END
BEGIN NOW really aren’t that far away at all. END
BEGIN NOW “Dwayne.  END
BEGIN NOW You can call me Dwayne.” A large man with a ruggedly handsome face and the build of a END
BEGIN NOW pitbull answers her. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks for such a lovely evening, I haven’t been out of the house in what seems like, forever.” She END
BEGIN NOW spins a twirl in her evening dress that shows off her legs and finishes with a smile that made her END
BEGIN NOW homecoming queen what seemed like a very long time ago. END
BEGIN NOW “I know what you mean.  END
BEGIN NOW More wine Mindy?” Dwayne has already opened another bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW The cork END
BEGIN NOW exiting the glass makes a pop that only a bottle of booze with a neat little cork can make. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yes, thank you.” Mindy sets her glass on the bar and flutters her eye lashes at her pitbull END
BEGIN NOW companion.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets one of the straps on her dress fall off her shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW Dwayne fills her glass a good six ounces.  END
BEGIN NOW She greedily takes a long swig.  END
BEGIN NOW Her teeth gradually becoming END
BEGIN NOW purple with each quaff. END
BEGIN NOW Dwayne loosens his tie.  END
BEGIN NOW He starts to undo the buttons on his jacket, on his vest.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns around and END
BEGIN NOW Mindy is there, closing in.  END
BEGIN NOW She puts a hand on his face and pulls it into hers.  END
BEGIN NOW Their lips lock while her END
BEGIN NOW ongue flicks against his.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hands move around his head and down to his shoulders, pulling his shirt END
BEGIN NOW off.  END
BEGIN NOW She guides his hands to her back and lets him find the zipper.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulls down in a slow, gentle END
BEGIN NOW manner, listening to the teeth of the zipper pull away from each other. END
BEGIN NOW She pushes him against a wall.  END
BEGIN NOW She has him by the throat and smiles in a way that might suggest that END
BEGIN NOW she’s very much in control of the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW She lets her dress fall to the ground, revealing her fully END
BEGIN NOW pushed up breasts, her tight stomach, and her smooth, tan legs.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulls the tie from her hair, letting END
BEGIN NOW he long black length fall over her shoulders.  END
BEGIN NOW She holds him in eye contact, pinning him to the wall with END
BEGIN NOW her gaze.  END
BEGIN NOW She pushes him onto a couch.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a very pushy girl. END
BEGIN NOW She starts at his lips.  END
BEGIN NOW Her lips move to his ear, down to his neck.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hands move across his chest, down END
BEGIN NOW o the hem of his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW She feels his legs and moves to the growing bulge in his pants.  END
BEGIN NOW She strokes him END
BEGIN NOW with her fingertips , kissing his neck, his chest.  END
BEGIN NOW She unfastens his belt and prepares him for takeoff.  END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW slides his pants off from under him and kneels on the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands move from her long, black hair END
BEGIN NOW o her full, perky tits.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a body that made you hungrier with each touch.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a touch that END
BEGIN NOW was like dumping a gallon of heroin right into your brain. END
BEGIN NOW She took his cock in her mouth, just the tip at first.  END
BEGIN NOW Playing circles around it with her tongue.  END
BEGIN NOW She held END
BEGIN NOW his shaft firmly in her hand, guiding it into her mouth, pulling gently at his balls, giving them a little END
BEGIN NOW massage.  END
BEGIN NOW He let out a little gasp.  END
BEGIN NOW A little groan.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulled her head into his dick and felt the back of her END
BEGIN NOW hroat against the tip of his cock. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh god…” he said. END
BEGIN NOW “Mhmmmm.” She said. END
BEGIN NOW She teased and tongued and fondled him for a good five minutes and stood up.  END
BEGIN NOW She dropped her END
BEGIN NOW panties to the ground and felt herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She was wet.  END
BEGIN NOW She was ready.  END
BEGIN NOW She straddled him, holding his cock END
BEGIN NOW against the lips of her pussy until it was guided safely in.  END
BEGIN NOW The plane finally coming into for a landing after END
BEGIN NOW circling the runway. END
BEGIN NOW Her hands where on his shoulders and her breasts were in his face and his penis was in her vagina.  END
BEGIN NOW It END
BEGIN NOW was a very sexy thing.  END
BEGIN NOW You should have been there.  END
BEGIN NOW She rode his cock for a about three minutes when END
BEGIN NOW he grabbed her ass pulled her in close and came.  END
BEGIN NOW All the while saying, “oh god, oh my god I’m coming.” END
BEGIN NOW And Mindy looked down on him and went around the room gathering her clothing from various places END
BEGIN NOW around the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW She found her wine and swished it around in her mouth, washing all the tastes END
BEGIN NOW out. END
BEGIN NOW She was dressed and standing in front of a mirror, fixing her hair.  END
BEGIN NOW Dwayne was still on the couch, half END
BEGIN NOW slumped over.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost asleep. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Dwayne.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW Wake up.” Mindy nudged him until he came back around.  END
BEGIN NOW “Gotta run END
BEGIN NOW buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW That’ll be two hundred.” END
BEGIN NOW Dwayne finds his pants and his wallet and extract two hundred dollars and hands it to her. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks again for the lovely evening,” She kisses him on the forehead and leaves him to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW We finally found Sinclair.  END
BEGIN NOW That is to say, he found us.  END
BEGIN NOW We were still in waiting room, clinging desparatly END
BEGIN NOW o the edges of sobriety when he walked in. END
BEGIN NOW “I had a bad feeling about today.  END
BEGIN NOW Started as soon as I woke up.  END
BEGIN NOW That was my first mistake.” END
BEGIN NOW “You gotta funny way of saying hello, Lieutennet.” O’Henry said, nudging me into consciousness. END
BEGIN NOW “you got some nerve stumbling into headquarters half sauced.” He replied. END
BEGIN NOW “we’re here on official business so lets’ cut to the chase.” I came to in time to find us back in Sinclair’s END
BEGIN NOW office.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as O’Henry slip the picture across the desk.  END
BEGIN NOW “Her name is Mindy Malatempora, you seen END
BEGIN NOW her?” She said. END
BEGIN NOW “I recognize the face.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s been around.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually in for a couple of misdemeanors.  END
BEGIN NOW Who’s got you up END
BEGIN NOW o this?” He said. END
BEGIN NOW “the sister.  END
BEGIN NOW She very concerned about her well being.” END
BEGIN NOW “that so.” Sinclair looked over the photograph. END
BEGIN NOW “Said she needs to see her sister as soon as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Family business.” END
BEGIN NOW “well the family sure knows a few things about trouble, I can tell you that.  END
BEGIN NOW This one tends to hang END
BEGIN NOW around the north side.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually around Chinatown.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve picked her up a few times.  END
BEGIN NOW Always seems to get END
BEGIN NOW out quick.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s got some powerful friends.” END
BEGIN NOW “Powerful friends usually have their fingers in some dirty pies.” O’Henry said. END
BEGIN NOW “Usually.” Said Sinclair. END
BEGIN NOW “let us know if she turns up.” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW It came out of my face a bit quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW Like I had to say something END
BEGIN NOW instead of just wobbling there.  END
BEGIN NOW It probably sounded more like, “Lessus know if she churns up.” But I END
BEGIN NOW wasn’t going to sweat it.  END
BEGIN NOW When you’re a detective you learn not to sweat the small stuff. END
BEGIN NOW I was cautious from the start about distractions but it’s been at least two days since I’ve written and now END
BEGIN NOW I’m drastically behind.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a dire situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the problem was sleep patterns and television. END
BEGIN NOW The other problem was women.  END
BEGIN NOW Women are always a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Problems are usually women and time END
BEGIN NOW management.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s a topic of discussion for another time.  END
BEGIN NOW We really need to move this story along. END
BEGIN NOW We caught a cab from the cop station and made headway to the north side of town.  END
BEGIN NOW This was END
BEGIN NOW borderlands where the Italians and Chinese liked to party.  END
BEGIN NOW There was some grit, there was grime.  END
BEGIN NOW There END
BEGIN NOW was porridge and there was crime.  END
BEGIN NOW There was polenta, which is wop grits.  END
BEGIN NOW And there was congee which END
BEGIN NOW is rice porridge.  END
BEGIN NOW Rice and corn also make fantastic booze if you let them. END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry was looking straight ahead and smoking a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a kind of cool that you couldn’t END
BEGIN NOW buy.  END
BEGIN NOW She had an overwhelming nonchalance that permeated the air around her with an impervious END
BEGIN NOW shield.  END
BEGIN NOW There was only one liquid that could get through to her.  END
BEGIN NOW And that was rye.  END
BEGIN NOW Or occasionally gin. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes sweet vermouth if she was feeling sentimental.  END
BEGIN NOW Or vodka when she was having one of those END
BEGIN NOW nights when she felt old and settled down.  END
BEGIN NOW That didn’t happen often, but those nights seemed longer END
BEGIN NOW han others.  END
BEGIN NOW She wasn’t much for straight wine.  END
BEGIN NOW Said it was too rich for her blood.  END
BEGIN NOW Even cheap wine.  END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW didn’t get it.  END
BEGIN NOW But then again, I’ll drink anything that comes out of a bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a can.  END
BEGIN NOW Or a jug, or a END
BEGIN NOW leather pouch of some kind, or a mason jar, maybe a beaker when the mood is right.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been known END
BEGIN NOW o knock down a couple of vases when the party is getting good.  END
BEGIN NOW Even sometimes I’ll drink out of a mug. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I might even take a shot from a mug.  END
BEGIN NOW A mug shot.  END
BEGIN NOW I started giggling in the back seat of the END
BEGIN NOW cab during my monologue.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a very unprofessional thing to do. END
BEGIN NOW The cabbie wasn’t the best of drivers.  END
BEGIN NOW He kept veering and pulling the cab from one side to the other. END
BEGIN NOW This way and that.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt like I was on a rollercoaster.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry just kept looking straight ahead.  END
BEGIN NOW At END
BEGIN NOW nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW At everything.  END
BEGIN NOW I was feeling left out.  END
BEGIN NOW I kept thinking about drinking again.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t all that END
BEGIN NOW focused.  END
BEGIN NOW And I was the level headed one. END
BEGIN NOW “Whatcha make of it Chach?” I liked to drop the last ‘a’ in O’Henry’s first name when I was drunk. END
BEGIN NOW Chach has a nice ring to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I refer to my vagina as a chach.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll say things to O’Henry like, END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus, my chach is all in bunches today.” Or “my chach could use some fucking attention, I’m all piss END
BEGIN NOW and vinegar.” O’Henry is used to it.  END
BEGIN NOW She just sits there and gives me the sideways eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW That how I END
BEGIN NOW know she likes me.  END
BEGIN NOW When she tolerates my presence. END
BEGIN NOW “Smells like trouble,” O’Henry replied.  END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t like the older sister much and the younger one seems END
BEGIN NOW even worse.” She was the best judge of character I ever met.  END
BEGIN NOW And she hated almost everyone. END
BEGIN NOW “And what does trouble smell like?” I asked, trying to make conversation in order to stay out of my END
BEGIN NOW head. END
BEGIN NOW “You remember that one time you camped the office for three months.  END
BEGIN NOW You had like, maybe another END
BEGIN NOW pair of clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW You tried to tell me the sink in the hall was good enough.  END
BEGIN NOW You tried to tell me that this END
BEGIN NOW was only temporary.  END
BEGIN NOW You told me everything was temporary and this was another thing so it was going END
BEGIN NOW o be alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything ends, you said.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon this will just be a memory.  END
BEGIN NOW Like everything else that ever END
BEGIN NOW happened ever, you said.  END
BEGIN NOW And I sat there with you in the office for three months while you worked out END
BEGIN NOW your shit, smelling like all hell had broken loose within the confines of your oh so personal space.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s END
BEGIN NOW what trouble smells like.  END
BEGIN NOW But you wouldn’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW You acclimated.” She flicked her cigarette butt out END
BEGIN NOW he window.  END
BEGIN NOW It was my turn to stare straight ahead. END
BEGIN NOW “Damn Chach.” That was my clever retort.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you see how fucking clever I was? I’m goddamn amazing END
BEGIN NOW like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Just wait until this story starts getting good END
BEGIN NOW The cab pulled up to the corner of Broadway and Vespucci.  END
BEGIN NOW Where all the strip clubs and whore houses END
BEGIN NOW and great on a budget restaurants and tourist shit holes were at.  END
BEGIN NOW It was all the things you’d think of END
BEGIN NOW when you made it to a place that was a tourist attraction, destination spot and residential area but still END
BEGIN NOW in a city at the same time.  END
BEGIN NOW I love this corner.  END
BEGIN NOW If you could marry a street corner, knowing full well that END
BEGIN NOW he divorce papers were already signed and at a moment’s notice you could drop that shit and walk END
BEGIN NOW away.  END
BEGIN NOW This would be the corner I would marry.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry paid the tab and I asked the cabbie something. END
BEGIN NOW I said, “Where can a classy broad like me get a classier broad at this time of day?” He just looked at me END
BEGIN NOW funny, but not like he was about to tell a joke, more like he was looking at me like he was pretty sure END
BEGIN NOW hat he wanted me out of his cab and he had work to do.  END
BEGIN NOW So he just motioned with his head up the END
BEGIN NOW street in the vague direction.  END
BEGIN NOW I was expecting more.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe life didn’t deliver more because I didn’t END
BEGIN NOW demand it.  END
BEGIN NOW That seemed the way of the world.  END
BEGIN NOW The loudest asshole always gets the most shit. END
BEGIN NOW I got out of the cab and O’Henry was already smoking again.  END
BEGIN NOW She was looking up and down the street END
BEGIN NOW wondering where to start.  END
BEGIN NOW Strip club? Dive bar? Classy bar? Our girl came from a classy family, but that END
BEGIN NOW didn’t mean much.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially after that rap the sister laid on us about how she was all rebellious and END
BEGIN NOW what not.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t expecting her at a classy place.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless her rebellion ran deep in a sense that she was END
BEGIN NOW out to fuck everything of class in some kind of revenge act.  END
BEGIN NOW Like fucking classy people would be like END
BEGIN NOW fucking her past.  END
BEGIN NOW Displaying dominance.  END
BEGIN NOW A strange place that fucking and sex have become.  END
BEGIN NOW Just END
BEGIN NOW another pissing contest.  END
BEGIN NOW Another territorial show, another conquest.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just a party game anymore. END
BEGIN NOW Not just a way to pass the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just affection taken as far as possible physically.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just love, END
BEGIN NOW knowing, intimacy, feeling, creation, destruction, climax, contortion, vibration, melting, melding, END
BEGIN NOW moving.  END
BEGIN NOW Just quite simply divide the legs and conquer.  END
BEGIN NOW Beat your chest afterward.  END
BEGIN NOW Plant your flag on the END
BEGIN NOW moon.  END
BEGIN NOW Armstrong.  END
BEGIN NOW Because that’s how you feel.  END
BEGIN NOW You sexy beast, you. END
BEGIN NOW ____ END
BEGIN NOW I remember back when I believed I was a writer.  END
BEGIN NOW Days and nights spent up late writing and writing.  END
BEGIN NOW Long END
BEGIN NOW afternoons at coffee houses reading and talking with other people that thought themselves writers.  END
BEGIN NOW The END
BEGIN NOW false sense of importance we had.  END
BEGIN NOW The feeling that what we were doing actually mattered to anyone END
BEGIN NOW except us.  END
BEGIN NOW Later in life the wisdom would come that was knowing it doesn’t matter as long as it matters END
BEGIN NOW o you.  END
BEGIN NOW You being I.  END
BEGIN NOW I being the first person singular.  END
BEGIN NOW The only perspective anyone ever really knows.  END
BEGIN NOW All END
BEGIN NOW other perspectives are lies.  END
BEGIN NOW And any writing in them is all lies.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no possible way to actually write END
BEGIN NOW it.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t be honest with yourself thinking you can write that way.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s why I can only END
BEGIN NOW write comedy when I write a female lead.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what that’s like.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t the faintest idea what END
BEGIN NOW it’s like to be a girl.  END
BEGIN NOW But most of my stories are like that.  END
BEGIN NOW Girl stories.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why that is.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t END
BEGIN NOW have a therapist and haven’t been to confession in over a decade.  END
BEGIN NOW I doubt a priest could really help me END
BEGIN NOW with this one either.  END
BEGIN NOW I doubt many people could.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like a dilemma or anything, just a pattern I’ve END
BEGIN NOW noticed.  END
BEGIN NOW I like writing stories from either my perspective, as an idiot stuck in a stupid world, or a girl END
BEGIN NOW stuck in a world of absurdity.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it doesn’t mean anything.  END
BEGIN NOW More than likely it doesn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW I think it END
BEGIN NOW comes from a desire to try and understand things that aren’t me because all the things that are me I END
BEGIN NOW know and I don’t really find them all that interesting, in fact I think I’m pretty damn boring as a person. END
BEGIN NOW I’m mostly useless.  END
BEGIN NOW My emotional capacity is fleeting if anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a repressed (first due to social END
BEGIN NOW stigma/parental influence.  END
BEGIN NOW Then after a period of ‘self improvement’ and ‘personal realization’ I decided END
BEGIN NOW it was best to bury everything as deep as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW ) Self repression.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re all bastards at heart.  END
BEGIN NOW Selfish END
BEGIN NOW bastards with cold black hearts and nothing but personal survival at mind.  END
BEGIN NOW And there’s absolutely END
BEGIN NOW nothing wrong with that.  END
BEGIN NOW But everything and everyone is going to try and make you think that’s a END
BEGIN NOW errible way to look at life.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only realistic.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t rely on a fantasy world in which people actually END
BEGIN NOW care about each other outside of a situation that involves the subtext of “what can you do for me?” END
BEGIN NOW Which is the only question anyone has ever asked ever.  END
BEGIN NOW The words might be different.  END
BEGIN NOW But it all means END
BEGIN NOW he same thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m ok with that.  END
BEGIN NOW Even asking something like, “Are you OK?” that’s just another way of END
BEGIN NOW making sure that that person can do something for you when you need it.  END
BEGIN NOW We are all bastards.  END
BEGIN NOW Each END
BEGIN NOW and every one of us.  END
BEGIN NOW My lease says I’m not allowed to smoke on premises.  END
BEGIN NOW That means my apartment. END
BEGIN NOW But I don’t care right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I have one more and tomorrow is payday.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck the police.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve finally drank END
BEGIN NOW enough to make the feelings go away.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that matters.  END
BEGIN NOW Today was a downer.  END
BEGIN NOW Today I felt low.  END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW don’t like showing it but the pressures and the bullshit have a way of weighing down on you.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought END
BEGIN NOW maybe I didn’t have to be so alone for a minute.  END
BEGIN NOW I know that’s not the case.  END
BEGIN NOW Deep in my heart I know END
BEGIN NOW hat’s what will always be.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll always be alone.  END
BEGIN NOW At a party, in a crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW With someone that spends the END
BEGIN NOW night.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll still wake up alone.  END
BEGIN NOW In body and soul.  END
BEGIN NOW Because ain’t no one getting in there.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I can’t END
BEGIN NOW afford it any more.  END
BEGIN NOW Because who would want to.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m nothing much to want to be with.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not worth a END
BEGIN NOW damn.  END
BEGIN NOW A second glance, another thought.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t matter.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really matter.  END
BEGIN NOW Fertilizer waiting for END
BEGIN NOW my destiny.  END
BEGIN NOW Becoming one with the ground once again.  END
BEGIN NOW But not just the cheap carpet in my apartment. END
BEGIN NOW Becoming worm food.  END
BEGIN NOW Pushing up daises.  END
BEGIN NOW Decomposing.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just composing these stupid symphonies END
BEGIN NOW of silly soliloquies and simple alliteration disguised as brief moments of lucid thoughts woven into words END
BEGIN NOW welcoming wild interpretation.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have been a janitor.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have given up a long time ago.  END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW could have gained more recognition for cleaning bile then writing or cooking or whatever else it is that I END
BEGIN NOW pretend to do.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t matter really.  END
BEGIN NOW Footnote to future Wikipedia article: he thought END
BEGIN NOW some thoughts that he put on paper.  END
BEGIN NOW After his death no one paid much more attention to his work then END
BEGIN NOW when he was alive.  END
BEGIN NOW The spotlight is immensely uncomfortable anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s my own damn fault for END
BEGIN NOW briefly believing that anyone would or could actually care.  END
BEGIN NOW that was my first mistake. END
BEGIN NOW We’re coming into a scene that happens on Beach Blanket Boulevard.  END
BEGIN NOW The scene is simple.  END
BEGIN NOW A woman in END
BEGIN NOW a short, black evening dress exits a cab.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks into an ally.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a man there, in the shadows. END
BEGIN NOW But he’s not a surprise.  END
BEGIN NOW They planned on this meeting. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey baby.  END
BEGIN NOW You got the money?” The man says. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah man, I got it.” The girl says.  END
BEGIN NOW She starts digging around in her purse.  END
BEGIN NOW She starts wondering which END
BEGIN NOW envelope in the envelope in question.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds it.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is ok.  END
BEGIN NOW She hands it over it him.  END
BEGIN NOW He END
BEGIN NOW counts the money.  END
BEGIN NOW He says, END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks baby.” END
BEGIN NOW “No sweat.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll see you in a week.” END
BEGIN NOW She breaths a sigh of relief.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks back out of the ally and up the street and back to her apartment. END
BEGIN NOW She swallows a couple of pills to help her sleep and that’s it for the night. END
BEGIN NOW We get out of the cab and up and down the street is so much neon that I have no idea where to go. END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry grabs my arm.  END
BEGIN NOW She says, “this way, I’m sure of it.” END
BEGIN NOW She drags me all swirly eyed into a club that’s much too intense for me right now.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit down in the END
BEGIN NOW corner.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry handles business.  END
BEGIN NOW She finds a competent looking human being.  END
BEGIN NOW This takes a while.  END
BEGIN NOW She END
BEGIN NOW shows them the picture.  END
BEGIN NOW She says things like, “Have you seen this girl?” followed by questions like END
BEGIN NOW “When and where?” and “Who was she with?” I sit in the corner like an idiot.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight, I’m the idiot.  END
BEGIN NOW I END
BEGIN NOW hear O’Henry raise her voice, which is difficult over the boom boom boom of the sound system.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s END
BEGIN NOW yelling, “Don’t fuck with me.  END
BEGIN NOW This is official business.” I look over and see her shaking a waiter by his END
BEGIN NOW shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks very uncomfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW I would be too.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been there.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry isn’t always nice to me. END
BEGIN NOW Me? I’m laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW Not out loud, really.  END
BEGIN NOW But doing that stifled hand over my mouth laughing.  END
BEGIN NOW Because END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been there too buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW Except this is business.  END
BEGIN NOW And This is Serious.  END
BEGIN NOW O’Henry wrings the guy around END
BEGIN NOW and seems to get a few more details about the girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She walks back to me and grabs my arm. END
BEGIN NOW “We’re leaving.” She says and we leave together.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m still giggling a little bit. END
BEGIN NOW It hits me that I haven’t had a drink in over an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW This confuses and frustrates me.  END
BEGIN NOW But I need to stay END
BEGIN NOW focused.  END
BEGIN NOW “What did you get?” I ask O’Henry. END
BEGIN NOW “Not a lot, but a little more than what we started with.  END
BEGIN NOW Dude I talked to says he saw our girl at a place END
BEGIN NOW called The Motherload rather often.  END
BEGIN NOW Says she liked to take men there on occasion.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t remember END
BEGIN NOW much because he has a drinking problem.  END
BEGIN NOW Some good he was.  END
BEGIN NOW Fucking drunk.” END
BEGIN NOW “Pfft, what an asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW So off to the Mother Lode?” I asked. END
BEGIN NOW “The Motherload, and yes.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s our next destination.  END
BEGIN NOW If that was her regular haunt, we might get a END
BEGIN NOW little more out of goons there.” O’Henry lit another cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW She told me, “tomorrow, I want to go buy END
BEGIN NOW a hat.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think I can finish this case without a good hat.” END
BEGIN NOW I look at O’Henry with her hair all slicked back.  END
BEGIN NOW With her eyebrows all neat and tidy.  END
BEGIN NOW With her END
BEGIN NOW maraschino cherry eyes sitting in her martini glass face.  END
BEGIN NOW I tell her, “It’s about damn time you had a good END
BEGIN NOW hat.” She gives me that look.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that lets me know that she likes me. END
BEGIN NOW We get to the Motherload and the damn place is half empty.  END
BEGIN NOW That is to say the bar is empty but the END
BEGIN NOW surrounding area is all full.  END
BEGIN NOW Like tables full of couples all lovey dovey lock face.  END
BEGIN NOW Lips on lips and END
BEGIN NOW whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit at the bar.  END
BEGIN NOW At least I can stare longingly into the face of the one I love.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that says, END
BEGIN NOW ‘Rye Whiskey 80 proof.’ Four words that melt my heart every time.  END
BEGIN NOW Always a stand up disposition, END
BEGIN NOW never fails me.  END
BEGIN NOW Never disappoints.  END
BEGIN NOW Always exactly what I was expecting.  END
BEGIN NOW Always just what I wanted. END
BEGIN NOW “You seen this girl?” O’Henry asks the bartender. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yeah, all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW But not in the last two weeks or so.” He keeps polishing glasses.  END
BEGIN NOW A thing END
BEGIN NOW bartenders do when there’s no drinks to make.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m trying to motion him down to my side.  END
BEGIN NOW Let him pour END
BEGIN NOW me a cocktail.  END
BEGIN NOW A cocktail minus the bitters, the citrus and the mixer.  END
BEGIN NOW A nice clean pour of straight liquor. END
BEGIN NOW Because I fucking deserve it. END
BEGIN NOW “Do you remember who she was with the last time you saw her? Man or woman? How tall? How END
BEGIN NOW short? Distinguishing features? Anything at all.” The Chach was really giving him the run down.  END
BEGIN NOW I held END
BEGIN NOW up my hand in a gesture of two.  END
BEGIN NOW I held two fingers in the air in hopes that he knew what that meant. END
BEGIN NOW You never knew.  END
BEGIN NOW I was just thirsty at this point.  END
BEGIN NOW I would have taken a scotch and soda as long as it was END
BEGIN NOW drinkable.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as it was liquid.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d take it. END
BEGIN NOW “The guy was kinda odd looking.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, I don’t think those two would belong togheter.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t END
BEGIN NOW imagine it really.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked like a turtle.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked like a fox.  END
BEGIN NOW Not actually like a fox, but like a foxy END
BEGIN NOW lady.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she had that predatory quality.  END
BEGIN NOW If quality was the way you could describe it.  END
BEGIN NOW She seemed END
BEGIN NOW ready to make a kill.  END
BEGIN NOW He seemed ready to be awkward with a girl for the first time in who knows how END
BEGIN NOW long.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t strike me as much of anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that’s what threw me off.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s very interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything else you know?” O’Henry asked. END
BEGIN NOW “Nothing at the moment.  END
BEGIN NOW I only know what I saw.” The bartender said. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks,” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW “you’ve been a great deal of help.  END
BEGIN NOW Also I need a drink.” O’Henry gave me that look END
BEGIN NOW again.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that lets me know that she likes me. END
BEGIN NOW Christ it’s been too long.  END
BEGIN NOW I took something of a break, which is exactly not was I’m supposed to do in this END
BEGIN NOW situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Between two long days off in which I accomplished very little but gained some new cook END
BEGIN NOW books.  END
BEGIN NOW Zero writing tho.  END
BEGIN NOW Blew two whole days.  END
BEGIN NOW And last night I had a house guest.  END
BEGIN NOW An old friend.  END
BEGIN NOW And END
BEGIN NOW not a girl.  END
BEGIN NOW But still.  END
BEGIN NOW No writing.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad distractions.  END
BEGIN NOW I need to get into the habit that I come home, sit down END
BEGIN NOW and write.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m also out of whiskey, that doesn’t help the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW I almost went to the bar tonight. END
BEGIN NOW Katherine was working, which is always tempting.  END
BEGIN NOW If I were given license to start a TV sitcom, I’d do My END
BEGIN NOW Three Katherines.  END
BEGIN NOW It would star Katie Carroll, Kat Su, and Katy Perry.  END
BEGIN NOW A man, a cat, and two women.  END
BEGIN NOW At END
BEGIN NOW least, she purrs like a cat.  END
BEGIN NOW Classic three man team, The Fool, The Leader, and The only Sane Man in the END
BEGIN NOW Room.  END
BEGIN NOW Aka Perry, Su, Carroll.  END
BEGIN NOW Hijinks would include things like Su scheming, Carroll providing reason (to END
BEGIN NOW an extent.), and Perry just screwing up everything like a psychopath.  END
BEGIN NOW I would be entertained.  END
BEGIN NOW I know END
BEGIN NOW hat much.  END
BEGIN NOW In this story it would be like: Laurel, Cha Cha, and Bremmer – who has yet to be introduced. END
BEGIN NOW But soon.  END
BEGIN NOW Time to move the plot lines together.  END
BEGIN NOW Start weaving.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t have to do it like last time END
BEGIN NOW where we were fifty pages deep and no two plot lines crossed.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I was going for that explosive END
BEGIN NOW collision ending.  END
BEGIN NOW This time lets weave as we go.  END
BEGIN NOW We can end the story with a ball of yarn getting END
BEGIN NOW smacked around by a Cat.  END
BEGIN NOW As it were. END
BEGIN NOW Todd: END
BEGIN NOW Today I made a girl cry.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that consumes my thoughts right now.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all that really matters.  END
BEGIN NOW When you break it down.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean really.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the shit that makes you not fall asleep at night.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s shit like making girls cry that keeps you awake. END
BEGIN NOW The thing was, she is, she was aa pretty girl.  END
BEGIN NOW She is, she was the kind of girl that you’d want to ask out on a date or a night or a something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW And I made her cry.  END
BEGIN NOW Not because I was feeling mean or I wanted her to.  END
BEGIN NOW I just did.  END
BEGIN NOW I said the wrong thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I made a bad joke.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t funny.  END
BEGIN NOW No one laughed.  END
BEGIN NOW I said a thing and then I looked at her and she was crying and I felt like and asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW Neither of us could help those things.  END
BEGIN NOW It already happened.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew there was nothing I could say that would make it better.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no way I could make everything ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Words got me in to this mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could get me out.  END
BEGIN NOW Truth is, I actually liked this girl.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought she was a gift to my existence.  END
BEGIN NOW I liked It when she was around, and felt like something was missing when she was not around.  END
BEGIN NOW When she was there in all her understated, don’t mind me, I’m just here and have been glory.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a challenge.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, should I take a chance, should I acknowledge her in a way beyond the work environment kind of way.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t right out say that I thought she was pretty.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t straight up tell her that when it came time to get someone a job, when it was up between her and this guy that didn’t cut the mustard and the boss asks me who to hire and I tell him to hire the girl because she’s nice, doesn’t ask anything from anyone, isn’t a needy bitch and tries so hard to just get what needs to be done, done.  END
BEGIN NOW  I can’t tell her that.  END
BEGIN NOW That might make her think that I like her too much.  END
BEGIN NOW Just because she’s pretty.  END
BEGIN NOW And when I say that I mean, she’s like gorgeous.  END
BEGIN NOW Like the first time you see her, you can’t remember what you where, should be or are supposed to be doing gorgeous.  END
BEGIN NOW And she doesn’t act like she knows it, which is the frustrating part.  END
BEGIN NOW  You figure, she has to know.  END
BEGIN NOW She must have some idea.  END
BEGIN NOW She can’t just wake up every day to that face and not know how she looks and what effect that has on everyone she comes into contact with. END
BEGIN NOW But you never believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW You never will and you can’t because she acts like she has no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW You, and you begin to believe that she doesn’t even know even if, even though you see for yourself the effect she has on everyone she comes into contact with.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s just it.  END
BEGIN NOW There is no solution.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no way to right a wrong of the tongue when all you did was say a thing that meant nothing, thought it meant nothing and then there’s this girl crying and you’re like goddamn.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamn I just did something bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Something unforgiveable.  END
BEGIN NOW A thing that made a pretty girl cry because maybe I don’t have feelings anymore and maybe I don’t really have a sense of humor anymore and nothing is really what it seems to be and it was just a thing that came out of my mouth and I didn’t mean any harm but then there you are all tears and trying to work and I have no idea what to do with you at that point so I can’t do anything and just sort of leave you alone.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how this story begins.  END
BEGIN NOW Because I made a girl cry.  END
BEGIN NOW Because you should know that I’m an asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW We should be straight up about that from the get go.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m an asshole, I make girls cry.  END
BEGIN NOW End of story.  END
BEGIN NOW But let’s get deeper.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s see what else there is to this story.  END
BEGIN NOW I just want you to know what you’re getting into.  END
BEGIN NOW That today I made a girl cry.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe tomorrow I’ll make a girl stab me in the heart.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ll see.  END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow is a few hours away.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything could and will and can happen.  END
BEGIN NOW Short of the long is that I’m a dick and I will be.  END
BEGIN NOW Those who I come into contact will are going to have to deal with that.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be consequences.  END
BEGIN NOW I will deal with those as they come along.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, I’m just fertilizer waiting to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just a corpse that hasn’t had it’s day yet.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just ashes or bones.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just a shell that hasn’t been decomposed just yet.  END
BEGIN NOW But the time will come.  END
BEGIN NOW And when it does, there won’t be any major changes.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another body under ground or in the wind or with a plaque.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows, who cares? Just a memory that will fade, just a person that will slash won’t leave some kind of impact on the rest of anything that contact brings within proximity. END
BEGIN NOW Chester: END
BEGIN NOW I can’t find a way to sleep that lets my crotch breath right.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter which way I turn, be it left or right on my side or my back or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW I start to sweat.  END
BEGIN NOW My bones are aching and my face itches a motherfucker.  END
BEGIN NOW I shift each and every way but none of them make sense.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s night time but from the street light you wouldn’t know it.  END
BEGIN NOW Trucks are passing by.  END
BEGIN NOW Making late night slash early morning deliveries.  END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Furniture and FedEx packages.  END
BEGIN NOW Lamps and desks and letters from home and to home and big envelopes full of promise.  END
BEGIN NOW And I can’t sleep a wink.  END
BEGIN NOW I won’t sleep tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m trying to sleep with no clothes tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW The air is hot inside and too cold outside like if I crack a window open it will be too great a shift.  END
BEGIN NOW Too cold that would cut threw the blankets and the sheets and even the beard on my face couldn’t stop the cold air from hitting right where it hurts. END
BEGIN NOW I toss again and turn around and lay spread eagle with half a blanket on me.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it doesn’t matter too much.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m all out of dreams to look forward to when sleep would finally grace me with the sweet relief of rest.  END
BEGIN NOW So I lay out stretched and open and covered in a thin layer of my own sweat.  END
BEGIN NOW Wondering what time it is and wishing it was a time that it couldn’t be.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure if it was the past or the present that I’d rather be in.  END
BEGIN NOW The past was tainted with a veneer of blurred memories where the bad is forgotten and the good is left behind leaving a only a shadow of truth and figure of lies that I found rather soothing. END
BEGIN NOW What I wouldn’t give to just stop thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW If I could only stop thinking for a while and just sleep a dreamless, thoughtless easy sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind that drinkers and junkies sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW I crave peace and rest and anything. END
BEGIN NOW My apartment is a one bedroom thing.  END
BEGIN NOW In a complex with some thirty other units and this fat lady with all the keys.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of fat lady that always wears dresses because pants would just let everyone know the obviousness of her obesity.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a bitchy face and was always worse when you had to hand over the rent check and she has this pair of glasses, the kind on a chain around her neck that she only put on for reading the rent checks.  END
BEGIN NOW And she looks over the check with the glasses on the edge of her nose.  END
BEGIN NOW And all you can really think about is choking her with those damned glasses of hers.  END
BEGIN NOW The nice thing about the apartment is that there’s a pool.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t like swimming, but having the pool around is nice.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s no good for me.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really hang around it or anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m kind of a work from home type.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those envelope stuffers you always hear about.  END
BEGIN NOW  The work is simple and I don’t have to leave the house much.  END
BEGIN NOW It works out.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside my apartment are too many things that I can’t really, don’t want to and probably shouldn’t deal with. END
BEGIN NOW Petra: END
BEGIN NOW My bike has a flat tire.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now, at this moment I’m sitting on a sidewalk with a bike with a flat tire.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t ask for this.  END
BEGIN NOW And believe you me I want nothing to do with a flat tire or a bike or the sidewalk.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m fifteen minutes late for a job interview and at this point I might as well phone it in.  END
BEGIN NOW The job is one of those classified ad answering things where I lost one job because they couldn’t pay and stopped paying me and didn’t bother telling me until the pay check was supposed to come and they told me just to wait a few more days.  END
BEGIN NOW The classified ad was looking for someone that could work odd hours and weedends and had no problem with deadlines and stress and cramped work environments.  END
BEGIN NOW I was like sure.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do that.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m all over it.  END
BEGIN NOW I called them up and schedule a time where we could sit down and talk about how awesome I will be at this job.  END
BEGIN NOW I brush the hair off my face and look at my flat tire and kick it.  END
BEGIN NOW I swear at my bike and keep sitting down.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s time to call in.  END
BEGIN NOW to say oh, damn my bike done fucked up my timing.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sorry about that can we reschedule? I really would like the oppourtunity to work here at this whatever is that you do at this place job.  END
BEGIN NOW But I assure you that I’m the girl for the job and I’m sure that I can do everything you want and more and we’ll both be happy and better off so please give me another chance.  END
BEGIN NOW I pick up the phone and call and wait and the phone rings in some office somewhere or maybe it’s a warehouse.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t rightly know.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really care.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be a job, it’ll be new.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be people there I like and people I don’t like and goddamn it please pick up the fucking phone. END
BEGIN NOW Ring ring.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Ring ring. END
BEGIN NOW You’ve got to be kidding me.  END
BEGIN NOW No voicemail, no answering machine.  END
BEGIN NOW No nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m twenty minutes late now and I’m like fuck it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll show up, knock on the door until I talk to someone and I’ll be so charming that they’ll take me right in.  END
BEGIN NOW I make a logical decision and lock my flat tire bike up next to the bus stop and wait for the next bus downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW Todd: END
BEGIN NOW I went to work today and everything was different.  END
BEGIN NOW The crying girl called in sick.  END
BEGIN NOW She wasn’t around.  END
BEGIN NOW I went through the motions.  END
BEGIN NOW I did my job.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything just sort of happened and I wasn’t really there to do anything about it.  END
BEGIN NOW I let it happen.  END
BEGIN NOW It happened around me.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like when you come home after a trip on an airplane.  END
BEGIN NOW I was half asleep in a little metal box with wings and then I was somewhere else for a while and then I was back home and it seemed like nothing really changed but time passed by without me.  END
BEGIN NOW At the end of the day the manager called me into his office.  END
BEGIN NOW The manager was a fat man, middle aged, the kind that wears a tie even on his day off.  END
BEGIN NOW His tie was always different.  END
BEGIN NOW He had glasses and a managerial mustache.  END
BEGIN NOW I imagined that he thought himself very much in authority.  END
BEGIN NOW He was sitting at his desk.  END
BEGIN NOW He was always sitting at his desk.  END
BEGIN NOW He says, Todd, have a seat.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit down.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m wearing my work uniform with its polo shirt and nondescript black pants.  END
BEGIN NOW The manager, let’s call him Robert.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s sitting looking at me like I know why he called me in here.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s fidgeting with a pencil.  END
BEGIN NOW I never liked pencils.  END
BEGIN NOW Too easy to erase. END
BEGIN NOW Robert he says, Todd, I think I know why I called you in here.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m like, no sir.  END
BEGIN NOW No idea. END
BEGIN NOW Robert says, Lisa called in sick today.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you know why she called in sick, Todd? END
BEGIN NOW No sir, I do not.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no idea. END
BEGIN NOW Robert says, she said she wasn’t feeling well.  END
BEGIN NOW Any idea why she wasn’t feeling well? END
BEGIN NOW No sir, no idea. END
BEGIN NOW Robert fidgets with his tie, he doesn’t look me in the eye much.  END
BEGIN NOW Like this is just as unpleasant for him.  END
BEGIN NOW Just as uncomfortable.  END
BEGIN NOW  Robert says, I saw you two talking yesterday before closing.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked like she was crying.  END
BEGIN NOW Did you say something that would make her cry Todd? END
BEGIN NOW Sir, she just started crying.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why.  END
BEGIN NOW I say it like crying is just what Lisa does.  END
BEGIN NOW Lisa is a crier.  END
BEGIN NOW Could have been anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe her pet hamster died or something.  END
BEGIN NOW No my fault. END
BEGIN NOW Robert taps his pencil on his tie and says, ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Ok I guess we’re done here.  END
BEGIN NOW Have a nice weekend Todd. END
BEGIN NOW You too sir.  END
BEGIN NOW I get up and leave the office.  END
BEGIN NOW I grab my bag with a book and a sweater in it and go to the train station.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to go home and heat up some food and watch TV and forget about work for two days. END
BEGIN NOW Chester: END
BEGIN NOW There was an ad in the classifieds.  END
BEGIN NOW It says: Trouble Sleeping? Do you have insomnia? Enroll in sleep study, earn up to 100$.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m like sweet.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds about right.  END
BEGIN NOW The study takes place at this psychology lab up on the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW I make the phone call and they ask me some questions.  END
BEGIN NOW I answer everything like damn, I can’t fucking sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Please help me.  END
BEGIN NOW And they’re like, we’ll call you back and let you know.  END
BEGIN NOW I tried napping on the couch this afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW The sun somehow made it past the blinds and into the house and on my face and I was tossing and turning on the couch and had a little white noise and everything and even tried warm milk and was lying on my face for what must have been hours but probably wasn’t when the phone rang.  END
BEGIN NOW I picked up the phone and there’s a woman on the other end of the line and she’s like is this Chester and I’m like yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW She asks if I can stop by the lab for a second interview.  END
BEGIN NOW She wants to meet tomorrow around two in the after noon.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do that.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m all about it.  END
BEGIN NOW I say yes.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll be there at two.  END
BEGIN NOW She says if I don’t mind, I’ll have to sleep in the lab for a few nights.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s cool.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no other obligations.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing to explain to no one.  END
BEGIN NOW I sit at the kitchen table.  END
BEGIN NOW One of those folding lawn furniture for playing cards or improtu barbeques kind of deals.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a stack of empty envelopes on my left and a stack of full envelopes on my right.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a pile of paper that needs to go into the envelopes in front of me.  END
BEGIN NOW And a pot of coffee that I drink out of.  END
BEGIN NOW I fold in silence.  END
BEGIN NOW Delicately placing each piece of paper in each envelope and sealing it with a piece of moist sponge I keep on hand for just such purposes.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m thinking about tomorrow at two.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m thinking about nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW Curling and Me. END
BEGIN NOW Something strange happened to me in February from the 16th to the 26th of two thousand and ten.  END
BEGIN NOW It started right when the Olympics did.  END
BEGIN NOW It started, really four years ago when I happened upon the game of curling.  END
BEGIN NOW Specifically, women’s curling.  END
BEGIN NOW Color me captivated.  END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere in between shuffleboard and chess on ice.  END
BEGIN NOW I watched it for hours.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d watch women from around the world throw forty-four pound granite rocks at concentric circles on the other end of a hundred and fifty foot long sheet of ice.  END
BEGIN NOW There was something very zen about the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW The click of the rocks, the skip screaming her heart out at the sweepers.  END
BEGIN NOW The roar of the crowd after a good draw, a nice chip and roll.  END
BEGIN NOW When the stone sneaks in the hole, into the house and lands right on the button.  END
BEGIN NOW And the crowd goes crazy.  END
BEGIN NOW For two weeks in February I was obsessed.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d check the scores on every game day.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d watch every chance I could, in bars, at home on the computer.  END
BEGIN NOW Each game came curling into my home in the wee hours of night as I’d lie in bed, my legs sore and immobile from working for twelve hours a day.  END
BEGIN NOW  Curling was rest.  END
BEGIN NOW Curling was meditation.  END
BEGIN NOW Curling was a grand game with a lot of pretty faces. END
BEGIN NOW I was helping a restaurant open at the time.  END
BEGIN NOW About two months into the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I was something like third in command of a kitchen that was as serious as it was ridiculous.  END
BEGIN NOW Absurd as it was beautiful .  END
BEGIN NOW As awkward and quirky and disgusting and elegant as a kitchen can be.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole thing hurt my brain and my spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW It was crippling me quickly and I could feel my soul and body being beaten with celery stalks, pelted with onions, crippled with carrots.  END
BEGIN NOW In short, I was tired.  END
BEGIN NOW I was tired all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW I could think and move only on autopilot.  END
BEGIN NOW I was trying my hardest.  END
BEGIN NOW I was working unpaid four hours a day.  END
BEGIN NOW I gave everything my best and my best never seemed good enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost daily the chef would take me outside to talk.  END
BEGIN NOW These were usually two to five minute conversations in which I got in maybe two words edgewise and would have been better off just nodding and agreeing.  END
BEGIN NOW My vocabulary was trimmed down to “yes” and “I understand”. END
BEGIN NOW I got off work that day around twelve thirty in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW There was about an hour left of good drinking time.  END
BEGIN NOW I went straight to the bar on a Wednesday night and sat alone with three to four stools free on either side of me.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartenders were all girls.  END
BEGIN NOW I liked this bar.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a nice place to drink bourbon on a Wednesday night.  END
BEGIN NOW On the TV in the corner, the curling continued.  END
BEGIN NOW The match was Great Britain versus the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW This was the game that changed me.  END
BEGIN NOW This was the moment where I lost touch with reality, sanity and common sense.  END
BEGIN NOW The skip for Great Britain was nineteen years old.  END
BEGIN NOW Youngest skip ever at the Olympics.  END
BEGIN NOW She was fit.  END
BEGIN NOW She was pretty.  END
BEGIN NOW She had won the juniors for the last three years in a row.  END
BEGIN NOW Her name is Eve Muirhead.  END
BEGIN NOW If anything, she was the final stone in my house.  END
BEGIN NOW The hammer that nailed me.  END
BEGIN NOW She could skip my rocks any day.  END
BEGIN NOW If anything it was her contagious passion for the game that took my about the neck, dragged me over the hog line and swept me off my feet.  END
BEGIN NOW The girl could scream.  END
BEGIN NOW The way she yelled at the stone, at the sweepers.  END
BEGIN NOW Just screaming her heart out.  END
BEGIN NOW Always going, “HARD! REALLY HARD!” It was all a bit overwhelming.  END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey and the bar and the curling and the barmaids that spoke about starting their own little curling team.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t believe they were serious.  END
BEGIN NOW They said it seemed like a good game to play while drinking. END
BEGIN NOW “If anything comes back off the grill tonight, I’m moving to Vancouver before tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW I won’t be coming to work anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I think I’ll get a job driving the Zamboni around after hours.  END
BEGIN NOW Practice some curling between the hours of two and four in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW That sounds nice.” I was sweating proufously and grilling a few hamburgers.  END
BEGIN NOW The sous chef was looking at me with a raised eyebrow.  END
BEGIN NOW She stood short with her hair in a tight bun on the back of her head.  END
BEGIN NOW She always looked at me like she wanted me to shut up.  END
BEGIN NOW I always looked at her as if I knew nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW We had a healthy relationship. END
BEGIN NOW The day was February 23rd.  END
BEGIN NOW It was to be a great day for curling.  END
BEGIN NOW It was rather a day of heartbreak.  END
BEGIN NOW A rather good day for a heartbreak.  END
BEGIN NOW I checked my phone every half hour.  END
BEGIN NOW Checking scores.  END
BEGIN NOW Seeing how the girls were doing.  END
BEGIN NOW I was secretly rooting for the UK.  END
BEGIN NOW I know it was treasonous.  END
BEGIN NOW I know it was wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW But I couldn’t help it.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a soft spot for prodigies.  END
BEGIN NOW  For a hard working nineteen year old commanding a team of women twice her age.  END
BEGIN NOW I heard she plays bagpipes too.  END
BEGIN NOW A real up and comer.  END
BEGIN NOW  A kid defending Scotland, the very country and invented the game, going head to head with Canada, the country that took curling very seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW Heartbreak came in the form of Cheryl Bernard, the Canadian skip.  END
BEGIN NOW She had the look of an old school mate’s mom.  END
BEGIN NOW Like when you go over to a friend’s house after class and you meet his or her mother and they just happened to have a plate of still warm cookies.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe she was the kind of mom that had milk in a pitcher in the fridge.  END
BEGIN NOW Except that she was Canadian, and they keep their milk in bags. END
BEGIN NOW Concurrently, there was a game between the United States and China.  END
BEGIN NOW This was China’s first time curling at the Olympics.  END
BEGIN NOW They had been training on Canadian soil, over in Alberta.  END
BEGIN NOW Their training must have been extensive.  END
BEGIN NOW They attacked with a kind of technical precision that was borderline evil.  END
BEGIN NOW Calculated and calm, cool and collected.  END
BEGIN NOW I checked the scores.  END
BEGIN NOW Both games tied at 5.  END
BEGIN NOW The tension was slow murder.  END
BEGIN NOW Like being crushed by stone after stone, lowered slowly on your chest until the weight made breathing unbearable.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have been there.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have been in Vancouver shouting my support from the stands.  END
BEGIN NOW Both games went an extra end.  END
BEGIN NOW Both games the teams I rooted for took a beating in the last end.  END
BEGIN NOW And like that, they were out of the running. END
BEGIN NOW “I need more out of you,” he said.  END
BEGIN NOW “I know you’re trying fucking hard and you’re doing a good fucking job.  END
BEGIN NOW But I need more.  END
BEGIN NOW You need to step up in a big way.  END
BEGIN NOW Real fucking type A personality.  END
BEGIN NOW Get in people’s faces when you see something wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW You need to be a fucking man.  END
BEGIN NOW No more of this pussy shit.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes,” I said.  END
BEGIN NOW “I understand.” I said. END
BEGIN NOW The chef was mad at me again.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know if it was madness or anger or frustration or what.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like I couldn’t do anything right enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Like there was always something not as good as it could be.  END
BEGIN NOW Like no matter what I did, he didn’t like it.  END
BEGIN NOW He was impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW I was impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW The job was impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW And it had to be done.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to do it.  END
BEGIN NOW All I could do was keep going.  END
BEGIN NOW Forward momentum.  END
BEGIN NOW I needed a sweeper to slick the ice, to keep me going.  END
BEGIN NOW Inch me right into the house.  END
BEGIN NOW I needed to get on the goddamn button.  END
BEGIN NOW But there was always something.  END
BEGIN NOW I took a lot of heat.  END
BEGIN NOW I took a lot of abuse.  END
BEGIN NOW And in my head and my thoughts all I could think about was the semi finals coming up.  END
BEGIN NOW Canada vs.  END
BEGIN NOW Switzerland, China at Sweden.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweden? I hadn’t even noticed Sweden.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t know what the world was up against.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t count on Anette Norberg.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think anyone did.  END
BEGIN NOW Except maybe Cheryl Bernard. END
BEGIN NOW After hearing about Sweden’s victory over China, my mind went for another loop.  END
BEGIN NOW I figured China was going to steal this one for sure.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed like it was going to be China on Canada for the gold.  END
BEGIN NOW Switzerland played well enough, but not consistently enough to be seriously considered.  END
BEGIN NOW Even so.  END
BEGIN NOW These were going to be nail-biters.  END
BEGIN NOW Just about as brutal as curling can be.  END
BEGIN NOW And there I was, stuck at work.  END
BEGIN NOW Cut off from everything that mattered.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything that mattered happened in the semis.  END
BEGIN NOW  The semi final games showed the world how cold blooded Norberg was.  END
BEGIN NOW How ruthless and relentless.  END
BEGIN NOW All the effort in China couldn’t stop her.  END
BEGIN NOW Bernard walked all over Switzerland in her fancy curling shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW She did a little tap dance at the end.  END
BEGIN NOW A little victory dance.  END
BEGIN NOW  A little premature.  END
BEGIN NOW I was at something stupid like seventy-five hours that week.  END
BEGIN NOW I was looking forward to tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW The gold medal game.  END
BEGIN NOW Canada vs.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweden.  END
BEGIN NOW I had the day off.  END
BEGIN NOW I was going to wake up at nine to watch China pummel Switzerland back into neutrality.  END
BEGIN NOW Take a nap and catch the three p.m.  END
BEGIN NOW gold game.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there was a disaster.  END
BEGIN NOW The sous chef called in sick.  END
BEGIN NOW An insult.  END
BEGIN NOW A disappointment.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t call in sick.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t call in sick.  END
BEGIN NOW Not on gold medal day.  END
BEGIN NOW There I was, the only one that could fill her spot.  END
BEGIN NOW  I had to take the hit.  END
BEGIN NOW Go an extra end.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s another eight hours, anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure I could catch the game later.  END
BEGIN NOW I went to the restroom and checked the scores.  END
BEGIN NOW Canada 2, Sweden 4.  END
BEGIN NOW Canada 6, Sweden 4.  END
BEGIN NOW Sweden 6, Canada 6.  END
BEGIN NOW Extra end.  END
BEGIN NOW Going into the 11th end.  END
BEGIN NOW I was on my god only knows cup of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW My hands were shaking, my palms were sweating.  END
BEGIN NOW I had a handful of tickets and a table full of plates. END
BEGIN NOW “You! Go to 203 with the chicken and the kale, positions one and two.” I handed off two plates and three more hit the table.  END
BEGIN NOW I was expediting two hundred and thirty people’s worth of food in a five hour stretch.  END
BEGIN NOW My eyes had enough bags under them to pack for two weeks in Vancouver.  END
BEGIN NOW “Runner! I need a runner!” The ticket machine kept printing.  END
BEGIN NOW I looked at it the same way Eve Muirhead looked at Cheryl Bernard in the tenth.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, why are you doing this to me? Like, why now? Why like this? I’m sure there’s a better way.  END
BEGIN NOW I got off work much later.  END
BEGIN NOW Something around midnight.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like too little too late.  END
BEGIN NOW I checked the scores again.  END
BEGIN NOW Swedish victory, 7-6.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure I wished defeat on Canada for crushing the Brits.  END
BEGIN NOW But still I felt nothing but sour about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Curling is a game of defeat.  END
BEGIN NOW The sweet taste of agony.  END
BEGIN NOW The struggle of futility.  END
BEGIN NOW Curling was something like a great metaphor for life in February.  END
BEGIN NOW  For all my efforts in vain, for all the efforts of the curling teams.  END
BEGIN NOW For all the underdogs that took a bullet.  END
BEGIN NOW To them I raised my bourbon glass and saluted the screen.  END
BEGIN NOW I watched the gold medal game over and over.  END
BEGIN NOW The tenth end is like watching a slow motion punch in the face.  END
BEGIN NOW The hammer in the eleventh is the stone that breaks hearts.  END
BEGIN NOW None of it really mattered anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW It had become a necessary part of me.  END
BEGIN NOW A cancerous, out of control mutation in my brain that helped me disregard everything else in life.  END
BEGIN NOW My affection for that game was like that of an ex-lover.  END
BEGIN NOW You think of them sometimes and feel something you’d rather not try to describe.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know where I’m going with this anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t understand what to do with my life.  END
BEGIN NOW The Junior Championships started today.  END
BEGIN NOW The women’s championships starts on the 20th.  END
BEGIN NOW All I know is that it’s just beginning.  END
BEGIN NOW And the worst is far from over.  END
BEGIN NOW   END
BEGIN NOW Part 2: The Chinchilla. END
BEGIN NOW Her name was Nikki.  END
BEGIN NOW We worked together for a good two weeks before she introduced herself.  END
BEGIN NOW She said, “Hi, I’m Nikki.” and I said, “Hi, I’m Nick.”  END
BEGIN NOW “That should be easy to remember,” she said.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s how we met.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember her blue eyes and her smile.  END
BEGIN NOW The tone and timber of her voice.  END
BEGIN NOW Offensively pleasent.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what i told her later.  END
BEGIN NOW She had the kind of voice you’d expect on a late night love song radio station.  END
BEGIN NOW She had the kind of voice that could give you the worst news and you’d be ok with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Her voice could sign peace treaties.  END
BEGIN NOW I relized slightly later on that there was something else about her.  END
BEGIN NOW Something that made me believe for a time that she was someone i’d been looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a line in Hemmingway.  END
BEGIN NOW In The Sun Also Rises.  END
BEGIN NOW When he described Lady Brett for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW “Her hair was cut short like a boys.  END
BEGIN NOW She started all that.  END
BEGIN NOW And built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht.”  That was Nikki all over.  END
BEGIN NOW And her face was the kind that turned heads and broke them.  END
BEGIN NOW When she didn’t think anyone was looking, her face seemed troubled.  END
BEGIN NOW Things like that.  END
BEGIN NOW little details.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve always prided myself on my powers of observation.  END
BEGIN NOW And Nikki stole my observations for a good while.  END
BEGIN NOW After our initial meeting not a lot happened for a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW She locked eyes often.  END
BEGIN NOW And little smiles.  END
BEGIN NOW Blushing.  END
BEGIN NOW That kind of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Then came Murphy’s birthday.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t usually drink with coworkers unless they find me at the bar or it’s a special occassion.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone’s last day.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone’s birthday.  END
BEGIN NOW For Murphy, I’d go out.  END
BEGIN NOW I felt like drinking anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW People went around after work, rallied the troops.  END
BEGIN NOW Nikki seemed hesitant.  END
BEGIN NOW She asked if i was going.  END
BEGIN NOW I said yes.  END
BEGIN NOW She said she would go too.  END
BEGIN NOW I was last out.  END
BEGIN NOW Got out around one.  END
BEGIN NOW Went to the bar, bought Murphy a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW Bought myself three.  END
BEGIN NOW Talked to all the people, smoked many cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW Didn’t talk to Nikki.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the other cooks was.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the bar closed.  END
BEGIN NOW  Kat and Dan were offering their place for the after party.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew that ment coke.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t working the next day so I said sure.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s do this.  END
BEGIN NOW it had been a while anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW I could use an early morning kinda night.  END
BEGIN NOW Then Nikki came along.  END
BEGIN NOW We each did a bump and sat on the couch, petting the dogs and talking until six.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t think too much of it.  END
BEGIN NOW But i did notice that she seemed to talk to me all night like nothing else mattered.  END
BEGIN NOW Then it was six and the sun was coming up.  END
BEGIN NOW So i said it was time for me to leave.  END
BEGIN NOW She got up as well.  END
BEGIN NOW We waited outside for her cab.  END
BEGIN NOW It was cold so i held her close and rubbed her back to keep her warm.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she looked up.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked up into my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW And we kissed.  END
BEGIN NOW Then her cab came.  END
BEGIN NOW I asked if she wanted to stay the night.  END
BEGIN NOW She said no and jumped in her cab and off to her own bed.  END
BEGIN NOW I bought some orange juice and went home.  END
BEGIN NOW A few days passed.  END
BEGIN NOW I worked in the kitchen and did my job and time flew by.  END
BEGIN NOW Then one night, before she left, Nikki handed me a slip of paper.  END
BEGIN NOW she said, “And this is for you.” and walked away.  END
BEGIN NOW She gave me her number.  END
BEGIN NOW I held that in my pocket for a good hour before i started sending her messeges.  END
BEGIN NOW She texted me back.  END
BEGIN NOW It was that kind of giddy, heart racing sort of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW This went on for several days.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there was a night.  END
BEGIN NOW I was closing the restaurant and Nikki was the closing server.  END
BEGIN NOW She asked if i wanted to get a drink when i got out.  END
BEGIN NOW I said yes of course.  END
BEGIN NOW I got out at one in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to sous vide a stack of pork bellies.  END
BEGIN NOW it took a while to get everything worked out.  END
BEGIN NOW When i made it to the bar, Nikki was hanging out with Ben, who was very drunk and going through some kind of crisis.  END
BEGIN NOW I joined them and listened to Ben talk about this and that and it was mostly a lot of drunken rambling.  END
BEGIN NOW The Domestication of Shun Feng END
BEGIN NOW I met her in late 2007.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember it being around thanksgiving.  END
BEGIN NOW Certainly before Christmas.  END
BEGIN NOW The exact date and time have long since vanished from memory.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost everything else about her hasn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW She was and is a pastry chef.  END
BEGIN NOW Her given name, the one her family calls her, means ship leaving harbor.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have known then that it would impossible to ever keep her around for long.  END
BEGIN NOW I had just moved to the bay area and was trying out at a new job.  END
BEGIN NOW Working next to her as the pantry cook.  END
BEGIN NOW My world was salads and long wooden platters of sliced meats and cheeses.  END
BEGIN NOW Hers was a world of sugar, confections, cakes and gelato.  END
BEGIN NOW I remember distinctly a kind of nervous energy between us.  END
BEGIN NOW Like when you meet someone and you don’t really make too much eye contact because you might get lost.  END
BEGIN NOW You might forget what you were doing.  END
BEGIN NOW it might unsettle your brain a little.  END
BEGIN NOW I did what i could not to think about it.  END
BEGIN NOW The job i had left in Santa Cruz was my life for two years.  END
BEGIN NOW The chef was a crazy, crack smoking alcoholic.  END
BEGIN NOW His sous chef wasn’t far behind.  END
BEGIN NOW The owner bounced checks and spent all day, everyday drinking his inventory.  END
BEGIN NOW The servers were all girls in their twenties.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly fresh from college or finishing up their degrees in art history or agriculture.  END
BEGIN NOW They were all very pretty and silly and we all spent a lot of time together in a very small manic restaurant in a back alley behind the movie theater.  END
BEGIN NOW There was one girl in particular, that ruined me for a little while.  END
BEGIN NOW Later on, ruined me much worse.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s another story for another time.  END
BEGIN NOW I came to the bay area with hopes of a fresh start.  END
BEGIN NOW Away from the drugs and the futility of chasing a skirt that was stuck in an empty relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW I was going to keep my head down, do my job, pay my rent and disregard everything else for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW a kind of autumnal cleansing.  END
BEGIN NOW That didn’t last very long.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe a week. END
BEGIN NOW The first thing i remember about Shun Feng was her cookies.  END
BEGIN NOW The night i was trying out the job, the restaurant was doing a special dinner and she made peanut butter bacon fat cookies shaped like little pigs.  END
BEGIN NOW She came flying back into the kitchen later in the evening to check on her assistant.  END
BEGIN NOW To check her cookies and check her assistant and see just how everything was going for the rest of the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think she said much to me.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe she didn’t say anything that night.  END
BEGIN NOW But there was a moment when our eyes met and a knowing look crossed our faces.  END
BEGIN NOW That uh oh look.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, we’re both in trouble now.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing has happened but this isn’t going to be ok for anyone involved.  END
BEGIN NOW I ended up getting the job, which paid terribly.  END
BEGIN NOW It was enough to keep enough bourbon in my system and a few cans of cheap beer around the apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes not enough to afford more than rolling tobacco.  END
BEGIN NOW I took home chicken carcasses from the restaurant and made soup.  END
BEGIN NOW We ate a lot of chicken soup and black beans with pasta.  END
BEGIN NOW We were poor but it was always just enough to not feel it too much. END
BEGIN NOW When i saw her again and we had to introduce ourselves she told me, “hi.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m Leslie.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been pooping funny, lately.” I don’t remember what i said exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW But it was probably nothing noteworthy.  END
BEGIN NOW i was still lying to myself then.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinking i could do my job, ignore everything else and get on with my life.  END
BEGIN NOW Leslie, i found out, was two years older than me.  END
BEGIN NOW Made really good gelato.  END
BEGIN NOW And was married.  END
BEGIN NOW Recently married.  END
BEGIN NOW And i thought, “well, that’s that.” A lot of my thoughts were way off then.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what you get for being young and thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW I spent a lot of those days getting very drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW Our apartment was near the south Berkeley ghetto, down on Russell and Sacramento.  END
BEGIN NOW My roommate was finishing his english degree at the University and his grandmother was paying his half of the rent.  END
BEGIN NOW The apartment was in her name and i sent her a check every month to cover my expenses.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we were in the ghetto and neither of us had the place in our name, we didn’t care too much what happened to the place.  END
BEGIN NOW We smoked inside, spilled beer all over the hardwood floor.  END
BEGIN NOW Let beans and hot sauce and cheap cheese become part of the oven.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to pass two bars on my way home each night.  END
BEGIN NOW The Acme and The Missouri.  END
BEGIN NOW In those days, there wasn’t much difference.  END
BEGIN NOW The Missouri had a large patio and a pool table.  END
BEGIN NOW The Acme had a pool table.  END
BEGIN NOW You could smoke in the Acme after nine, since the health inspector wasn’t likely to show up.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a glass jug with some mysterious special cocktail that no one ever drank.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a good bar with dim lights and a lot of whiskey.  END
BEGIN NOW The Missouri isn’t much different today.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t been very often since then.  END
BEGIN NOW It was our after work bar.  END
BEGIN NOW A watering hole for a lot of the local cooks.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot of things happened at that bar.  END
BEGIN NOW I like to leave it alone. END
BEGIN NOW I’m trying to remember when our first kiss was.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m pretty sure it was on the fourth of july.  END
BEGIN NOW We had gone through several months of flirting and teasing blushing and saying all manner of highly inappropriate things to each other.  END
BEGIN NOW When the fourth came around there was a big party at one of the cooks houses.  END
BEGIN NOW Around Lake Merritt.  END
BEGIN NOW I was on my way when Leslie called.  END
BEGIN NOW She had been drinking early and had a glow about her.  END
BEGIN NOW She waited for me outside.  END
BEGIN NOW When i came up to the place she said, “The neighbors have these fruit trees.” She walked me back to the trees and there was a fence that divided the cooks yard from us.  END
BEGIN NOW She lured me into her trap.  END
BEGIN NOW As soon as we were out of view she pushed me against the fence and put her mouth on mine.  END
BEGIN NOW Months of pent up sexual tension.  END
BEGIN NOW Weeks on weeks of little flutters of feelings.  END
BEGIN NOW And just like that.  END
BEGIN NOW It exploded.  END
BEGIN NOW She pushed me against the fence and kissed me.  END
BEGIN NOW She kissed me in a way that suggested she was starving, dehydrated.  END
BEGIN NOW And she just found a table laden with food and drink.  END
BEGIN NOW She kissed me like all the fireworks in Chinatown simultaneously erupting in a fountain of floral colors.  END
BEGIN NOW Then i kissed her back.  END
BEGIN NOW Then i knew i was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW We made it to the party and i started drinking and smoking with everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Eating the kind of old fashion barbecue food that cooks and chefs love more than most things.  END
BEGIN NOW We all got drunk and sang along to songs on the stereo and when the sun went down we lit fireworks and walked down to the lake to watch the real fireworks.  END
BEGIN NOW Not that what we burned wasn’t real.  END
BEGIN NOW But the big showstopper fireworks that you can feel the force of the explosion were over the lake.  END
BEGIN NOW We went back to the house and drank more and sang more and then it was time to go because Leslie was leaving i asked her for a ride. END
BEGIN NOW During the ride i must have tried to kiss her again about a dozen times.  END
BEGIN NOW I was very drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t understand that what was ok a few hours ago wasn’t as ok now.  END
BEGIN NOW She pulled up to my apartment and in one swift motion, unclicked my seat belt, opened the passenger door and pushed me out on the curb while she was pulling away.  END
BEGIN NOW Apparently, the way to my heart is riddled with abuse.  END
BEGIN NOW After that, there’s a spot of blur.  END
BEGIN NOW I got promoted to grill cook.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes i had to work brunch.  END
BEGIN NOW We played the kiss off as nothing to worry about for a little bit.  END
BEGIN NOW I think we did.  END
BEGIN NOW I know we were both really bad about pretending there was nothing going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Then there was a particularly brutal brunch.  END
BEGIN NOW I just remember wave after wave of burgers.  END
BEGIN NOW Eight back on eight back on eight.  END
BEGIN NOW for four straight hours.  END
BEGIN NOW My hungover face dripping sweat into the wood burning grill.  END
BEGIN NOW My arms getting more crisscrossed with burn scars by the minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Spatula in one hand, tongs in the other.  END
BEGIN NOW And plate after plate.  END
BEGIN NOW When it was over, i wanted a drink and a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s all i could think about.  END
BEGIN NOW I cleaned my station.  END
BEGIN NOW Prepped for the evening and clocked out.  END
BEGIN NOW I walked to the hotel bar because it was still early.  END
BEGIN NOW I like hotel bars because there’s a very different vibe.  END
BEGIN NOW People coming and going.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost no locals.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t run into people that know you at a hotel bar.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t in a mood for talking.  END
BEGIN NOW I drank four bourbon and sodas.  END
BEGIN NOW I hadn’t eaten all day.  END
BEGIN NOW In a haze, i walked home.  END
BEGIN NOW I opened the door, went to my room and collapsed in bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Then my phone rang.  END
BEGIN NOW It was Leslie.  END
BEGIN NOW “I just got out.  END
BEGIN NOW Are you ok?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, i’m just fine.” I said. END
BEGIN NOW “Can I come over?” And i was too tired to know what she meant by that. END
BEGIN NOW “Sure.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m here.  END
BEGIN NOW let me know.” END
BEGIN NOW I opened the door and She pushed her way through.  END
BEGIN NOW She closed the door, and pushed me right back into my bed and closed the door.  END
BEGIN NOW She started kissing me and taking my shirt off.  END
BEGIN NOW Then my pants.  END
BEGIN NOW I was trying to keep up.  END
BEGIN NOW I managed to get most of her clothes off and return some of her kisses.  END
BEGIN NOW we were like two animals just freed from captivity.  END
BEGIN NOW We hungered and thirsted.  END
BEGIN NOW We almost devoured each other.  END
BEGIN NOW There was something violent about that first time.  END
BEGIN NOW You read sex scenes sometimes and it tries to be very sensual and poetic.  END
BEGIN NOW This was more like a cage match.  END
BEGIN NOW We fucked like our lives depended on it.  END
BEGIN NOW We fucked each other for four hours.  END
BEGIN NOW Only pausing to catch our breath.  END
BEGIN NOW Every other sexual encounter I had had until then was rendered null and void.  END
BEGIN NOW Compared to what happened with Leslie, everything before wasn’t sex.  END
BEGIN NOW Just an approximation.  END
BEGIN NOW A rough estimation.  END
BEGIN NOW Before Leslie, I felt like i’d only read about sex in books written by people that heard about it third hand. END
BEGIN NOW The problem was, we fit together.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes you meet someone and they just fit right in there.  END
BEGIN NOW In your arms, in your thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW You laugh at each others jokes, and not politely.  END
BEGIN NOW You like a lot of the same things, but know them from different angles.  END
BEGIN NOW After the sweat cooled on our bodies, we lied in my bed just staring at each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Not saying anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Eyes locked for what seemed an hour.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes we smiled.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes we looked really concerned.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes we just breathed.  END
BEGIN NOW She was still married. END
BEGIN NOW After that day she would call me in the mornings.  END
BEGIN NOW Early, around seven or so.  END
BEGIN NOW Right after her husband went to work.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost every day that he went to work or went out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW “Can I come over? Do you have time for me?” She would say. END
BEGIN NOW And I always said yes.  END
BEGIN NOW Why wouldn’t I? There was nothing for me to lose. END
BEGIN NOW This went on for four months.  END
BEGIN NOW during that time we broke up and got back together about fourteen times.  END
BEGIN NOW we couldn’t be away for long. END
BEGIN NOW And she would always take me places.  END
BEGIN NOW She took me to Indian Rock for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW Up to Grizzly Peak.  END
BEGIN NOW Out to Korean barbeque where i wouldn’t have been able to order anyway since no one spoke english.  END
BEGIN NOW But the food was always amazing.  END
BEGIN NOW The views were always the kind that kick you in the stomach.  END
BEGIN NOW There was always more than just the sex.  END
BEGIN NOW We told each other, numerous times.  END
BEGIN NOW That this was a very narcissistic relationship.  END
BEGIN NOW We felt like we were dating ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW And it was mostly true.  END
BEGIN NOW Except she was married.  END
BEGIN NOW And i asked her dumb questions like, “if you weren’t married, would you date me?”  END
BEGIN NOW Then there was a time she took me up by the rose gardens on the hill.  END
BEGIN NOW Right around sunset.  END
BEGIN NOW and we were sitting there and it was all too much and i turned to her.  END
BEGIN NOW and i let that thing come out of my mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW That evil, barbed string of words and binds many and frees nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW I told her that i loved her.  END
BEGIN NOW And she stopped because she knew as well as i did.  END
BEGIN NOW And she said it back.  END
BEGIN NOW We spent several hours kissing and holding each other like, oh shit.  END
BEGIN NOW This just got really complicated.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, you can’t just go back from that.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, the bag gave birth to the cat and now that motherfucker is out for blood.  END
BEGIN NOW My favorite date that we ever went on took place in my room.  END
BEGIN NOW After the restaurant closed and I was out of work and she was working the counter at a pizza place, she came over with some leftovers and a bottle of wine.  END
BEGIN NOW We stayed up passing the bottle back and forth.  END
BEGIN NOW We took turns reading from books to each other and eating pizza.  END
BEGIN NOW We never fucked that night.  END
BEGIN NOW We kissed a little bit.  END
BEGIN NOW We slept together, which only happened when her husband was out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW We slept soundly.  END
BEGIN NOW Peacefully.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll never forget that night.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope i never forget that night.  END
BEGIN NOW It all ended at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really remember the last days much.  END
BEGIN NOW But i knew it was coming.  END
BEGIN NOW It became harder and harder to see her.  END
BEGIN NOW Her marriage was hanging by a thread and she knew it.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew there were other men in her life.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t know when or how or why.  END
BEGIN NOW But it happened.  END
BEGIN NOW And like that.  END
BEGIN NOW She was gone.  END
BEGIN NOW And I was broken for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t want anything or anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t want.  END
BEGIN NOW I couldn’t think.  END
BEGIN NOW There was only a void.  END
BEGIN NOW The ship had left the harbour.  END
BEGIN NOW I saw her a year later.  END
BEGIN NOW Around the time i thought i was moving to new york with my roommate.  END
BEGIN NOW That never happened.  END
BEGIN NOW But we believed it.  END
BEGIN NOW I saw her for a night and we got coffee and caught up.  END
BEGIN NOW When we said goodbye i kissed her.  END
BEGIN NOW I told her to hold me like she wasn’t going to see me for a very long time.  END
BEGIN NOW That much was true. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t until recently, about a month ago, that i saw her again.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that got away.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s what she was.  END
BEGIN NOW And will be.  END
BEGIN NOW I heard she moved to the city and got a good job in the Embarcadero.  END
BEGIN NOW So I sent her a message.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s get a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW It had been a good three years.  END
BEGIN NOW We had some catching up to do.  END
BEGIN NOW There wasn’t a day in those three years that she didn’t cross my mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even one.  END
BEGIN NOW Because i counted.  END
BEGIN NOW Because no one ever got to me like she did.  END
BEGIN NOW I saw her when she just got off work.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t do anything to pretty up.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair was a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW Her clothes were definitely the ones closest to her in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW She looked just as beautiful as i remembered.  END
BEGIN NOW her face still glowed.  END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes still had this brightness when she saw me.  END
BEGIN NOW And i was the one that worried about my hair, my clothes, how i smelled.  END
BEGIN NOW if my socks matched.  END
BEGIN NOW She didn’t care at all.  END
BEGIN NOW She was happy to see me.  END
BEGIN NOW And i could hardly believe my eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW How long had i waited for this moment.  END
BEGIN NOW How many hours over the years had i thought about this one person and how much she means to me.  END
BEGIN NOW and there she was.  END
BEGIN NOW right there.  END
BEGIN NOW We went and got a drink. END
BEGIN NOW And there are those people.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been written about and everyone knows them.  END
BEGIN NOW That you don’t see for years and it’s like you just saw them.  END
BEGIN NOW Like time means nothing between you.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a string of events that’s only good for laughs or a moment of silence.  END
BEGIN NOW That was us.  END
BEGIN NOW And laughing like we used to.  END
BEGIN NOW Timed right.  END
BEGIN NOW Our jokes landed on each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Our snarky commentary hit just on point.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a lot like old times.  END
BEGIN NOW Until it was time for me to catch my train home.  END
BEGIN NOW I had work in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW She walked me to a place that made directions easy.  END
BEGIN NOW And we held each other again.  END
BEGIN NOW I kissed her head and she kissed me back.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she turned around and ran.  END
BEGIN NOW She ran up the hill and back home.  END
BEGIN NOW i saw her again about a month later.  END
BEGIN NOW on a whim i decided to go eat at her restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW By chance, i ended up sitting at the bar next to the door to the kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW I sat down just as she was coming out to talk to one of the servers.  END
BEGIN NOW I tried to catch her eye.  END
BEGIN NOW It took a few minutes, but she did a double take.  END
BEGIN NOW She walked into the kitchen then poked her head back out to check.  END
BEGIN NOW And she gave me another one of her hugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Very tight.  END
BEGIN NOW Like she was trying to press herself into me.  END
BEGIN NOW She started taking bandage wrappings out of her pocket and putting them in my lap.  END
BEGIN NOW “This is for you.” she said.  END
BEGIN NOW There was some VIP thing she had to take care of, and off she went.  END
BEGIN NOW I ate very well.  END
BEGIN NOW The food was perfect.  END
BEGIN NOW She came out to see how i was doing.  END
BEGIN NOW I paired a cocktail with each course.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender was a lovely man.  END
BEGIN NOW He paired a glass of wine as well.  END
BEGIN NOW The wine was on the house.  END
BEGIN NOW I was trying not to get too drunk.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough of a buzz that I was in character.  END
BEGIN NOW But i wanted to remember every detail.  END
BEGIN NOW A fine line that i’ve crossed more often than not.  END
BEGIN NOW Leslie came out with three desserts.  END
BEGIN NOW I ordered a sorbet because that’s all i was feeling like.  END
BEGIN NOW But her pastry work had come a long way.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything had a hint of sweetness.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing was overbearing.  END
BEGIN NOW Subtle, savoury touches, little bits of “wow, what is that…” It was a beautiful meal.  END
BEGIN NOW It was one of the nicest times i’ve taken myself out.  END
BEGIN NOW She got off work around the time i was finishing up.  END
BEGIN NOW My timing, for once, was spot on.  END
BEGIN NOW She had parked her car in the east bay and took the train over.  END
BEGIN NOW Even better, so i thought.  END
BEGIN NOW I figured i could stay on until North Berkeley, she could give me a ride home, maybe come up for a drink.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed like a fine plan.  END
BEGIN NOW This is, afterall, what i wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to know.  END
BEGIN NOW I needed to know if all these years away, all this time we’d spent with other people was just an intermission.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a place in my heart that was waiting for an answer to this.  END
BEGIN NOW And it was hardly fair to anyone i dated in the meantime. END
BEGIN NOW On the train, i might have been a little wobbly.  END
BEGIN NOW Certainly all the booze was catching up to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t remember too much about what we talked about.  END
BEGIN NOW But i remember my stop was coming up and i told her about the idea of me staying on and getting a ride back.  END
BEGIN NOW Then she dropped her little bomb on me.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a guy.  END
BEGIN NOW She was trying to get knocked up.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s when i got off the train.  END
BEGIN NOW The boat was leaving harbour.  END
BEGIN NOW and it wasn’t going to come back.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless this is some kind of Tangled Up in Blue story and we’ll meet again and she’ll have a kid and the man will be gone and god only knows what kind of shit that will be.  END
BEGIN NOW But the chapter closed.  END
BEGIN NOW The end.  END
BEGIN NOW True Story, Never Happened. END
BEGIN NOW When you tell a story to someone, face to face, most of the time it begins like, “So this one time…” or “I remember once…” I barely remember this story, and it just happened. END
BEGIN NOW I’ve worked many a different job growing up.  END
BEGIN NOW My first job was at a library in a small town.  END
BEGIN NOW I shelved books and watched pretty girls do homework.  END
BEGIN NOW My boss was a librarian with a degree.  END
BEGIN NOW Of her age I know nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW She had a magnificent rose garden.  END
BEGIN NOW She was quirky and charming.  END
BEGIN NOW She wore long hippie dresses and lots of necklaces.  END
BEGIN NOW Her hair was a wild chestnut mess of curls.  END
BEGIN NOW I was fourteen at the time and this was a good way to be spending my time after school.  END
BEGIN NOW A year later, while still working at the library I was hired to test software for a friend of the family.  END
BEGIN NOW I had a knack for computers and thought I wanted to become a programmer.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a graphic designer.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe work with video games.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t really know.  END
BEGIN NOW After doing the work for a while I found it tedious and dull.  END
BEGIN NOW I spent a lot of my time drinking Coke and chatting to friends.  END
BEGIN NOW After about a year of working with software, I was laid off.  END
BEGIN NOW I had seen a lot of the nonsense that happen in California during was was later called The Bubble.  END
BEGIN NOW  All expense paid trips to San Francisco for a weekend of conferences.  END
BEGIN NOW Booths and booths of various small companies trying desperately to hock their products at sales reps from other companies.  END
BEGIN NOW  There was money everywhere, at the time.  END
BEGIN NOW A friend of a friend had a job description of “Network Monitor”.  END
BEGIN NOW  His job was to make sure the network was running.  END
BEGIN NOW  Not to fix it if something wrong happened.  END
BEGIN NOW Just to watch things.  END
BEGIN NOW Make sure everything’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW  The building he worked in had a beer tap in the staff room.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything was paid for by the company.  END
BEGIN NOW And he played video games all day.  END
BEGIN NOW And all night.  END
BEGIN NOW He was one of many. END
BEGIN NOW Then everything went to shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t even remember why, exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it was the stock market.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it was people getting wise to all that money just being thrown around for the hell of it.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit happens.  END
BEGIN NOW My next job was a short stint as a web site designer.  END
BEGIN NOW My boss was a large man with a platinum blond comb over.  END
BEGIN NOW His nose Rudolphed.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was creepy.  END
BEGIN NOW And I know creepy is one of those words that could mean many things.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d say he was creepy like a pedophile.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a pedo grin.  END
BEGIN NOW He had beady child molester eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He always addressed me as either Sport or Bud.  END
BEGIN NOW I latest about two months and then I was fired.  END
BEGIN NOW Fired for trying to download a cartoon.  END
BEGIN NOW Two months later the office was raided by the FBI.  END
BEGIN NOW  I never heard what they were looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW But I’d guess it was child pornography.  END
BEGIN NOW I went to college for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW It was alright but I never settled on a real major.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead I started working at a video store in the same small town where the library was.  END
BEGIN NOW The video store was small.  END
BEGIN NOW I saw the same people, the same families, the same people that worked next door.  END
BEGIN NOW I worked with a fat guy named Will.  END
BEGIN NOW Will spent most of his time watching movies or making out with his fat girlfriend.  END
BEGIN NOW  Sometimes he would do both.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he also ate pizza from the place next door.  END
BEGIN NOW  I remember seeing the two of them, greasy faced, and slobbering all over each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Right behind the counter.  END
BEGIN NOW In view of the front window.  END
BEGIN NOW It was grotesque. END
BEGIN NOW My boss was another fat man.  END
BEGIN NOW This time with a fat wife and two terrible little children.  END
BEGIN NOW  The children were hellraisers.  END
BEGIN NOW  Loud and obnoxious and full of energy and whining.  END
BEGIN NOW My fat boss was always fighting with his fat wife or the insane children.  END
BEGIN NOW He was, aside from a loving father, a nerd and a pervert.  END
BEGIN NOW He liked guns.  END
BEGIN NOW  He was also an awful manager.  END
BEGIN NOW I found his notebook at work one time.  END
BEGIN NOW He spied on me and called from his car.  END
BEGIN NOW He distrusted everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW While I may have broke trust by reading the notebook, he disgusted me.  END
BEGIN NOW He loved being the boss and breaking his own rules.  END
BEGIN NOW I worked my ass off for some reason.  END
BEGIN NOW  It was a video store and there’s really not a whole lot of ass busting that needs to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW But I did a damn good job with what I was given.  END
BEGIN NOW I have, at least, a good work ethic.  END
BEGIN NOW I can work hard and pick up after other people with no complaints.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t really bother me that much.  END
BEGIN NOW But then a friend of mine got me a job at a warehouse packaging French car parts. END
BEGIN NOW I quit the video store and commuted an hour every morning to a city that is predominately populated by Mexicans.  END
BEGIN NOW My boss’s name was Miles Potter and he worked from a trailer inside the building.  END
BEGIN NOW The warehouse was all shelving and workbench.  END
BEGIN NOW We spent a lot of time putting exhaust pipes in bins or stacking radiators.  END
BEGIN NOW We shipped windshields and doors.  END
BEGIN NOW Wipers, fans, and seats.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a good jungle gym.  END
BEGIN NOW We had a fork lift at our disposal.  END
BEGIN NOW My friend that got me the job worked at photographing parts for a catalog.  END
BEGIN NOW My other coworkers were a fat redheaded girl named Cory and her cousin, Gabe.  END
BEGIN NOW Gabe and Cory also lived together.  END
BEGIN NOW They were two of the biggest stoners and drunks I’d ever met.  END
BEGIN NOW We had a good time together, ate a lot of Mexican food and smoked a lot of weed.  END
BEGIN NOW It was an easy job and paid more than any job I’d had before.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside from the commute, it was wonderful.  END
BEGIN NOW Then I started getting interested in food. END
BEGIN NOW I’d had to cook for myself growing up.  END
BEGIN NOW My mother and father both worked nights for a time.  END
BEGIN NOW Food became serious business when I turned twenty.  END
BEGIN NOW I still remember the sweetbreads I ate on my birthday.  END
BEGIN NOW I had been talking to a friend about food for a while and we both loved to cook.  END
BEGIN NOW She suggested that I get serious about it and drop my dreams of being an artist.  END
BEGIN NOW My then girlfriend had moved back to Idaho to be with her family at the time and this seemed like a good chance to go back to school, get out of town and be with the girl.  END
BEGIN NOW I signed up for culinary school in Boise, Idaho.  END
BEGIN NOW The school was small and low budget.  END
BEGIN NOW The chefs were mostly soft cooks that had failed to hack it at a real restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW They were always in-fighting and picking favorites.  END
BEGIN NOW The other students were a mix of talented, driven cooks and people that were lost and thought that cooking for a living was an answer.  END
BEGIN NOW I fell in more with the ones that wanted to be chefs in their own restaurants.  END
BEGIN NOW  The ones that would have study sessions at the nearest dive bar.  END
BEGIN NOW These were my kind of people.  END
BEGIN NOW I made it through one semester and my student loans ran out.  END
BEGIN NOW There was an advertisement for a dishwasher on the bulletin board at school.  END
BEGIN NOW I walked in to the building wearing a white chef coat and black pants.  END
BEGIN NOW The uniform.  END
BEGIN NOW  It was a seafood steakhouse.  END
BEGIN NOW  Idaho was a steak and potatoes kind of place.  END
BEGIN NOW It was also, I later learned, one of the top five restaurants in the city.  END
BEGIN NOW The chef and the sous chef were both graduates from the school I was in.  END
BEGIN NOW The chef’s name was Dustin but I still only call him Chef.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a tall man with broad shoulders.  END
BEGIN NOW He had thick black hair and a well manicured beard.  END
BEGIN NOW Both ears were pierced with large silver rings.  END
BEGIN NOW He always wore blue tinted prescription sunglasses.  END
BEGIN NOW He had above everything else, a fantastic sense of humor.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a lot of laughter in that kitchen.  END
BEGIN NOW He never let me touch the dish pit and put me on at night, working the pantry.  END
BEGIN NOW The pantry station is where all the deserts and salads and sometimes, appetizers come from at a restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it’s also called cold side.  END
BEGIN NOW Hot side is where the grill and broil stations are.  END
BEGIN NOW I was trained by a short Hispanic lesbian named Rose.  END
BEGIN NOW She was adorable in character and appearance.  END
BEGIN NOW  I jumped at a chance to do everything.  END
BEGIN NOW I was eager, ready to help any way that I could.  END
BEGIN NOW I would ask her about every ticket that came in.  END
BEGIN NOW I was really annoying. END
BEGIN NOW The summer came and while off from school I worked full time.  END
BEGIN NOW I was improving quickly at my job and taking on more responsibilities.  END
BEGIN NOW  I became the prep cook.  END
BEGIN NOW The prep cook touches every dish that goes out.  END
BEGIN NOW The prep cook is responsible for the quality of everything everyone else had to cook.  END
BEGIN NOW The prep cook also has his own kitchen to work in.  END
BEGIN NOW The typical shift was from nine in the morning till four in the afternoon when the dinner service started.  END
BEGIN NOW  I would work until six or seven then sit in the bar drinking our company’s micro brews and then walking home to my apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW The summer passed by then came time for school again.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to balance school, work and the girlfriend hit me hard.  END
BEGIN NOW I was stressed out to the point of shitting blood.  END
BEGIN NOW  I went to see the doctors.  END
BEGIN NOW They said acid reflux.  END
BEGIN NOW Stress.  END
BEGIN NOW Lack of sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Bad diet.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop smoking.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t drink so much.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead of listening to them I dropped out of school and told my girlfriend that I was moving to Seattle with or without her.  END
BEGIN NOW  She chose to stay.  END
BEGIN NOW And I never made it to Seattle.  END
BEGIN NOW Ending our six years together. END
BEGIN NOW Then I started making friends at work.  END
BEGIN NOW We started hanging out at bars and strip clubs.  END
BEGIN NOW I was having fun.  END
BEGIN NOW No one bothered me about smoking cigarettes any more.  END
BEGIN NOW Or drinking too much.  END
BEGIN NOW Excess was encouraged.  END
BEGIN NOW Cooks are notorious for their drinking. END
BEGIN NOW he scariest thing is the blank page.  END
BEGIN NOW so i’m just going to type until it goes away.  END
BEGIN NOW first a few words to warm up the old fingers.  END
BEGIN NOW get things moving.  END
BEGIN NOW rusty.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s what i’ve been but another november is upon us which means it’s time.  END
BEGIN NOW time to stop making excuses and just sit down and do it.  END
BEGIN NOW my foot is hurting anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW lots of walking the last few days.  END
BEGIN NOW so it’s sunday anyway and that’s a day of rest.  END
BEGIN NOW the mechanics are a slow.  END
BEGIN NOW i can’t remember how to type fast.  END
BEGIN NOW lots of errors.  END
BEGIN NOW backspaces.  END
BEGIN NOW that sort of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s been too long and i’m way out of practice.  END
BEGIN NOW anyway plow on.  END
BEGIN NOW keep going also i need to break out of the habit of double spaces after a new line.  END
BEGIN NOW but it’s just so hard wired into my now.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a slight hangover for the first time in months.  END
BEGIN NOW since july.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess it’s kinda nice at this point.  END
BEGIN NOW like an old friend stopping by for a visit.  END
BEGIN NOW jesus my words per minute must be attrocious.  END
BEGIN NOW but no matter just keep typing. END
BEGIN NOW so we’re going to write a story for november and it’s going to be a november story.  END
BEGIN NOW I have done no planning for this project aside from a passing thought about it every other day.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing has been committed to paper digital or traditional.  END
BEGIN NOW i have a jug of tea and a vaporizer for nicotine.  END
BEGIN NOW Because i’m living in the future.  END
BEGIN NOW this is all just greasing the wheel to get the idea of writing back in my brain.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not like riding a bike.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides with my injury, the whole bike riding metaphor is a big old fuck you.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s just like riding a bike.  END
BEGIN NOW except you front tire gets stuck in the muni track and end up smashed on the pavement with a broken wrist and a broken ankle.  END
BEGIN NOW and you’ve been in bed since July.  END
BEGIN NOW you’ve been in bed for 4 months.  END
BEGIN NOW one third of a year.  END
BEGIN NOW Chirst that’s a bit of time.  END
BEGIN NOW you could have done so much.  END
BEGIN NOW you could have writing.  END
BEGIN NOW been writing, learned something read something worked on your upper body, learned a language.  END
BEGIN NOW learned to code.  END
BEGIN NOW done something.  END
BEGIN NOW played games, watched movies and tv shows.  END
BEGIN NOW scanned millions of ports and several hundred servers.  END
BEGIN NOW mapping targets.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we’re at war.  END
BEGIN NOW we’ve been at war and the battlefield is digital and physical at the same time.  END
BEGIN NOW every day life is at stake, your identity is at stake.  END
BEGIN NOW everything you’ve grown comfortable with is at stake.  END
BEGIN NOW So i’m going to write about the global cold war.  END
BEGIN NOW Cold war two.  END
BEGIN NOW i suppose that i was reasearching this whole thing because i’ve been reading the news everyday.  END
BEGIN NOW mostly the tech.  END
BEGIN NOW but since we’re moving into an election year, it’s been pretty interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW so in this story we have some major players.  END
BEGIN NOW The US and Russia.  END
BEGIN NOW China, Syria, the UK, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, korea, India, Romania, We have corperations like google, microsoft and apple.  END
BEGIN NOW tesla, symantic, various labs, LBL should be in there for old times sake.  END
BEGIN NOW University campuses should have a spot but we can’t get too spread out.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t have time to go that far.  END
BEGIN NOW We have various hacker collectives, in all the countries listed above.  END
BEGIN NOW We have some everyday normal people that get caught up in the storm.  END
BEGIN NOW We build the storm and break it.  END
BEGIN NOW So lets’ see… END
BEGIN NOW Our main dude should be someone with a blasie day job.  END
BEGIN NOW something fairly mundane, but gives him time to pursue his hobby, which is infosec.  END
BEGIN NOW he doesn’t have a wife or kids or many friends, he has a few online aquainteces.  END
BEGIN NOW but thats about it.  END
BEGIN NOW He should be a busboy.  END
BEGIN NOW because i can write that.  END
BEGIN NOW OK.  END
BEGIN NOW so he works at a small restaurant for some armenians.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re writing a techothriller at heart here so we need to keep that in mind.  END
BEGIN NOW Perspective is key.  END
BEGIN NOW We should open with his studio apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW Bird noise.  END
BEGIN NOW That was always a tip.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been at it all night again.  END
BEGIN NOW When your hobby is like a second job, and your first job gets out around one in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW you start late, you finish late.  END
BEGIN NOW The coffee has been cold for hours now and his ashtray is overflowing.  END
BEGIN NOW The carpet has ash stains.  END
BEGIN NOW bits of old pizza.  END
BEGIN NOW clothes strewn about because he doesn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW He got home, turned the screens on and watched.  END
BEGIN NOW He left for work that afternoon and before he did he set up a scan.  END
BEGIN NOW He always sets up a scan before he leaves.  END
BEGIN NOW It can take hours.  END
BEGIN NOW and might as well not let that processing power go to waste.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s jacked into the neighbors WiFi, routing through a VPN, proxied to TOR.  END
BEGIN NOW What that means is that his connection is about one fifth what it normally is.  END
BEGIN NOW Things can take a while to go over the pipe.  END
BEGIN NOW The block he’s scanning belongs to a community college in Ohio.  END
BEGIN NOW he’s been chipping away at their network for weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW Slowing building a map.  END
BEGIN NOW He needs to know everything.  END
BEGIN NOW the goal is to gain nodes for his botnet.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t have a plan for his collection.  END
BEGIN NOW But it’s nice to know it’s there.  END
BEGIN NOW Sneak in, gain access, maintain hiding.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s never destructive.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not the goal.  END
BEGIN NOW The goal isn’t really that clear to him at the moment. END
BEGIN NOW The birds are chirping outside his balcony.  END
BEGIN NOW inside one of his screens is streaming text.  END
BEGIN NOW verbose output from a block of IP addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW Digital ping pong.  END
BEGIN NOW His computer sending a signal through the neighbors router, bouncing it off a server in the east cost, over the atlantic, through germany, down to egypt, back to the UK, over to Ohio, across town to the community college campus, to a computer lab.  END
BEGIN NOW The signal is saying HEY HELLO! and it’s waiting for an answer that says OH HEY! I”M HERE! when that happens the scan will ask a few more questions, like what are you? what do you do? what version are you running? how much information are you willing to give me? END
BEGIN NOW It used to be easier before firewalls became standard practice.  END
BEGIN NOW Now he has to go slowing, fragment the packets, try to evade detection.  END
BEGIN NOW Not raise any eyebrows over in Ohio.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s looking for machinces that have been neglected by the administrator.  END
BEGIN NOW Something forgotton.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s more common at college campuses.  END
BEGIN NOW With computers in every room and labs set up all over the place, something is bound to be missed.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes a machine can go with being updated for years.  END
BEGIN NOW And all it takes is one loose bolt.  END
BEGIN NOW One default user account.  END
BEGIN NOW One unpatched program. END
BEGIN NOW His screen stops scrolling.  END
BEGIN NOW The scan has found something interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW The box was set up for students to learn the basics of running a web server.  END
BEGIN NOW That means it has several open ports.  END
BEGIN NOW 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 443, 445.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s enough to start.  END
BEGIN NOW He probes further.  END
BEGIN NOW FTP, SSh, Telnet, Sendmail, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, and Samba.  END
BEGIN NOW Goldmine.  END
BEGIN NOW He pokes until he learns the version of each piece of software on the other end.  END
BEGIN NOW The version of sendmail hasn’t been updated in a few years.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows there’s a hole in the code that he can squirm into.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes notes about the server, the address, the open ports and any other information he’s got at this point.  END
BEGIN NOW In another terminal he opens a script.  END
BEGIN NOW The script opens the hole by wedging a small block of code into the process.  END
BEGIN NOW The code casues the software to slip into the root account.  END
BEGIN NOW He now has priviledges.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes a new account with equal access.  END
BEGIN NOW He goes through the logs and erases the evidence.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes some notes.  END
BEGIN NOW He pokes around the server, checking out what he’s got.  END
BEGIN NOW what he’s connected to.  END
BEGIN NOW He grabs the list of usernames and passwords, encrypted for now.  END
BEGIN NOW He logs out of the computer in ohio, the UK, Egypt, Germany, Boston, and the neighbors.  END
BEGIN NOW he types a command that opens a program that starts the long process of cracking the encrypted passwords he just stole.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not the longest list.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only going to take a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW He turns the monitor off.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks to the balcony and lights a cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW He sits and smokes and watches the birds.  END
BEGIN NOW The birds are pinging each other too.  END
BEGIN NOW He flicks the cigarette butt off the baclony, closes the door, closes the blinds, crawls into bed and shuts down.  END
BEGIN NOW ok a rough start.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s for sure.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s to be expected.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t done this in a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, trying to make technical writing exciting is quite a task.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure where to go from here.  END
BEGIN NOW but that’s what begingings are for.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we should back of the tech shit for a minute and find another character to pick at.  END
BEGIN NOW Since i have nothing in mind this is going to be interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW One goal for this project is to leave romance and sex out of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Which means, i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW more politics i suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to be a challange but that’s what this is all about anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW challangers like the challanger exploding into a million shiny bits all floating back to earth in a big blaze of gory.  END
BEGIN NOW We can do this.  END
BEGIN NOW focus.  END
BEGIN NOW ficus, fingerpaints.  END
BEGIN NOW aliviate alliteration anxiety try our thought process today tons of satisfied costuomers.  END
BEGIN NOW tumors and rumors and ballon animal misfit food fight down right scray subliminal animal magnets.  END
BEGIN NOW mezmerizing mexican food allegories stories and something something… bang on and on and tap and tips and ticka ticka ticker tape parade and it’s almost thanksgiving.  END
BEGIN NOW grieving and relieaving and other nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW ok ok ok.  END
BEGIN NOW back to it keep going until the fingers fall off or get in line and line em up and rail it down and my god it’s been a long time since i’ve coked the caine.  END
BEGIN NOW choked the chain and smoked a plain jane mary.  END
BEGIN NOW drug metaphors maybe, it’s been a while since i’ve been out of my head and maybe that’s not such a good thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I have that salvia sitting around somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW but i don’t know about that.  END
BEGIN NOW there’s still plenty of weed.  END
BEGIN NOW more than i could smoke unless i went back to my stoner days.  END
BEGIN NOW lets’ not deviate reinstate or statis.  END
BEGIN NOW  one of that thank you lets keep the ball rolling don’t mind the wrist cramping.  END
BEGIN NOW keep going pound away type type typists and AND… END
BEGIN NOW well that petered out pretty quickyly lets’ see if the rolling ball can provide some more inspiration for our tale.  END
BEGIN NOW Told by toddlers and tell tale taxiderminsts determinest dermal dremel detriments.  END
BEGIN NOW a fun game is seeing how many words are words and which ones are just sounds that i’m throwing together in a kind of what just happened thing.  END
BEGIN NOW oh well whatever nevermind.  END
BEGIN NOW thanks Kurt.  END
BEGIN NOW i guess. END
BEGIN NOW I’ve managed to get over the daily minimum word count, but most of it is garbage.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s ok i guess.  END
BEGIN NOW because i’m starting all over again.  END
BEGIN NOW anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW this story has nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW I have a rough idea and even then there’s nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW cold war two, world wide and real is actually a thing that’s happening right now.  END
BEGIN NOW The fact that we’re on the edge of hot war with china, already in it with Syria, Afganistan, Iraq, Iran, Egypt.  END
BEGIN NOW That makes it easier and more difficult.  END
BEGIN NOW I can draw on real world events.  END
BEGIN NOW but at the same time i’m trying to write fiction.  END
BEGIN NOW well, fictionesque. END
BEGIN NOW Changing the pace to old cowboy music.  END
BEGIN NOW let’s see where that takes us.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re talking about digital cowboys anway.  END
BEGIN NOW So lets get on it. END
BEGIN NOW “what do we know so far?” END
BEGIN NOW The board room is a long oval table with a confrence call device in the middle.  END
BEGIN NOW The table is seated by eight people ranging in ethnic backrounds, mostly in their thirties.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly men.  END
BEGIN NOW everyone has a laptop in front of them.  END
BEGIN NOW some also have tablets, cell phones. END
BEGIN NOW “We know the attacks have been coming in from China.  END
BEGIN NOW We know they’ve compromised two data centers in the last month.  END
BEGIN NOW One in Los Angeles, one in Seattle.  END
BEGIN NOW The extent of the breech has yet to be determined.  END
BEGIN NOW Potentially, they could have everything.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d need some heavy storage to keep it.” A man says. END
BEGIN NOW “Goddamnit.” The man at the end of the table swivels in his chair, facing a large whiteboard.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a diagram on the board that has lines drawn between several nodes.  END
BEGIN NOW Addresses of each part of the chain.  END
BEGIN NOW “Are the Chinese going to work with us on this?” He swivels back around to face the table. END
BEGIN NOW “No response yet,” a young woman replies.  END
BEGIN NOW “Our contacts at China Telecom are aware of the attacks, from what we can tell, are pursuing action.” She taps a stylus on the table. END
BEGIN NOW “ END
BEGIN NOW I looked around the room, at the table of people seated around it. END
BEGIN NOW disgusting.  END
BEGIN NOW Just look at them.  END
BEGIN NOW All of them.  END
BEGIN NOW pathetic bunch.  END
BEGIN NOW And there they all are, being the sick, sad sacks of shit I’ve known all my life.  END
BEGIN NOW Everywhere i go, there they are.  END
BEGIN NOW It really just makes you want to puke all over everything. END
BEGIN NOW At the end of the table is a pervert.  END
BEGIN NOW He scratches his shitty beard.  END
BEGIN NOW His beard hides his stupid chin.  END
BEGIN NOW His chin hides the fat on his neck.  END
BEGIN NOW His voice is weak.  END
BEGIN NOW He sweats when he talks.  END
BEGIN NOW His laughter is nervous.  END
BEGIN NOW And he laughes at everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing genuine.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not in his capacity.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t even know how to authenticate his emotions.  END
BEGIN NOW All he knows is lust.  END
BEGIN NOW Greedy and all consuming.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes are small and fat from his face gives the appearance that his features are sinking into his skull.  END
BEGIN NOW His eyes shift and refocus constantly.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s like a man paranoid that someone can read his mind.  END
BEGIN NOW They can see the poison of his thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW IF you could read him for even a minute you wouldn’t be able to eat, you’d lose your appetite.  END
BEGIN NOW Your slab of new york stripe would turn into a grey wad of rotting flesh.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s laughing at the girl to his left. END
BEGIN NOW Lefty is a vapid little shit too.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s got a shirt on a size too small.  END
BEGIN NOW It gets her attention.  END
BEGIN NOW She needs that attention or she would die.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh my god she would just die right there.  END
BEGIN NOW you don’t even know.  END
BEGIN NOW she’s not even telling a story.  END
BEGIN NOW she says things like oh wow, that’s sooooo funny.  END
BEGIN NOW she doesn’t laugh.  END
BEGIN NOW she doesn’t even smile.  END
BEGIN NOW she smiles when it’s over because she thinks the person she’s not listening to is full of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW He is full of shit and we’ll get to him next.  END
BEGIN NOW As long as someone is looking at her.  END
BEGIN NOW She would just wilt into a puddle if no one looked in her direction every few seconds.  END
BEGIN NOW She would just die.  END
BEGIN NOW IF no one is looking in her direction she’ll make a noise, a cough, a sneeze, clear her throat and say oh it’s nothing, like don’t worry about little ol’ me.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not listening because she doesn’t have to.  END
BEGIN NOW There won’t be a quiz.  END
BEGIN NOW The talk is cheap and the food is garbage and the wine is overpriced old grape juice that was made from bad grapes in a bad year.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is going to admit it.  END
BEGIN NOW If you didn’t pay close attention you’d think everyone was having such a good time.  END
BEGIN NOW You might even think they’re such nice people.  END
BEGIN NOW You’d be wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW These are your friends, and because you think they are your friends you will forgive them over and over again.  END
BEGIN NOW You will believe them when they apologize for missing your birthday, for standing you up on a date, for not showing up to your funeral because of a scheduling conflict. END
BEGIN NOW OUr story teller is a case.  END
BEGIN NOW A case of arrested development.  END
BEGIN NOW a case of the wiggles.  END
BEGIN NOW drinking problem, shaking hands, can’t remember what he’s saying just has to keep talking because when he talks people listen because he keeps talking and if you have something else to say he’ll find something to say too except he will say so much more and keep going on and on about everything he can think of.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks fast, lies fast, his mind working in a frenzy to attach details, to make sense of it in his own mind split seconds before spitting it out, gesturing wildly with his wine glass, making just enough care not to spill it on the table.  END
BEGIN NOW this is wine after all.  END
BEGIN NOW and wine is classy.  END
BEGIN NOW classy people drink wine and it makes them feel important. END
BEGIN NOW further down the table we have a rich widow because every good story needs one.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s mostly quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW Her husband died last year and she hasn’t been happier.  END
BEGIN NOW the old fart finally kicked it and the worst part was how long it took from the start of the dying until he was actually in the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW she thought it would never end.  END
BEGIN NOW laying on his deathbed.  END
BEGIN NOW constantly whining.  END
BEGIN NOW oh my pain.  END
BEGIN NOW oh my suffering.  END
BEGIN NOW god, just shut up and die already.  END
BEGIN NOW the finger her wedding band was on getting thinner every day.  END
BEGIN NOW the ring getting looser.  END
BEGIN NOW she fiddles with it by his death bed.  END
BEGIN NOW spinning it around on her finger.  END
BEGIN NOW the shackle trying to break free.  END
BEGIN NOW just a little longer.  END
BEGIN NOW she can make it.  END
BEGIN NOW she looks at her husband, his skin splotchy and marked, liver spots, and skin getting loose around his bones.  END
BEGIN NOW She can’t wait until this is over.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a little longer and everything he worked for, everything his father worked for, would be hers.  END
BEGIN NOW She earned it by playing nice for the last twenty years.  END
BEGIN NOW she earned it by listening this his complaints about his various illnesses, his allergies, his achy bones, his sore muscles, his paranoid delusions about the maids, his problems with the ethnics, what was happening to his country.  END
BEGIN NOW And she held his hand the whole time, telling him to hush now, feeding him pain killers, letting the nurse feed him because he would drool and dribble the liquified food out of the corners of his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW She couldn’t watch that.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of it she could stomach, but the food coming out again was too much.  END
BEGIN NOW She would leave the room.  END
BEGIN NOW To her credit, she waited until the end to do anything that would be considered inappropriate.  END
BEGIN NOW As soon as he was in the ground, as soon as all the people at the wake were done pretending that they cared, as soon as the other relatives went home, the flowers started dying, the nurse went home for the last time.  END
BEGIN NOW As soon as everything was cleaned up and the staff at the house was replaced.  END
BEGIN NOW the rooms redecorated the way she always wanted but he never did.  END
BEGIN NOW She sent everyone out, she sat down in the study and pulled one of his cigars off the mantle, she cut it with the silver cigar cutter, poured a healthy snifter of his prized presidente brandy, and lit a big fire in the fireplace.  END
BEGIN NOW And his pictures started piling up in the flames, his diploma, his degrees, his awards, all of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything she could find.  END
BEGIN NOW and she sat by the fire, smoking his cigar and drinking his brandy and she spit on the last remainders and reminders of his life. END
BEGIN NOW At the table she wears a lovely evening dress and a tight valium infused smile.  END
BEGIN NOW She just smiles at everyone and doesn’t say much.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s not listening either, she’s just here to make face, as they say.  END
BEGIN NOW to be seen out and about since the ever so unfortunate passing of her dear late husband.  END
BEGIN NOW Late for what? END
BEGIN NOW Late to come to his senses. END
BEGIN NOW There are a few more people at the table.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t care about them.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t care about them.  END
BEGIN NOW No one does.  END
BEGIN NOW they don’t have the capacity.  END
BEGIN NOW Who cares.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re all garbage anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the wine is good. END
BEGIN NOW It’s people like this that make me not believe in government surveillance.  END
BEGIN NOW Because if someone had to listen to these people.  END
BEGIN NOW if someone had to sift through all this human garbage, if you had a job for a government to monitor all the communications in the country looking for signals of treachery, you’d eat a handful of pills, pop a bullet in your head, or take an automatic rifle into a shopping mall on the day after thanksgiving and the sound of the gun and the screaming people running and trying not to die would be the sweetest music.  END
BEGIN NOW if you had to pay attention to other people, you’d be too depressed or pissed off to go on living in a world where this was considered normal. END
BEGIN NOW “are you all finished up here?” the plate is mostly empty and no one has touched anything except the wine for over thirty minutes, but when you’re a busboy you still have to make sure. END
BEGIN NOW “Would you like me to pack this up for you? take it home? yeah? No.  END
BEGIN NOW ok.  END
BEGIN NOW Great.” And around the whole table he goes, trying as hard as possible not to listen to anything they are saying. END
BEGIN NOW He takes the plates to the kitchen and scraps off the uneaten food, throws the silverware into the sink, into a rack ment for the forks and knives and spoons and such.  END
BEGIN NOW He stacks the plates up by size.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight he’s lucky in one respect.  END
BEGIN NOW The dishwasher isn’t an asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a tuesday and Fernando is working and Fernando is not an asshole.  END
BEGIN NOW Jose is an asshole and he works tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Jose yells at the busboy every time he brings him more work to do.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially towards the end of the shift when he’s been drinking since his first job in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s when Jose just gets mean about everything.  END
BEGIN NOW But not tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW Tonight's Fernando.  END
BEGIN NOW And he’s the nicest person in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Fernando has never said anything to the busboy.  END
BEGIN NOW He just smiles because he’s happy to have a job and not have a second family to send the money to.  END
BEGIN NOW Just his mother and sister.  END
BEGIN NOW No wife no kids no worries.  END
BEGIN NOW No worries at the moment.  END
BEGIN NOW Later his mother will get very sick and Fernando will have to work more and send more money and won’t have time to visit until the end when the doctors that didn’t know what they were doing will make a horrible mistake that will cost his mother her life and no one will learn anything from the whole experience. END
BEGIN NOW But that’s not really part of this story. END
BEGIN NOW The busboy scraps the food off the plates and smiles at Fernando he smiles back and they both just want to do their jobs and get paid and go home.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s been a bit of a bullshit tuesday.  END
BEGIN NOW The money’s not going to be great.  END
BEGIN NOW it’ll be enough for a pack of smokes on the way home and can of freeze dried coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW The busboy might even pick up couple of microwaveable sandwiches.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll scrape up whatever leftovers the kitchen is going to relinquish for the night and it might last him until his next shift.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s his weekend and he has so much work to do you wouldn’t even believe it.  END
BEGIN NOW nothing he’s getting paid for, but that’s fine by him.  END
BEGIN NOW there are other things besides money. END
BEGIN NOW he gets off the bus around one in the morning and walks five blocks to his apartment and opens the door to the building and walks up a flight of stairs, he opens his apartment door and turns his screens on.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s going to be another long night and he has a whole new network to explore.  END
BEGIN NOW he brews a pot of coffee and leaves the to go container, still slightly above room temperature on the table.  END
BEGIN NOW he doesn’t sit down until he can pour one cup of coffee and he gets to work. END
BEGIN NOW ok a much better start this time.  END
BEGIN NOW i think we got something going.  END
BEGIN NOW now maintain it and let it breath and give it life and push it around and make everything worse for everyone. END
BEGIN NOW Screens.  END
BEGIN NOW every where he looked there was a screen.  END
BEGIN NOW People with screens in their faces, cabs with screens in the dashboard, screens built into the passenger seat.  END
BEGIN NOW screens mounted next to more screens and flashing pulsing colors and sounds and people talking with background music and sound bites and advertisements.  END
BEGIN NOW everything in full color copyright digital artifacting dripping with dollar signs.  END
BEGIN NOW The screens were inescapable.  END
BEGIN NOW in the subway were more screens, on the buildings there were screens.  END
BEGIN NOW in the buildings, rooms and room from end to end full of them.  END
BEGIN NOW all of them relentlessly broadcasting.  END
BEGIN NOW an endless array of marketing.  END
BEGIN NOW pretty soon they’re going to make it so you can’t turn them off.  END
BEGIN NOW as long as it’s plugged in, always on.  END
BEGIN NOW always there for you, your every need, all your hopes and dreams and desires, one click away, just swipe here, enter your email address, your phone number, your full name, date of birth, last four digits of your social security number.  END
BEGIN NOW city you were born in, name of your first boyfriend, girlfriend, mother’s maiden name, we can’t ask for father’s middle names because half the population doesn’t know that.  END
BEGIN NOW Half the population doesn’t know their father’s first name.  END
BEGIN NOW and we can’t ask a security question that a large group of people can’t answer because there is no answer.  END
BEGIN NOW not even on the birth certificate.  END
BEGIN NOW not one government record because mommy didn’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW for all mommy knows it could have been anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW My old bartender used to joke that she was half Irish and half milkman.  END
BEGIN NOW back when milk men were a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking back, she might have been serious.  END
BEGIN NOW and i wonder how many other people would be serious about that sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW It’s getting worse too.  END
BEGIN NOW Used to be cash or check.  END
BEGIN NOW now it’s cash, check, credit, debit, pay with your phone, email a payment, send a payment over text, set up auto pay, pay when you’re within a ten foot radius of our convenient electronic kiosk.  END
BEGIN NOW you’re pre-approved.  END
BEGIN NOW don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW would you like to auto-complete the checkout form? would you like to save your information with the server for future transactions? would you like to take your paycheck, put it into the bank, take a picture of it and send it to the bank, sign up for direct deposit, all we need is your social security card, your driver's license, a sample of your blood, a voided check so we can copy down the routing number.  END
BEGIN NOW just put your fingers in the ink and press them to this paper.  END
BEGIN NOW don’t worry, we won’t share your personal details with anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Why bother? we give it up to anyone that asks. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what social engineering is? that’s an exploitation of the culture of trust.  END
BEGIN NOW We trust too much.  END
BEGIN NOW we have faith in people to be good.  END
BEGIN NOW we have faith in the company line.  END
BEGIN NOW we have faith that nothing bad will ever happen to us.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re good people we pay our taxes.  END
BEGIN NOW we go to work on time.  END
BEGIN NOW we show up for school.  END
BEGIN NOW We stay in line at the grocery store.  END
BEGIN NOW we stay in line in our cars.  END
BEGIN NOW we stay in line at the voting booths.  END
BEGIN NOW And we cast ballots that say that we’re perfectly ok with everything.  END
BEGIN NOW That all of this is fine with us.  END
BEGIN NOW The system works.  END
BEGIN NOW and the system is working us.  END
BEGIN NOW Make no mistake, you’re going to anyway, there’s no use in me telling you.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re making mistakes right now.  END
BEGIN NOW your phone? the thing you stare at in place of actual human interaction? your social media replacing social interaction? that thing in your purse, in your hands and in your face all day every day is a beacon.  END
BEGIN NOW constantly broadcasting your location, your private details.  END
BEGIN NOW it even has a microphone and a camera on it.  END
BEGIN NOW they don’t even have to try anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW because they sold it to us and we bought it and we love them for it.  END
BEGIN NOW we love them so much that we subscribe to them.  END
BEGIN NOW we shell out more and more every year for the privilege and opportunity to be more connected.  END
BEGIN NOW to share more and more of our selves, pictures of our toast at breakfast, pictures of us trying on pants, selfies with our friends, in front of statues, bathroom selfies, look at me look at me look at me look at my lunch, look at my vacation look at my life my children my family my friends and all the fun we’re having all the time because it’s a nonstop party train and you can watch it all in little chunks and give us likes.  END
BEGIN NOW give us upvotes, give us points.  END
BEGIN NOW validate my existence.  END
BEGIN NOW tell me i’m pretty.  END
BEGIN NOW tell me that looks like fun.  END
BEGIN NOW tell me my sandwich looks delicious and you want a bite.  END
BEGIN NOW tell me that you’re jealous.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m feeding on your envy.  END
BEGIN NOW because at the end of the day, i’m scrolling through the feed to.  END
BEGIN NOW wondering what everyone else is doing.  END
BEGIN NOW wondering what everyone is up to. END
BEGIN NOW you want to know what the government’s top secret super surveillance program is? it’s social media.  END
BEGIN NOW congratulations, suckers.  END
BEGIN NOW you did it to yourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW you coded it, set it free.  END
BEGIN NOW you made the sign up sheets.  END
BEGIN NOW Every day you made it easier.  END
BEGIN NOW and now you’ve created a monster.  END
BEGIN NOW and now the machine has become so big that no one can see it anymore. END
BEGIN NOW it’s only a matter of time before likes become our next form of currency.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s only a matter of time.  END
BEGIN NOW just you wait.  END
BEGIN NOW just watch.  END
BEGIN NOW and whatever you do, don’t stop watching.  END
BEGIN NOW don’t take your eyes off it for a second.  END
BEGIN NOW As soon as you look away, that’s when the predator strikes.  END
BEGIN NOW And believe me honey.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s going right for the neck.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s going to get you right where it counts.  END
BEGIN NOW and it’s not letting go until you and me and everyone we know is little more than a rag doll, limp and lifeless. END
BEGIN NOW I am one of them.  END
BEGIN NOW and so are you.  END
BEGIN NOW so let’s all log in. END
BEGIN NOW Down in what some people call the south china seas, a US naval vessel is cutting a path.  END
BEGIN NOW The ship doesn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW As far as The US of A is concerned it’s all their water anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW not on paper.  END
BEGIN NOW not in loose peace treaty sense.  END
BEGIN NOW they really don’t care when it comes down to.  END
BEGIN NOW if they want to break trail for a shortcut what’s the harm in cutting the line from a to b.  END
BEGIN NOW no harm no foul, right? but that’s not how it’s seen.  END
BEGIN NOW from the perspective of the bully, they allow others to borrow the space.  END
BEGIN NOW from the perspective of everyone else it can look like an act of aggression.  END
BEGIN NOW but when you’re the bully, it doesn’t even matter.  END
BEGIN NOW swatting flies.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s how you see the world.  END
BEGIN NOW pests.  END
BEGIN NOW everything else is just a pest that you have to stop what you’re doing and deal with.  END
BEGIN NOW did it matter that economically, the bully was wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW did it matter that morally, religiously, politically, the bully thinks they’re in the right? only to the bully.  END
BEGIN NOW who makes the rules about this sort of thing? the one with the gun. END
BEGIN NOW survival of the fittest.  END
BEGIN NOW who has the gun.  END
BEGIN NOW if everyone has the gun, who has the biggest gun? when everyone has a big gun, who has the bomb.  END
BEGIN NOW who has the biggest bomb.  END
BEGIN NOW who has the launch codes.  END
BEGIN NOW in a basement under a restaurant in hong kong there’s a group of five guys in their thirties.  END
BEGIN NOW and they have all of those things.  END
BEGIN NOW the launch codes, the means to push the button, a way to null and void every peace talk every awkward talk between world powers.  END
BEGIN NOW five dudes in a basement in hong kong, a loose collective in romania, in russia they’re more spread out, in the USA, it’s all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen year olds living in the attic of grandma’s house, displaced black teens in Chicago’s south side, a large chunk of twenty somethings in New York’s five boroughs.  END
BEGIN NOW A latino hacktivist population that spans from Mexico city to Buenos Aries.  END
BEGIN NOW And in all of these places there’s a belief that they have a piece of the puzzle, a piece of the pie.  END
BEGIN NOW Some semblance of control.  END
BEGIN NOW What they don’t know and you don’t know and no one wants to believe is that, they actually do.  END
BEGIN NOW With one phone call, one email, a text message, the whole thing can be undermined.  END
BEGIN NOW Every vote you’ve ever cast, everything you ever cared about, your savings account, your IRA, your stocks, your shitty studio apartment with the stains in the carpet from the previous tenant's dog, your local dive bar, breakfast joint, sandwich shop.  END
BEGIN NOW the corner store where you get your lotto tickets, and a six pack on a saturday night.  END
BEGIN NOW All of it, gone.  END
BEGIN NOW even if the bomb doesn’t drop.  END
BEGIN NOW even if the trigger doesn’t get pulled.  END
BEGIN NOW the banks and all the numbers could just go away.  END
BEGIN NOW And those pieces of paper in your wallet, if you’re antiquated enough to still do that, what will they be if  o one know how much value they have anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW All of it.  END
BEGIN NOW The deed to your house, your insurance plans, every measure you’ve ever taken to ensure that one day you might be ok.  END
BEGIN NOW something to get you through the last years of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW all of it.  END
BEGIN NOW could in the click of a mouse, in the decisive click of the enter key, be gone.  END
BEGIN NOW Then what do you have.  END
BEGIN NOW do you have survival skills.  END
BEGIN NOW do you have anything to contribute.  END
BEGIN NOW can you grow your own food.  END
BEGIN NOW can you produce electricity.  END
BEGIN NOW is your handwriting legible.  END
BEGIN NOW will you matter anymore? END
BEGIN NOW part of me wants to revisit the board room.  END
BEGIN NOW the company that’s caught up in the middle of the whole situation.  END
BEGIN NOW because that’s real.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s been a thing on the news the last few months.  END
BEGIN NOW Not explicitly.  END
BEGIN NOW but it’s implied.  END
BEGIN NOW Another part of me wants to go all kowloon city bladerunner on this story but i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m thinking too much about other things and that’s kind of a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW too many cats and distractions at home right now, hardly got anything done yesterday and ended up going to sleep, drunk, tired, and mad. END
BEGIN NOW i’m not drunk anymore, but my head sure feels like shit.  END
BEGIN NOW i’ve still got plenty to be mad about though.  END
BEGIN NOW i guess i should do some world building. END
BEGIN NOW It’s been called one of the most dangerous cities in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s small.  END
BEGIN NOW Most people wouldn’t call it a city.  END
BEGIN NOW everything is beige and grey.  END
BEGIN NOW Apartment buildings clumped together in chunks rising from the ground in several stories of state sponsored concrete and rebar.  END
BEGIN NOW everything has this cheap industrialism feel to it.  END
BEGIN NOW windows that are unbroken haven’t been washed in years.  END
BEGIN NOW trash piles up around the edge of the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW the less fortunate scrap together anything that will burn and gather around garbage can fires.  END
BEGIN NOW the town is surrounded by mountains and dense forest.  END
BEGIN NOW there’s not a lot of traffic on the roads.  END
BEGIN NOW almost everything that goes in and out of this places does so on a wire.  END
BEGIN NOW The logging roads are well outside of city limits.  END
BEGIN NOW All of that gets shipped out of the country anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW No one can afford the local lumber.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is building anything new anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW At least, nothing made out of wood.  END
BEGIN NOW Circuit boards, yes. END
BEGIN NOW There’s a guy in forties hunched over a workbench, soldering transistors on a dull green board.  END
BEGIN NOW he keeps his beard trimmed back so he doesn’t set himself on fire.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands work carefully, attaching antennas and sensors.  END
BEGIN NOW This is a prototype, and it’s a contract job.  END
BEGIN NOW The man doesn’t ask more than nessesary questions.  END
BEGIN NOW he knows his work is going to be used for criminal purposes.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows because he’s been in and out of gangs, mobs, you name it.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s just trying to make a living.  END
BEGIN NOW so is everyone else in the town.  END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t worry about the cops here.  END
BEGIN NOW He just pays them once a month as protection money.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, the cops are also customers.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes the bugs they use to extort citizens.  END
BEGIN NOW The cops aren’t interested in locking anyone up, that’s a last resort.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d much rather add someone to the ever growing list of people paying for protection.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lot of people with guns in this town.  END
BEGIN NOW and a lot of people that don’t care about taking life to get whatever they want. END
BEGIN NOW On the floor above him there’s a bunch of kids hanging out, young, mostly male.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re involved in the cities most beloved pastime, drafting scams.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the kids are pretending to be women in various internet forums.  END
BEGIN NOW They are building elaborate stories to convince people around the world to give them money.  END
BEGIN NOW Money for their sick mothers, surgery, plane tickets to come visit.  END
BEGIN NOW And it works more often than you would think.  END
BEGIN NOW A fool and his money, they say. END
BEGIN NOW when it comes down to it, i guess this story is really about trust.  END
BEGIN NOW we, as human beings are so very trusting of each other.  END
BEGIN NOW While we indulge ourselves in crime stories and the nightly news and we all think, that won’t happen to me.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is going to bother to hack my email, no one i know would ever do anything like that.  END
BEGIN NOW we want to believe that people are naturally good natured, that the interests of the individual are outweighed by the collective need, despite there never being any evidence to suggest this was ever a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW We trust our parents, our teachers, our friends, our co-workers.  END
BEGIN NOW we trust the system.  END
BEGIN NOW we trust common institutions like marriage and monogamous relationships.  END
BEGIN NOW we trust ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not trying to play whistleblower here.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m not trying to reinvent the wheel or show you anything that isn’t already out in the open.  END
BEGIN NOW I just want to know why you’re ignoring it.  END
BEGIN NOW what makes everyone think they’re above the law, or above criticism.  END
BEGIN NOW above an audit from the IRS, or profiling at the airport.  END
BEGIN NOW what made us so arrogant as a species that we created all of these things, we created broken systems, and broken methods, and a broken way of life.  END
BEGIN NOW we trust that everything is going to be alright.  END
BEGIN NOW Deep down we all know this isn’t right.  END
BEGIN NOW that it’s only a matter of time.  END
BEGIN NOW Entropy is what i’m getting at.  END
BEGIN NOW The only true thing that eventually, everything is going to break down.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone you know and love will betray you giving the circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW you will lie and betray yourself more often than not.  END
BEGIN NOW A false sense of security is the most prevalent, widely damaging state of mind that we as a species have been cultivating for years.  END
BEGIN NOW we love to kid ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW we overspend, confident that more money will come back to us.  END
BEGIN NOW we make deals on future promises that just because it’s happened before, means it will keep happening.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve tricked ourselves and everyone around us into thinking that we have our shit together.  END
BEGIN NOW Even when we know that every action you make unless you live off the grid completely, makes you just another marketing statistic.  END
BEGIN NOW we look at the world around us so often that we don’t see anything anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW not being able to see the forest for the trees was the old expression.  END
BEGIN NOW I wonder how that will translate after the forests are gone except on old BBC documentaries.  END
BEGIN NOW part of me is truely worried about the future.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of me is scared shitless about the trajectory of the human race.  END
BEGIN NOW The other part of me believes that we deserve every terrible thing that happens.  END
BEGIN NOW Because no matter what, we earned it.  END
BEGIN NOW These things happen because we laid every brick to get there.  END
BEGIN NOW We went from living in caves and later huts with fields of grain, to drawing up maps with lines that made everyone aware of ownership.  END
BEGIN NOW the exact placement of the lines was often disputed, leading to territorial wars, still happening after several hundred years of heavily documented history.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re still pulling the this land is my land, your land is my land card.  END
BEGIN NOW Except the ones claiming ownership are states and institutions and corporations.  END
BEGIN NOW You probably think i’m paranoid, and the old addage holds true that if you think that, you’re not paying attention.  END
BEGIN NOW This is all out in the open.  END
BEGIN NOW IN the last few years, there been a greater lack of denial, because they don’t need to anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW everyone is pretty much ok with it. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know when we all gave up.  END
BEGIN NOW but we did.  END
BEGIN NOW and the it’s too late now bit is also true.  END
BEGIN NOW We can either live with it, or burn it all down and start over.  END
BEGIN NOW I know you’re thinking, but what about all the protests that have happened in the last year? what about all the anger and outrage? what about the activists on Twitter and Facebook, what about the Arab Spring? END
BEGIN NOW Has any of it made a damn bit of difference? I don’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not seeing anything change.  END
BEGIN NOW Same shit, different day.  END
BEGIN NOW you can throw a politician out of office, but if you replace him with another politician, what has been accomplished? nothing has.  END
BEGIN NOW protesting has never accomplished anything and it never will.  END
BEGIN NOW Not until we collectively recognize that the system is broken and we need to start over from scratch.  END
BEGIN NOW draft new laws, new rules and a new system of checks and balances.  END
BEGIN NOW you can’t argue that corruption isn’t present, that it’s not going to happen.  END
BEGIN NOW It will, it always has.  END
BEGIN NOW And until we can figure out a way to do away with the idea of politics, we’ll never be free of it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll get into the militarization of the police force in another rant.  END
BEGIN NOW but i’m starting to fizzle out on this topic.  END
BEGIN NOW I already have a hard to talking to people because everything i say seems so obvious, so repetitive.  END
BEGIN NOW why bother talking? if i have to say obvious things, what’s the point.  END
BEGIN NOW if it’s new to you then you haven’t been listening to anything going in the world around for years, maybe your whole life.  END
BEGIN NOW And i don’t have any faith in you starting because I said something.  END
BEGIN NOW I really don’t know what the point of writing this is anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW this has become an exercise for the the sake of exercise.  END
BEGIN NOW i don’t have a message or a story or a plot or even any clearly defined characters.  END
BEGIN NOW all i have is anger and depression because all i’ve ever done is sit and listen and watch.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i should just write until i’m too tired to be angry anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I know the depression isn’t going to go away anytime soon or ever.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what i’m doing with my life any more.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s getting harder to be happy that i keep waking up.  END
BEGIN NOW Its getting harder to stand in front of the medicine cabinet and not take inventory of what’s there that can finally solve my problems.  END
BEGIN NOW in the terminal sense.  END
BEGIN NOW not that’ll ever do anything about anything ever except maybe get up enough gumption to write about it.  END
BEGIN NOW i’ve always been too much of a pussy to kill myself.  END
BEGIN NOW either way, i’m just pissed off and disgusted with the world around me.  END
BEGIN NOW i have been for a good long time.  END
BEGIN NOW existence makes me sick.  END
BEGIN NOW and i’m having a hard time finding the point of anything anymore. END
BEGIN NOW He noticed the van when he woke up in the afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW it was a big one.  END
BEGIN NOW black and hulking and shiney.  END
BEGIN NOW way too new and clean looking to belong in the neighborhood.  END
BEGIN NOW everything about it was off.  END
BEGIN NOW it gave him what they used to call “the willies”.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what they call it these days, but it’s probably some lyrics in a bad rap song that just repeats until you get some contrived phrase stuck in your head with a metronomic beat in the background to hypnotise you. END
BEGIN NOW He walked back in from the balcony, trying to keep his willies in check.  END
BEGIN NOW He flicked the coffee pot back to life and poured his first cup when it was still cold. END
BEGIN NOW That morning slash last night had been educational, to say the least.  END
BEGIN NOW He had under his control, not only the community college in Ohio, but the state university that was connected to it.  END
BEGIN NOW From the university he was able to get access to several research companies that were contracting free labour from the students.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a long list of damages he could pull off.  END
BEGIN NOW He could very easily bring the whole thing down, but what would be the fun in that? He had access to CEO email accounts, he had the board of directors for the higher education on a string.  END
BEGIN NOW And none of them were the wiser.  END
BEGIN NOW At least for our hero, he’s mostly just curious.  END
BEGIN NOW The only time he uses his powers for what could be called evil, were some skirmishes he had with some kids on a forum when he was much younger.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t do anything really bad.  END
BEGIN NOW Blacklisting their accounts not only on the forums, but with the phone company and the ISP.  END
BEGIN NOW He just wanted them to know that he didn’t appreciate what those kids were up to.  END
BEGIN NOW and he had the power to make it stop.  END
BEGIN NOW All it took was a long night at the keyboard.  END
BEGIN NOW Even as a kid, he was proud of himself for knocking those kids offline, but part of him didn’t sleep well.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of him knew that he was playing with fire.  END
BEGIN NOW And as they say, eventually, you’re going to get burned. END
BEGIN NOW The van hadn’t moved all day.  END
BEGIN NOW He kept tabs on it from the balcony while he would smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW nothing moved, for hours.  END
BEGIN NOW no one went in or out.  END
BEGIN NOW The van was big enough to house two grown men standing upright.  END
BEGIN NOW with enough room for them to park a small car in there.  END
BEGIN NOW Something about it made him nervous.  END
BEGIN NOW His anxiety was usually in check when he was at home, but this foreign element in his neighborhood wasn’t sitting well. END
BEGIN NOW The threw some food in the microwave.  END
BEGIN NOW he didn’t really look at it.  END
BEGIN NOW it was just fuel. END
BEGIN NOW He closed the blinds and turned all the lights off.  END
BEGIN NOW The microwave beeped and he jumped a little bit.  END
BEGIN NOW His nerves were slipping.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it’s nothing he tells himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it’s nothing to worry about, but being a little paranoid wouldn’t hurt.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been engaging in his little hobby at the apartment for a few years now.  END
BEGIN NOW Rent control allowed him not to care about his job.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t one of those people that wanted to move up the later.  END
BEGIN NOW He paid his rent and bills on time.  END
BEGIN NOW Had enough leftover to feed himself and have a pot of coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything else went into his machines.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea of real human interaction beyond what he needed to do at work never really interested him. END
BEGIN NOW When he was a kid, he spent most of his time in the library.  END
BEGIN NOW He liked that library.  END
BEGIN NOW It was quiet and full of books.  END
BEGIN NOW He could read and write and draw dinosaurs.  END
BEGIN NOW His mother would leave him there while she went to work.  END
BEGIN NOW He would wait their after school for her to pick him up.  END
BEGIN NOW The librarians didn’t approve of the practice of parents using the library like a day care.  END
BEGIN NOW But the kid behaved very well.  END
BEGIN NOW He kept to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW never racked up library fines. END
BEGIN NOW When the library got its first computer, he was hooked.  END
BEGIN NOW He learned everything about it.  END
BEGIN NOW When the library computer got wired into the local network, he figured out how to access everything.  END
BEGIN NOW He learned to write simple programs, administer the whole network.  END
BEGIN NOW This was back in the day that when no one except the techs could tell what he was up to.  END
BEGIN NOW The city worker that was responsible for taking care of the network couldn’t figure out where all these changes were coming from.  END
BEGIN NOW After all, he set up the system so that only he should know how to do anything except look up books.  END
BEGIN NOW Security through obscurity never works.  END
BEGIN NOW It does keep anyone out that doesn’t have any creative know how or sense of curiosity.  END
BEGIN NOW But when you’re a kid with a lot of free time and a sense of exploration, it only takes time.  END
BEGIN NOW It took him a week to figure out how the catalog worked.  END
BEGIN NOW It took him another week to figure out how the database of the whole county library users worked.  END
BEGIN NOW he could add and delete fines, he had everyone’s address and phone number.  END
BEGIN NOW He started installing simple games in sub directories, far from prying eyes of anyone that didn’t have access to the logs. END
BEGIN NOW Everything was going fine.  END
BEGIN NOW He grew up at the library and eventually, he got a job there in his formative teenage years.  END
BEGIN NOW He was re-coding a bit of the backend search function and felt someone over his shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW He alt-tabbed out of his program and back to the usual white text on black background of the library system.  END
BEGIN NOW He could dial in from home and work on it later.  END
BEGIN NOW This was back in those days, when you could call up other modems on the phone lines.  END
BEGIN NOW it was easier and a bit more laborious in those days.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting access usually meant knowing little more than what numbers to dial.  END
BEGIN NOW knowing how to navigate a VAX/VMS system. END
BEGIN NOW Heavy breathing, running, turn the corner, duck into the alley, try to catch your breath.  END
BEGIN NOW Their backpacks got heavier with every block.  END
BEGIN NOW They took a risk. END
BEGIN NOW He hadn’t taken his hobby to the physical realm.  END
BEGIN NOW He was pushed there.  END
BEGIN NOW He was way out of his comfort zone.  END
BEGIN NOW All because he was a little careless at work. END
BEGIN NOW “That rent-a-cop is probably going to phone it in, we should lay low for the night.” his companion was like him.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d never met anyone like him.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s how bonds are formed.  END
BEGIN NOW and that’s how trust systems begin.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone is hard wired to trust themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW When you meet someone that reminds you of yourself, you want to believe them.  END
BEGIN NOW Why would you lie to you? END
BEGIN NOW “I know..*inhale* a place *exhale*...  END
BEGIN NOW just a few more blocks… you ready?” END
BEGIN NOW They take off running, trying to get ahead of where ever the real cops might be coming from.  END
BEGIN NOW Dressing in all black is good when you’re not seen, but you tend to stand out when someone is looking for you.  END
BEGIN NOW This wasn’t the food court at the mall.  END
BEGIN NOW This was downtown on a tuesday night. END
BEGIN NOW They stuck to the back alleys as much as possible, winding a path, zig zagging a trail like someone was trying to shoot at them from behind.  END
BEGIN NOW For all they knew, that wasn’t an impossible scenario.  END
BEGIN NOW The neon glow of a chinese restaurant called them home.  END
BEGIN NOW They slipped in the back trying to get out of the way of several giant boiling pots of soup.  END
BEGIN NOW The cooks didn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them were drunk on rice wine and waiting for a moment to squat in the ally for a cigarette. END
BEGIN NOW They pushed through a backdoor.  END
BEGIN NOW and there a kid in his twenties, tattoos on his arm, short hair buzz cut from a few weeks back.  END
BEGIN NOW Table lined with highly caffeinated soda cans, most of them crumpled, ash trays packed with butts, a smell of old laundry and pig parts, cigarette smoke and spills that no one could clean anymore. END
BEGIN NOW “Tran, meet Sawyer, Sawyer say hi to Tran.” Neither of them says hi, but they nod at each other. END
BEGIN NOW “Tran knows more about the phone system then the old guys that repair it.  END
BEGIN NOW He was the first one to build a patch box.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys should get to know each other.” END
BEGIN NOW The guy with the long hair that did a lot of talking takes his backpack off and opens it.  END
BEGIN NOW He pulls stacks of print out and starts laying them out on a table.  END
BEGIN NOW Seeing what that haul produced, if anything. END
BEGIN NOW “Where’d you go tonight, watermark looks familiar.” Tran is helping sift through the pile of perforated edge paper, looking for anything of value. END
BEGIN NOW “we hit the dumpsters behind the post office.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the call center.  END
BEGIN NOW It looks like it’s mostly garbage, but we’ll see.” END
BEGIN NOW “woah woah woah, look at this.” Tran pulls up an inter-office memo.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a list of private dial-ups.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a start.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran sets it aside in the save pile. END
BEGIN NOW “Holy shit! fuckin’ jackpot!” The guy with the long hair pulls up a string of five pages still stuck together with post it notes still attached.  END
BEGIN NOW The notes have some low level account information.  END
BEGIN NOW Maintenance logins.  END
BEGIN NOW If the information is still current, these three guys will have the call center’s guts laid out before them.  END
BEGIN NOW And one call center has enough information in it to exploit several hundred other targets.  END
BEGIN NOW The pages go in the keep file. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer opened his backpack and took out another stack of pages, some of them stuck together, bits of gum, coffee stains, lunch leftovers erasing spots on the cheap printer paper.  END
BEGIN NOW He has the loot from the post office.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s government information in there.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s a felony charge.  END
BEGIN NOW He looks at this stack of paper and wonders how long he could go to jail for raiding the dumpster.  END
BEGIN NOW He tries not to think about it, he wants to look tough in front of his new friends.  END
BEGIN NOW He wants them to think he does this kind of stuff all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Flashback time.----- END
BEGIN NOW He alt-tabbed out of the program he was writing. END
BEGIN NOW “That’s some tight looking code you got there.  END
BEGIN NOW do they know what you’re doing?” END
BEGIN NOW A kid with hair down past his shoulders, a black leather studded jacket, ripped jeans, dirt and ketchup stains.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer doesn’t know what to say.  END
BEGIN NOW No one ever knows what he’s doing.  END
BEGIN NOW and he doesn’t bother anyone about what they’re doing. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey man, don’t worry, i won’t tell anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW He brushes his hair back from his thin face.  END
BEGIN NOW he reaches out a hand looking for a shake and an introduction.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’m Cut.  END
BEGIN NOW what’s your name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Sawyer,” he says apprehensively shaking the grunge punk’s hand. END
BEGIN NOW “That your birth name?” cut shakes his hand and laughs.  END
BEGIN NOW “They call me Cut, but i post as Ctrl-X.  END
BEGIN NOW What do you post as? maybe i’ve seen your work before.” Cut is sitting in a chair that’s backwards because he saw the character John Bender do it in The Breakfast Club.  END
BEGIN NOW he figured that’s how a bad ass sits. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t post anywhere,” Sawyer says.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows what Cut is talking about, kind of.  END
BEGIN NOW He works too much to think about sharing or interacting with other people.  END
BEGIN NOW Until earlier that year, he thought he was pretty much isolated.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t know that he was part of a small group of kids that caught the bug same as him.  END
BEGIN NOW They saw this new tech and fell into it, hard. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, shit, ain’t that a shame.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s no time to be going solo.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a big world out there, just waiting for people like us.” People like us, Sawyer thought.  END
BEGIN NOW How many of ‘us’ are there? he didn’t say a thing. END
BEGIN NOW “Look, i know that talking must not be your thing.  END
BEGIN NOW you’re an action guy, right? you need a keyboard and a problem to fix.  END
BEGIN NOW You need a puzzle, yeah? that’s cool, i get it.  END
BEGIN NOW Hey look, you wanna see something cool?” How many times has this happened? You wanna see something cool has started so many relationships, lead so many kids down a rabbit hole.  END
BEGIN NOW Who doesn’t want to see something cool.  END
BEGIN NOW We as a species are curious by nature, cautious by exposure. END
BEGIN NOW Cut slides his chair in front of the computer.  END
BEGIN NOW He alts in to the console and within a few minutes, the library computer is talking to the local university.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s logged in on a backdoor account he made the day before. END
BEGIN NOW “Check this out,” he says, typing furious and sloppy.  END
BEGIN NOW Hitting more keys then he should in his excitement to show off. END
BEGIN NOW The screen pulls up the university mail server and lists the mailbox for every department, every professor, and the privileged few students that were allowed access. END
BEGIN NOW “Woah…” Sawyer’s eyes went wide. END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, cool stuff, right? This is some heavy metal here.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re running UNIX on a small Beowulf cluster.  END
BEGIN NOW I just found this address yesterday.” He types a few more commands and he’s pulled up software they’re working on in a partnership with an aeronautics company out in California. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m not totally sure what they’re working on, but it’s some high level shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I think it’s got something to do with satellites, or something.” Sawyer looked at the code and tried to follow.  END
BEGIN NOW Even with his obsessive nature, his constant study, this was way over his head.  END
BEGIN NOW The math was something he had never seen before. END
BEGIN NOW “Pretty fuckin’ cool, yeah? I don’t know what it does, but i bet there’s a bunch of people that want to keep it a secret.” A stranger walks into the room and Cut closes out and gets the screen back to the libraries search catalog.  END
BEGIN NOW “This place is getting too crowded for me, you smoke?” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer didn’t smoke, but he was impressed and intimidated and had never met anyone like Cut before. END
BEGIN NOW “yeah, sure.” They went outside.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they started hanging out.  END
BEGIN NOW And then things would escalate. END
BEGIN NOW An alert popped up on the screen indicating a new Email.  END
BEGIN NOW In a very dangerous town in Romania, the message is opened and a contract is negotiated.  END
BEGIN NOW A target is established.  END
BEGIN NOW A payment system is set up and a deadline is argued upon.  END
BEGIN NOW The price is very high.  END
BEGIN NOW The work is dangerous enough that one wrong move will bring in the international authorities.  END
BEGIN NOW No one wants that.  END
BEGIN NOW But in the event that the job is compromised, everyone will disavow all knowledge.  END
BEGIN NOW A fire will wipe out as much evidence as the preliminary data wipe might leave behind.  END
BEGIN NOW Everything is conducted over the dark web.  END
BEGIN NOW The dark web at the top layer, refers to the spidered, uncataloged addresses of the internet.  END
BEGIN NOW A level deeper are networks like Tor, and I2P.  END
BEGIN NOW Networks that operate much the same as the internet we all know and love, but with the except that if you don’t know about it, you can’t get there.  END
BEGIN NOW It will never show up on a search engine.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t even see it unless you know how to route your internet connection through the right channels.  END
BEGIN NOW In essence, the dark web is a vast, virtual private network.  END
BEGIN NOW If you don’t know how to look for it, you’ll never be able to find it.  END
BEGIN NOW By using encrypted channels, aliases, globe trotting routes, it’s virtually impossible to get traced back to the real world.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless you do something stupid, like check your personal clearnet email.  END
BEGIN NOW Log onto your bank account.  END
BEGIN NOW Associate anything you do on the dark web with your real life self.  END
BEGIN NOW All it takes is one fuck up.  END
BEGIN NOW One fuck up and someone watching what you’re doing.  END
BEGIN NOW And best believe that in the world of high tech law enforcement, they can see anything you do if you don’t take the right precautions. END
BEGIN NOW The contract was a pretty simple plan with some high stakes risks.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a senator in the US, trying to get a bill passed.  END
BEGIN NOW Take him out.  END
BEGIN NOW When they talk about taking someone out in a digital age, we’re not talking about killing them.  END
BEGIN NOW Messy, too easy.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re talking about ruining someone’s life.  END
BEGIN NOW Discrediting.  END
BEGIN NOW Drag him through the mud.  END
BEGIN NOW Make him look like an animal.  END
BEGIN NOW Or better yet, expose him for the filth he is.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not the most difficult thing to do with politicians.  END
BEGIN NOW They all have some skeletons in the closet.  END
BEGIN NOW Something they don’t want the public to see.  END
BEGIN NOW And most of them aren’t the tech savvy types they want us to believe.  END
BEGIN NOW We suffer from thinking the people we elect are smart enough to do their jobs, and more than that.  END
BEGIN NOW We like to think in a post watergate world, in a post scandal after scandal world, that these people might learn something.  END
BEGIN NOW And we’re constantly proven wrong. END
BEGIN NOW The job was a no brainer for the den in Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW These guys were vets.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d been doing this since they were kids and the Wall was still up.  END
BEGIN NOW The money, held in escrow, in encryption until proof of the job’s completion, was enough to upgrade everyone’s rig in the den.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough to get a new heater installed for the coming winter.  END
BEGIN NOW And enough for a night of celebration with bottle service at their favorite all night club.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough for them all to buy some companions for the night. END
BEGIN NOW He agrees and begins phase one: research. END
BEGIN NOW The boardroom doors close and most of the people present have a trajectory lined out. END
BEGIN NOW “Smyth, a minute of your time, please.” END
BEGIN NOW “Sure, sir, what’s up?” She’s one of five women at the company and knows that she’s been outnumbered in this room and in most rooms she’s ever been in. END
BEGIN NOW “I want to make sure you know that you’re appreciated.  END
BEGIN NOW Right? you know that? you know i’d never single you out, yeah? I just want to let you know, at these meetings, it’s a matter of credibility, yeah? it’s just we’re all taking time out of our days to try and get everyone on the same page.  END
BEGIN NOW You know what i mean, right? do you see where i’m going with this? No one wants to have the air filled with the obvious.  END
BEGIN NOW No one wants to hear anything that we can put out in the email later on.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just that we don’t have time for repetition.  END
BEGIN NOW These guys that come from the fifth floor.  END
BEGIN NOW they’re busy people.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t want to hear things they don’t understand.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t have time for that.  END
BEGIN NOW They just want results.  END
BEGIN NOW Just the facts and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW So if you could.  END
BEGIN NOW Just stick to the script, yeah? Just try to keep it, what do they say? on the down low.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d rather you kept more notes.  END
BEGIN NOW Just be a face they can look at when they’re bored? alright? not a problem, right.  END
BEGIN NOW ok good.  END
BEGIN NOW Good talk.” END
BEGIN NOW Sophia walked out of the board room and tried not to let her anger get the best of her.  END
BEGIN NOW She tried not to let everyone she saw know that everything she’d ever worked for was turning into a problem because as they never let her forget, she was a woman, she had a vagina, and that was a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t a problem for her, really, it was a problem for them.  END
BEGIN NOW The boys had a hard time working when she was around.  END
BEGIN NOW They often didn’t type as fast.  END
BEGIN NOW They looked up too much.  END
BEGIN NOW or looked down too much when she was around.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW She was a problem.  END
BEGIN NOW She tried and was ambitious.  END
BEGIN NOW She made a noise.  END
BEGIN NOW and when you make a noise, you became a problem at the old boys club.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not talking about the political one.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m talking about the tech club.  END
BEGIN NOW The old boys that have been at this since the beginning.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones with beards and last week’s shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones that never take her seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW Never treat her like she’s a boss, or sorts.  END
BEGIN NOW At least it says so on her business card.  END
BEGIN NOW And they’ve never worried about business cards.  END
BEGIN NOW They don’t have to.  END
BEGIN NOW Their names are all over the community.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re found more 0 Day bugs then the rest of the world combined.  END
BEGIN NOW That was how this company got where it did.  END
BEGIN NOW It cherry picked the best of the best.  END
BEGIN NOW and when it couldn’t get them to come over, they just bought the company they were working for.  END
BEGIN NOW it didn’t matter.  END
BEGIN NOW They wanted a best of.  END
BEGIN NOW They wanted a greatest hits album.  END
BEGIN NOW They expected Sophia to be able to wrangle them, and simultaneously keep quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW a low profile.  END
BEGIN NOW She had to be an authority figure that didn’t get in their way.  END
BEGIN NOW She never knew how that was ever suppose to work.  END
BEGIN NOW she did know this company.  END
BEGIN NOW She did know the importance of the job.  END
BEGIN NOW She did know that she could freeze a cold war before the general public got wind of it.  END
BEGIN NOW And that was the unspoken elephant in the room that kept her there.  END
BEGIN NOW The higher ups knew she could handle the negotiations.  END
BEGIN NOW They knew she could take being held hostage with a gun to her head and not give anyone a word.  END
BEGIN NOW They knew she was thick skinned and tough like a wall.  END
BEGIN NOW But respect? Treat her like an equal? She was a woman for christ’s sake.  END
BEGIN NOW What did she really know about computers. END
BEGIN NOW A goddamn hell of a lot. END
BEGIN NOW Her father worked at Lawrence Livermoore during the first space race.  END
BEGIN NOW She was private schooled and schooled further at home.  END
BEGIN NOW Her life was high level machine code.  END
BEGIN NOW She breathed it.  END
BEGIN NOW She remembered when her father came home for months, distraught because one of the system admins had noticed there were traces of foreigners in the system.  END
BEGIN NOW Later she learned they were spies from East Germany.  END
BEGIN NOW A group of kids.  END
BEGIN NOW They had managed to break into the labs computers from behind the iron curtain.  END
BEGIN NOW She saw her father going through the stress of being attacked by an unknown enemy.  END
BEGIN NOW An enemy they learned later hardly knew what they were doing.  END
BEGIN NOW A bunch of kids on amphetamines and cocaine, working for the mob.  END
BEGIN NOW Degenerates.  END
BEGIN NOW She was twelve years old and she never forgot it.  END
BEGIN NOW She vowed then and there that she didn’t want to see this kind of thing go any further. END
BEGIN NOW And now here she was.  END
BEGIN NOW Wrangler to a bunch of the same.  END
BEGIN NOW The same kind of kids, now grown up, employed to keep the new kids from doing what they did as kids.  END
BEGIN NOW Information Security is a strange business.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes a kid will hack through.  END
BEGIN NOW Will get past everything and beat the end boss.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them did see it as a video game.  END
BEGIN NOW The metaphor is apt.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d get to the end and think they’d win a job.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead most of them ended up in jail.  END
BEGIN NOW The old computer fraud and abuse act took care of that.  END
BEGIN NOW A catch all law from the early days that let lawyers throw anyone in jail even for an accident.  END
BEGIN NOW For assumed company loss.  END
BEGIN NOW When Robert Morris crashed several hundred computers on accident before he was a teenager, because he was smarter then the people that wrote the code he accidentally exploited, he created a generation of fear.  END
BEGIN NOW Kids are too smart.  END
BEGIN NOW And they’re going to bring down the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW The power grid, the water systems, traffic lights.  END
BEGIN NOW you name it.  END
BEGIN NOW Some kid behind a computer.  END
BEGIN NOW the worst enemy.  END
BEGIN NOW He scared the shit out of everyone that heard the news.  END
BEGIN NOW If he can bring down the whole scientific community with one program, what’s going to happen when the russians figure this out? They have whole teams dedicated to it.  END
BEGIN NOW and an 22 year old managed to do from his dorm room.  END
BEGIN NOW That was the real turning point during the first cold war.  END
BEGIN NOW When the top brass realized that no matter how many nukes they had stock piled, everything could be taken out by a kid with a keyboard.  END
BEGIN NOW The older military didn’t get it.  END
BEGIN NOW The older politicians didn't get it.  END
BEGIN NOW But NASA did.  END
BEGIN NOW The Aerospace labs did.  END
BEGIN NOW The geeks all over the country understood right from the bat.  END
BEGIN NOW And Sophia’s father was right in the thick of it.  END
BEGIN NOW And she watched it kill him.  END
BEGIN NOW She saw him get a little more tired every day.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole concept was so hopeless.  END
BEGIN NOW It crushed him.  END
BEGIN NOW She’d be damned if it crushed her too.  END
BEGIN NOW And so her days went.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking at these geeks, separated by sudo partitions.  END
BEGIN NOW Thinking they were the hottest shit on the scene.  END
BEGIN NOW She knew what a kid could do.  END
BEGIN NOW That they could see right between their legs.  END
BEGIN NOW A kid could hit them were it counted.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a part of her that wanted to see their faces when that happened.  END
BEGIN NOW There was another part of her that never wanted to see that happen ever again. END
BEGIN NOW This story is a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW I admited that from the beginnging.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know where i’m going with it.  END
BEGIN NOW there’s no ending in sight.  END
BEGIN NOW but i wanted to write a cyberpunk thriller.  END
BEGIN NOW so far that hasn’t been accomplished at all.  END
BEGIN NOW The tech details are boring as hell.  END
BEGIN NOW they always will be.  END
BEGIN NOW you can’t really convey the excitment of someone having as many scans in terminals open on a screen.  END
BEGIN NOW Waiting that one of them will scrolled down with a little mark that means we’ve found a vulnerability.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s boring as hell to anyone that doesn’t get it.  END
BEGIN NOW and granted, the people that get are probably too busy doing it to ever read this kind of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s like script kiddie fan fiction anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW but who cares.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s nano.  END
BEGIN NOW and i’m not going to stress about it.  END
BEGIN NOW the whole point of playing this year was to get in the habit of typing, of settting time aside to write something.  END
BEGIN NOW if i want to chunk out sci-fi shit set in current time when most of it isn’t fiction, but science fact, that’s my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW you want to write a tech thriller based on the giant mess that is Anonymous? be my fucking guest.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure it will make the movies someday.  END
BEGIN NOW And everyone involved will get hacked because of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Production by Michael Bay.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure everyone in Hollywood is stroking their dicks wanting to make that movie and at the same time too scared too.  END
BEGIN NOW Anon has too much power because we all believe they have too much power.  END
BEGIN NOW Not far from the police forces of the world that they engage in these little tet a tets with.  END
BEGIN NOW And if Hollywood gets majorly hacked.  END
BEGIN NOW Like crippled hacked.  END
BEGIN NOW well, that’d really get some new laws put in, some military police.  END
BEGIN NOW more raids, more vans outside people’s houses.  END
BEGIN NOW More TPP style international aggreements.  END
BEGIN NOW Every action of protest, every dissent, has a reprocussion in more guns for cops.  END
BEGIN NOW more laws to send the loud people to jail.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why i started writing this.  END
BEGIN NOW It has my curiousity.  END
BEGIN NOW It always has.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of me wishes i had the time and energy to stick with it though the years, i’d be making a lot more money to sit on my ass.  END
BEGIN NOW i know that much.  END
BEGIN NOW instead i went off and cooked for ten years, took everything for granted, had a bunch of drug trips, got fucked up on shit booze for ten years, broke as many friendships as i made and now here i am, with a broken foot, afraid to leave the house most of the time, more afraid to actually talk to people.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t even talk to people on the internet anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside from less than five of the people i know.  END
BEGIN NOW The less than five of the people i would actually call friends despite the number I have attached to me via social media.  END
BEGIN NOW Funny that.  END
BEGIN NOW how that all works and how we all know it.  END
BEGIN NOW oh, i have 30-50 likes out of the 500 people that claim to be friends via social media.  END
BEGIN NOW sometimes it’s only 5 likes.  END
BEGIN NOW why do i bother sharing anything.  END
BEGIN NOW why does anyone share anything except distraction videos of baby animals being uncoordinated.  END
BEGIN NOW Why do we bother trying to say anything that means anything when we know that the majority of people we grew up with, the people we know are scrolling down the feed every day don’t even care.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we use the feed to distract us.  END
BEGIN NOW We use all the feeds to take us away from the shit and the mundane deary lives we all lead.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter how successful you are.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter all the hiking, biking, yachting, adventuring whatever you’re going on, you’re taking time out of your trip to post a picture or scroll down a feed of your friends and their problems and triumphs and success.  END
BEGIN NOW and the whole experience is just cheapened.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole thing is just another spectacle.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s like channel surfing at three in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW We send each other emoji.  END
BEGIN NOW we send smiley faces that frown because we don’t know how to express sadness anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW We give each other thumbs ups.  END
BEGIN NOW likes.  END
BEGIN NOW upvotes.  END
BEGIN NOW Because we want to acknowledge each other’s success’s.  END
BEGIN NOW we want to be able to say, good job on getting that job and having that kid and getting married even though i couldn’t be there for any of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Good on you and your life.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry i missed the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW here’s a sticker.  END
BEGIN NOW Please remember me when you’re famous. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t mean to bring you down about this.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, kind of.  END
BEGIN NOW It is a cheapening of the human experience.  END
BEGIN NOW It is the downfall of humanity.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyone scared of robots taking over the human race? they’ve got a head start.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re already robots.  END
BEGIN NOW And we’re programmed not to care about it.  END
BEGIN NOW And until it crashes down our front doors or turns off our power or cuts the switch for our connection, we’re not going to care about it.  END
BEGIN NOW we’re going to keep on posting and fishing for compliments.  END
BEGIN NOW we’re going to keep on scrolling past our friends with cancer, looking for a dollar from each of you that will help them with the bill.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve already become desensitized to the guy on the corner just trying to get a sandwich.  END
BEGIN NOW Doing the same thing on facebook, despite your disease doesn’t make a lick of difference. END
BEGIN NOW We’re a sick people.  END
BEGIN NOW The more i pay attention to it, the more obvious it gets.  END
BEGIN NOW We deserve to get nuked.  END
BEGIN NOW we took the limitless human potential and what did we do with it? We made sitcoms.  END
BEGIN NOW We made the NFL.  END
BEGIN NOW we made the glorious two party three branched system of super democracy that’s not really anything to do with the actual people that have to live here.  END
BEGIN NOW We are the great human experiment.  END
BEGIN NOW And we’re failing.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyday we fail even more.  END
BEGIN NOW For every moon landing, every Martin Luther King Jr, every cure, we have thousands of new lies, new Hitlers, new diseases.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re fighting a losing battle.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re fighting ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why i wanted to write in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW Because the more i pay attention, the more hopeless everything becomes.  END
BEGIN NOW The more i understand the get doped up and tune out ethos of Leary.  END
BEGIN NOW I know that wasn’t his mission, but that’s what he achieved.  END
BEGIN NOW Comfortably Numb.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what booze and sex and drugs and violence had achieved.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what politics and television and even the great books, the hundreds of venerable authors ever really did.  END
BEGIN NOW Create bookworms.  END
BEGIN NOW A bunch of smug fucks.  END
BEGIN NOW They do nothing and think they know everything.  END
BEGIN NOW We the people.  END
BEGIN NOW if only there was a god to help us all.  END
BEGIN NOW because goddamn, could we use a god right about now. END
BEGIN NOW “Mr. President?”  END
BEGIN NOW A man in a suit in the Oval Office is laying down on the most exculsive carpet in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been passed out for a few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW The wrikles on his suit have formed creases crossing the threads.  END
BEGIN NOW He hasn’t shaved since his last television appearance. END
BEGIN NOW “Mr. President?!” A man is standing half way in the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s looking for the president. END
BEGIN NOW If i don’t move, maybe he’ll look somewhere else, thought Mr. President.   END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he’ll leave me alone today.  END
BEGIN NOW He lies very still, trying to regulate his breathing and play dead. END
BEGIN NOW The man at the door pokes around as much as he can without fully entering the room.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s not allowed to go all the way in unless he’s invited.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President knows he can’t be seen as long as he doesn’t move from behind his spot under the desk. END
BEGIN NOW “Goddamnit.” The man leaves and closes the door. END
BEGIN NOW “Thank god,” is what Mr. President would say.  END
BEGIN NOW He knows the office is bugged.  END
BEGIN NOW Today he just wants to lie on the ground and not talk to anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting time to yourself is important.  END
BEGIN NOW As The Most Powerful Man in The World, it’s really hard for him to get a break.  END
BEGIN NOW And that was today.  END
BEGIN NOW Break day.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone can take a hike.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President opens a drawer in the desk and takes out some painkillers and a flask of brandy.  END
BEGIN NOW Not today, he thinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Not after this terrible, long week. END
BEGIN NOW It started with the meetings.  END
BEGIN NOW His week always started with the meetings.  END
BEGIN NOW He hated every minute of them.  END
BEGIN NOW He had to listen to all of them talk, and talk.  END
BEGIN NOW And they just never shut up.  END
BEGIN NOW He had advisors for this reason.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a cabinet.  END
BEGIN NOW They were supposed to handle all of the gritty stuff.  END
BEGIN NOW They were supposed to just tell him where to sign, what to sign, write his speeches, tell him where to go and what to do.  END
BEGIN NOW He just had to put on his suit, pin his American Flag on the jacket, and smile.  END
BEGIN NOW He was sick of it.  END
BEGIN NOW It made him feel like bombing something.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t even care.  END
BEGIN NOW If he could turn on the news and watch a town somewhere burning, citizens running in a panic.  END
BEGIN NOW And the screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW The beautiful screaming.  END
BEGIN NOW He would smile that famous Time Magazine cover smile.  END
BEGIN NOW He would sleep soundly at night. END
BEGIN NOW He tips the flask and there’s not much left.  END
BEGIN NOW He eats a few pills, chewing them.  END
BEGIN NOW He washes it down with a hundred and fifty year old brandy.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President puts his head back down on the carpet and closes his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Mr. President we have reports coming in from the Ukraine, and Romania, there’s a lot of data going over the wires, sir.” One of the advisors says.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President looks straight ahead and nods. END
BEGIN NOW “We have reason to believe that there may be some rogue ex-KGB that have organized a small army, all of them with proficient cyber crime histories and backgrounds in espionage.” END
BEGIN NOW The president turns to someone else at the table, looking for a cue. END
BEGIN NOW “Can we send in a team? Don’t we have some special forces that can just go in there and bring these bastards in? or just kill them? Can’t we just kill them?” The military advisor shines one of his medals with the sleeve of his shirt.  END
BEGIN NOW The president liked him.  END
BEGIN NOW He always wanted to take action. END
BEGIN NOW “We can’t just waltz in and kill whoever we want outside of the country.” A woman in a smart conservative suit says.  END
BEGIN NOW “We can’t afford another Iraq, or another Cuba, or shall i go on?” She doesn’t.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the people shift uncomfortably as soon as she starts talking.  END
BEGIN NOW She sits on the council for foreign affairs, she’s worked with the U.N.  END
BEGIN NOW She’s a huge buzzkill to most of these meetings.  END
BEGIN NOW “We have to find another way to solve this before it gets out of hand.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t want this government to be seen as incompetent as that cheating website that got taken down.” More uncomfortable shifting.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President is trying not to roll his eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW The drug cocktail he took earlier is starting to wear off.  END
BEGIN NOW He’ll talk with his military friend over scotch and cigars later.  END
BEGIN NOW Away from little miss world peace and the rest of these mouth breathers.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe play some golf with the heads of the NSA and CIA tomorrow.  END
BEGIN NOW Sort this business out like they used to. END
BEGIN NOW “Do we know what they’re targeting?” Mr. President asks. END
BEGIN NOW “and do we have a solid lock on their location?” END
BEGIN NOW “They’re seem to be coming in from all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Everytime we try to pinpoint anything they disappear and the signal starts coming from somewhere else.  END
BEGIN NOW As for the targets, it’s damn near everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole infrastructure of the law enforcement branch of country.  END
BEGIN NOW We haven’t detected any breaks yet, but it’s only a matter of time before something breaks.  END
BEGIN NOW They must have hundreds of people working on this operation.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright, set up a meeting with The Nerds.  END
BEGIN NOW This meeting is wasting my time.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a very busy man.” Some nervous fidgeting all around the table.  END
BEGIN NOW When the president wanted to talk to The Nerds that meant the spooks that watch over everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Top brass from the CIA, FBI, NSA, and a handful of smaller operations that were deemed very, very, classified even to most of the people in this room. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President gets up from the table and everyone else stands up while he buttons his jacket and starts to walk out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW He’s snoring lightly and the carpets fabric is making a soft inlay on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreams of bombs dropping everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreams of a world on fire. END
BEGIN NOW trying to focus on the writing, but it seems i’ve come down with a sickness in the face.  END
BEGIN NOW not the best time.  END
BEGIN NOW so it’s sad piano music and coconut water and hoping i don’t swallow too much muscas and sick up all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s also much colder today and we got some rain.  END
BEGIN NOW that was nice.  END
BEGIN NOW But i’ve been in bed the whole time, so what of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Could barely write yesterday but today i’m making a late start, but a start nonetheless.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know about plot or anything tho.  END
BEGIN NOW We have… let's see… END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer and Cut and Tran, We have the nameless, faceless Romanians and Ukrainians, The US government.  END
BEGIN NOW The citizens.  END
BEGIN NOW And i’m doing all this from memory because i don’t want to read anything back yet.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll just get stuck and suckered into trying to edit.  END
BEGIN NOW and WE can’t go there yet.  END
BEGIN NOW not for 21 more days.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s hope i can get something done.  END
BEGIN NOW And i don’t know where to take this, really.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone has to get in trouble.  END
BEGIN NOW that has to be next.  END
BEGIN NOW i can’t put that off any longer.  END
BEGIN NOW We should finish the flashback first.  END
BEGIN NOW that’ll set up the next few dominos.  END
BEGIN NOW let’s go there. END
BEGIN NOW In a room in the back of a chinese restarraunt, three kids are drinking highly caffinated sodas from the can and huddled around a screen.  END
BEGIN NOW Cut is at the keyboard and he works manically, in fits and bursts of inspiration.  END
BEGIN NOW An unlit cigarette dangling out of his mouth.  END
BEGIN NOW He stops to brush his hair out of the way every few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW His fingers, tinted with tabacco on the tips, clacking madly at the dirty keyboard.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the late 1990s. END
BEGIN NOW “They won’t even see this one coming.” he grins and lights the cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW “Tag, you’re in.” he swivels his chair out of the way and Sawyer cracks his knuckles.  END
BEGIN NOW They were getting deep into a subsystem that was linked to the post office mainframe.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of what they found was garbage.  END
BEGIN NOW Notes, meetings, nothing worth while.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer prods his way around the directories, looking for privilege escalation.  END
BEGIN NOW The heap of papers they dug up allowed them to recover a long forgotten maintenance account.  END
BEGIN NOW The access level was enough to get around the post office system, and just enough to leapfrog to whatever they were in now.  END
BEGIN NOW He finds a list of employees and saves it to their local disk.  END
BEGIN NOW That could come in handy later.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran swivels his chair around, looking up from the bit of phone equipment he was rewiring.  END
BEGIN NOW He was the oldest one there, and the quietest.  END
BEGIN NOW Every good group needs a phone and hardware guy and that was Tran.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer could handle the software end of things and Cut, he was a smooth talking drink of of long haired, tech saavy charisma.  END
BEGIN NOW He could talk anyone out of all the information he wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew all the jargon, but most of all he knew a few magicians tricks, a little sleight of hand, a little misdirection.  END
BEGIN NOW He could walk into an office build with nothing but a collared shirt and an old tie.  END
BEGIN NOW A few hours later he would have the dial up numbers, the login credentials and sometimes a date with one of the secretaries.  END
BEGIN NOW They were in those days, a power trio of geeks.  END
BEGIN NOW A small group of twenty-somethings that had access to information most people went about their daily lives blissfully ignorant of. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer enters a command and the screen fills up with text.  END
BEGIN NOW A small flood of output.  END
BEGIN NOW Then it stops and the cursor changes.  END
BEGIN NOW He types two letters and hits return again. END
BEGIN NOW # id END
BEGIN NOW (0) root END
BEGIN NOW “Hey guys…” END
BEGIN NOW Tran looks up and Cut wheels over.  END
BEGIN NOW “Holy shit, dude… you did it.” END
BEGIN NOW They stare at the screen for a few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW looking at that all significant, all powerfull 0.  END
BEGIN NOW They had complete control of the system, whatever it was.  END
BEGIN NOW The next task at hand was to create a backdoor account with the same level of access.  END
BEGIN NOW Then cover their tracks. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer takes a smoke break now.  END
BEGIN NOW The hardest part is over.  END
BEGIN NOW Cut takes the wheel, he wants to see what this machine can do.  END
BEGIN NOW He goes through the superuser files, grabs the encrypted account files, the list of connected hosts, and sees something he hasn’t seen before.  END
BEGIN NOW He pokes around more.  END
BEGIN NOW Source code, most of it very complex, heavy math. END
BEGIN NOW “Found some things you might want to take a look at later,” he turns to Sawyer.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer is just smiling still, and putting out the end of his cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I think i need a minute, maybe some air.  END
BEGIN NOW You guys need anything from the corner store?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, get me some licorice.  END
BEGIN NOW And another six pack of soda.” END
BEGIN NOW “Hey Tran, you need anything from the shop?” He shakes his head and goes back to his soldering iron. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer puts his jacket on and steps out of the restaurant into the crisp evening air.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s got the after glow he’s been feeling a lot lately, since hanging out at the restaurant with Cut and Tran.  END
BEGIN NOW The feeling of accomplishment after making a big break.  END
BEGIN NOW Being in that back room with all the smoke and soda, Cut’s taste in Scandinavian metal music, the smells of the restaurant wafting in, it was starting to feel normal.  END
BEGIN NOW He was starting to feel at home and accepted for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer walked out of the corner store with a plastic bag with the sodas and snacks and cigarettes.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to spend just a little more time in the fresh air before heading back to the cave.  END
BEGIN NOW The cool air felt good on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW He reached into his pocket and took out a smoke.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked up after he lit it, that’s when he noticed the van.  END
BEGIN NOW Had that been there before? He couldn’t remember.  END
BEGIN NOW There were plenty of white vans around town.  END
BEGIN NOW It was probably just a repairman. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the restaurant, on both stories of the building, the power goes out.  END
BEGIN NOW “Aw fuck!” Cut says, “I hope we got everything saved.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran looks out of a small window near the ceiling to see what’s going on.  END
BEGIN NOW The door to the room is kicked down and within seconds the room is flooded with armed and armored cops. END
BEGIN NOW “Go go go!” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh what the fuck!” Cut is yelling and scrambling but there’s nowhere to go.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran doesn’t move.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s probably going to get beaten for resisting arrest either way.  END
BEGIN NOW But he won’t make it worse.  END
BEGIN NOW He grew up hearing stories of what the cops would do to the other Asians in town.  END
BEGIN NOW If he sat still and complied, at least they couldn’t justify shooting him.  END
BEGIN NOW A cop tackles him to the ground and punches him across his face.  END
BEGIN NOW He has his wrists in cuffs and an elbow in his back.  END
BEGIN NOW Cut is kicking and screaming and trying to get free.  END
BEGIN NOW The two cops push him on the ground and he gets the same treatment.  END
BEGIN NOW A punch in the face to let him know who’s in charge here.  END
BEGIN NOW And the cuffs, to keep him from using his hands. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer sees the lights are out from across the street and he gets a twitch of that animal instinct.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that tells him he’d better watch his back, that maybe he should run.  END
BEGIN NOW he stays on his side of the street. END
BEGIN NOW The cops shine lights over the room. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh shit, it’s just a couple of kids.” END
BEGIN NOW “A couple of kids that are in some really deep shit.” one of the cops leafs through the papers on the table, sees all the technical equipment laying around, understands none of it except his orders. END
BEGIN NOW “Load them up, then we’ll clean up this mess.” END
BEGIN NOW “You fucking pigs! you can’t do this! I have rights!” END
BEGIN NOW “You ain’t got shit now, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Get them out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to get this over with.” END
BEGIN NOW The cops haul Tran and Cut out of the restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the cooks have taken off running, afraid they might get tapped for expired visas.  END
BEGIN NOW The restaurant patrons have also left.  END
BEGIN NOW This was not a good day for business.  END
BEGIN NOW The owner took off running as soon as they didn’t come for him first.  END
BEGIN NOW His english wasn’t the best and he didn’t know how to explain the situation anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW He also knew what cops did to Asians in this town.  END
BEGIN NOW what the cops did to anyone that didn’t speak English so well. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer sees the cops hauling his friends through the front of the restaurant and books it around the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW His mind is a blur of oh shit oh shit oh shit.  END
BEGIN NOW He wants to run all the way to his mom’s house, he also needs to watch the rest of this go down.  END
BEGIN NOW He peeks around the corner and sees Cut kicking and yelling injustice at the cops, three squad cars pull up and Tran goes in the back of one and Cut in the other.  END
BEGIN NOW Two detectives walk into the building and go right for the back door. END
BEGIN NOW I’m fucked.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m so fucked right now.  END
BEGIN NOW they’re going to dust the place for prints or find something with my name on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit shit shit.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m going to jail. END
BEGIN NOW He was barely eighteen.  END
BEGIN NOW he was too young for this.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn’t go to his mom’s house.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s the first place they’re going to look.  END
BEGIN NOW The library was closed.  END
BEGIN NOW he still had the keys.  END
BEGIN NOW He figure that was a good place to lay low.  END
BEGIN NOW At least he could sleep there as long as he left before the opening librarian got there.  END
BEGIN NOW There was another voice in his head.  END
BEGIN NOW The one that told him to go back.  END
BEGIN NOW Goddamnit. END
BEGIN NOW There was a spot where he could see all the cops and their vehicles in front of the restaurant.  END
BEGIN NOW He was pretty sure no one could see him.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided to watch and wait.  END
BEGIN NOW He opened a soda and lit another cigarette.  END
BEGIN NOW An hour went by and he watched as they took all of Tran’s equipment, the computer they worked on.  END
BEGIN NOW The stacks of printouts that they’d stolen over the last year.  END
BEGIN NOW They grabbed everything that looked technical.  END
BEGIN NOW It was all evidence.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer had never been as stressed out as he was right now.  END
BEGIN NOW His friends were in their separate cars were the first to go.  END
BEGIN NOW They were probably taken down town to get filed and placed into hold until someone gave an order to move them wherever they’d have to go.  END
BEGIN NOW From where he was looking, none of them stood a chance.  END
BEGIN NOW Federal property, breaking and entering, petty theft.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t a pretty rap sheet.  END
BEGIN NOW It was enough to send all three of them away for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW At very least they were looking at ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t know anything about law enforcement or how it worked beyond cop shows and what was in the newspapers.  END
BEGIN NOW but that’s most people. END
BEGIN NOW He waited paticiantly and anxiously for them to leave the site.  END
BEGIN NOW A pile of butts at his feet and a few empty, crushed cans sitting next to him.  END
BEGIN NOW The sky was well dark by the time he felt it was safe to go back. END
BEGIN NOW The restaurant was empty, plates of half eaten noodles and dumplings still on some of the tables.  END
BEGIN NOW The phone was ringing.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the lights were back on.  END
BEGIN NOW Sorry about that neighbors, sorry the cops had to pull the plug on your power while they raided the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer was still making an effort to be quiet, thinking someone was going to jump out at him.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like walking into a crime scene.  END
BEGIN NOW He was walking into a crime scene.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit.  END
BEGIN NOW He turned the lights on and looked around.  END
BEGIN NOW The place was gutted.  END
BEGIN NOW clean spots out of place outlined where their set up once was.  END
BEGIN NOW He checked for his backpack and couldn’t find it.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked around for anything, maybe a floppy disk that someone didn’t see.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW They even took the trash.  END
BEGIN NOW a tangle of wires that went up to the roof was dangling in the small window by the ceiling is all that remained of Tran’s phone line handiwork. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer took another look around the room and decided it was a good time to get out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a little money in the bank saved up.  END
BEGIN NOW It was enough for a bus ride.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought it would be best to drain the whole account and go on cash from now on.  END
BEGIN NOW Make his way west.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s where all the money was anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW This town was dead to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d send a postcard to mom, and he hoped his mom wasn’t going to get harassed by the cops.  END
BEGIN NOW It was time to go. END
BEGIN NOW Can’t seem to focus today.  END
BEGIN NOW Every time i start writing something takes me away again.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t seem to find the rhythm.  END
BEGIN NOW Caffeine? nicotine? booze? i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW i have all of those things.  END
BEGIN NOW But my eyes are having a time adjusting, my fingers keep stopping.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m getting too caught up in thinking about the act of writing instead of committing.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it happen organically.  END
BEGIN NOW let it barf right out of the fingertips.  END
BEGIN NOW just like old times.  END
BEGIN NOW except it will never be like the old times.  END
BEGIN NOW the good old days are the good old days because they’re behind us.  END
BEGIN NOW Nostalgia never lies.  END
BEGIN NOW I miss the old apartment, the ballroom.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no other choice.  END
BEGIN NOW We couldn’t afford to do anything else most of the time.  END
BEGIN NOW so we had to write or play music.  END
BEGIN NOW that kind of forced creativity was good for that time of my life.  END
BEGIN NOW Now i’m older and with that comes a shit storm of responsibilities and distractions and other people that i have to think about and worry about and that's life.  END
BEGIN NOW life is all these distractions.  END
BEGIN NOW How many Kubla Khan’s have been ruined by neighbors or friends or parents or spouses. END
BEGIN NOW That’s ok for now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got some Melissa Manchester on the radio.  END
BEGIN NOW a little don’t cry out loud.  END
BEGIN NOW another one of those good old days songs.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though that was what? three years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW it doesn’t even feel like it.  END
BEGIN NOW four maybe? either way, another place, another time.  END
BEGIN NOW another world almost.  END
BEGIN NOW just across the bay.  END
BEGIN NOW snacks are also the devil of distraction END
BEGIN NOW stop eating those chips, loser.  END
BEGIN NOW you have a story to tell. END
BEGIN NOW The bus was pulling into Reno when Sawyer woke up.  END
BEGIN NOW He managed to get a new backpack somewhere along the way, a change of clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW He still didn’t have much, and he was going to keep it that way for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW He was racing the winter weater to the coast.  END
BEGIN NOW He could feel it in the wind right at his heels.  END
BEGIN NOW He whispered his name and it sent a chill down his spine.  END
BEGIN NOW When he slept on the bus his dreams were full of seeing cops charging at him.  END
BEGIN NOW of seeing his friends being tortured in some basement.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreampt of screens wearing badges growing teeth and swallowing him.  END
BEGIN NOW He would wake up in sweats cold and hot the smell of other travelers acosting his senses on all sides.  END
BEGIN NOW The gruff lump of coat and beard he was trying to press himself against the window to avoid seemed to grow wider with every breath. END
BEGIN NOW Ding ding ding 16K fire up the waffles and the luftwaffe and luft balloons and build me up buttercup and let's take this down to dixie and ride like the wind and who cares anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW time for a free write, how you like them apples, you asshole you don’t do you and i don’t care because the radio will sing me to sleep and drown out the snores and the bores and the blah blha blah and what are you going to do about it anyway and here i stand and here i go.  END
BEGIN NOW and oh shit i stopped to adjust and now i’m trying to recover and will he make it folks... END
BEGIN NOW i doubt it.  END
BEGIN NOW i doubt this and i doubt you too.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m johnny fuckin’ appleseed and i’m sowing the seeds of doubt in your cornfields.  END
BEGIN NOW deal with it.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m H H Holmes and i’m going to be up all night in the basement, I’m John Hancock and this is the rubber stamp that i’m going to slap all over your waterlogged watermarks.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m the president of the United States and i’m out of my goddamn mind! I’m johnny carson and heeerrrreeeeesssss johhhhh nyy! I’m jack nicholson and you’re not.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m on a roll down the hill in a barrel over niagara falls and gravity falls and i’m falling down a plot hole and you're’ coming with me.  END
BEGIN NOW you haven’t seen the last of me he screamed shrinking and shreeking and sinking into oblivion and how about that folks? didn’t see that coming the masks under the masks and the masquerade will never stop because you don’t have a fuckin’ clue who i really am.  END
BEGIN NOW there is no journey of self discovery.  END
BEGIN NOW just a chance to give up all over again.  END
BEGIN NOW Just another let down and ground beef and the ground is where i’m going, baby.  END
BEGIN NOW take it or leave it alone and jonestown was the best thing that ever happened.  END
BEGIN NOW Mass is like suicide too.  END
BEGIN NOW except you’re slowly killing yourself and looking into the eyes of the priest while he takes his robes around your neck and puts the squeeze on you.  END
BEGIN NOW and your last breath you gasp and say something stupid like room service and the butler and the maid are busy smoking dope on the veranda.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep crying you little shit.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep punching cracks in the mirror that is the shit facade parade of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW see if they care, if anyone will notice. END
BEGIN NOW I don’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW just leave me alone.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to use your restroom and i’m taking a copy of the new york times bestseller list and i’m going to give myself a dozen paper cuts shoving the whole thing up my asshole so i can shit it out again, put it in it’s place. END
BEGIN NOW There i go, again on my own, stopping for some dumb reason.  END
BEGIN NOW just to change the song.  END
BEGIN NOW keep the fire going.  END
BEGIN NOW keep the flame alive.  END
BEGIN NOW burn the dream to the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW here, here’s some matches.  END
BEGIN NOW here’s a pile of newspaper.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s some highly flammable people.  END
BEGIN NOW shit i stopped again.  END
BEGIN NOW I wish i had someone to slap my in the back of the head everytime i look up or stop typing because that’s the only way we're going to get through this mess together.  END
BEGIN NOW and you’re with me right.  END
BEGIN NOW right along for the ride of your life.  END
BEGIN NOW Its going to be a wild one and it’s going to be a dumb ride and at the end you’re going to be holding a copy of my screenplay and saying, wow, that didn’t go anywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW What a circlejerk.  END
BEGIN NOW you think you’re such a writer.  END
BEGIN NOW you think you can just will a great story into being.  END
BEGIN NOW the great american novel.  END
BEGIN NOW what a joke that all was.  END
BEGIN NOW what a joke all my dreams ever became.  END
BEGIN NOW how many times do i have to start over, never getting stronger, just getting more wounded, more afraid of other people.  END
BEGIN NOW just shaking and hiding alone and trying to avoid attention and not being able to understand why anyone wants that anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t get selfies and i don’t get people that take pictures of their breakfast and i don’t get why we care so much.  END
BEGIN NOW When did we start caring about other people's shoes or the loads and heaps of causal reviews from the common people writing about every single thing that has ever been made.  END
BEGIN NOW I have my doubts that in the culture we’ve created that anyone will ever rise to the kind of greatness that we used to have.  END
BEGIN NOW Nowadays our great people are all CEOs or personal brands.  END
BEGIN NOW Celebrity for the sake of celebrity.  END
BEGIN NOW People that don’t create, people that can’t make anything by themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW And we mock and dismantle every effort by the lower people to try and do anything.  END
BEGIN NOW we strike them down before they have a chance.  END
BEGIN NOW Our culture is a foot holding it’s own head under water. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere in the last ten years, i just turned into this angry person that seems so calm all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW you’re so quiet, you never say anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Why bother.  END
BEGIN NOW I have nothing original to say.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a deflated red balloon.  END
BEGIN NOW like i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW like a person that’s mad all the time and pretends that everything is ok all the time even though he hates everything around him and it makes me sick and people make me sick and i can’t listen to them talk about anything without thinking how stupid they are and how stupid the conversation is and why any of them bother with it and how can they listen to this shit all the time and think it’s anything except a fat load of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW How have we not just put bullets in each others brains by now.  END
BEGIN NOW I have no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I know that i have a hard time participating because what doesn’t make me sick just seems so obvious.  END
BEGIN NOW Like a bunch of mouth breathers talking about how the sky is blue today, it was blue yesterday and the day before that going back as far as ever.  END
BEGIN NOW And they talk about politics and religion and TV shows and books and each other like it’s not the same damn conversation again.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know how you can stand it.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know how any of you can stand it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m Myles Standish and we’re charging into battle.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m Frobisher and this is my sinking ship.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m John Lennon and i’m on broadway playing scenes from the new testament.  END
BEGIN NOW Hold your applause until the gunfire has settled down. END
BEGIN NOW I want to stop on an even number of words END
BEGIN NOW Another day, lets’ give it a short warm up and try to get on with the story.  END
BEGIN NOW The girlfriend and cats are sleeping.  END
BEGIN NOW i’ve drank half a beer and i’m ready i think.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s some blues playing on the radio and maybe that can help me get sawyer off the bus and into the modern era.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m guessing we’ll do the spotty flashback thing to get us back to the present.  END
BEGIN NOW that might work.  END
BEGIN NOW This cold weather is like old times.  END
BEGIN NOW it reminds me of how it was.  END
BEGIN NOW Cold with a few dollars in the back.  END
BEGIN NOW a few warm beers within reach.  END
BEGIN NOW the beer is warmer then i feel and i have blankets to keep me warm.  END
BEGIN NOW ok ok, let’s try to focus on what’s going to happen, He’s on the bus in Reno, something has to happen, some ACTION.  END
BEGIN NOW something EXCITING.  END
BEGIN NOW A THRILL.  END
BEGIN NOW i don’t even know what that means, but maybe we can get somewhere.  END
BEGIN NOW This song started off with the sounds of bottles rattling and a way ward harmonica then the guitar kics in.  END
BEGIN NOW like the good old days.  END
BEGIN NOW That makes me happy.  END
BEGIN NOW try not to let that get in the way of the writing.  END
BEGIN NOW ok let’s go. END
BEGIN NOW The bus pulls into the station.  END
BEGIN NOW The lights of Reno flickering on like a wave spreading over the small strech of downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW Build like a canyon of steel and concrete surrounded by mountains on one side and the flat expanse of dessert on the other.  END
BEGIN NOW little patches of snow visable on the mountains in the distance.  END
BEGIN NOW And California is right over there.  END
BEGIN NOW just over those mountains.  END
BEGIN NOW (oh it’s a jimi hendrix song, neato) And in California there will be oppourtunies.  END
BEGIN NOW There will be money and a chance to start over.  END
BEGIN NOW Take on a new name.  END
BEGIN NOW Forget everything that happened back home.  END
BEGIN NOW He needs that california freshnes, that gold rush calling card siren song to sing him to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW he wants to feel it in his bones and drink it in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW It was amazing, he thought, how in a split second you can make up your mind to do something that never occured to you.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d grown up not giving much thought to where he was or what he was going to do.  END
BEGIN NOW He was absorbed in his hobby.  END
BEGIN NOW His job.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t look too far ahead.  END
BEGIN NOW He was more interested in how the technology grew.  END
BEGIN NOW How the speed of things seemed to double and double again.  END
BEGIN NOW How everything was pushing to go as fast as possible, to break speed limits, space limits, time limits.  END
BEGIN NOW How much smaller the world had become.  END
BEGIN NOW How much smaller the machines had become.  END
BEGIN NOW As a kid he never dreamed he’d be able to have his own computer, much less one small enough to fit in his backpack.  END
BEGIN NOW But that was all possible now.  END
BEGIN NOW He decided he was going to lay low in Reno and work up the money to get a portable computer, then finish the journey west.  END
BEGIN NOW As of right now, he owned his backpack, a light blanket, the clothes and shoes he wore and a change of clothes to wear so as not to stand out too much as a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to get a job.  END
BEGIN NOW And his first stop was the phone booth.  END
BEGIN NOW He opened the phone book and looked up local libraries.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran taught him a little trick with pay phones.  END
BEGIN NOW Something he was forever endebted to him for.  END
BEGIN NOW Back in those days the whole phone system operated on sounds.  END
BEGIN NOW When you put money into the phone, if you listened, you’d hear a series of chirps.  END
BEGIN NOW Turns out if you record that noise and play it into the phone, it can’t tell the difference.  END
BEGIN NOW Tran used to build what he called red boxes.  END
BEGIN NOW He would buy a tone dialer from Radio Shack, a hand held device that would play touch tones in case you still had a rotary.  END
BEGIN NOW With a little bit of wire work, you could program the box to play the sounds of coins being registered by the phone.  END
BEGIN NOW And with that, make all the free calls in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer wished he had one of those now.  END
BEGIN NOW But he could get a pocket tape recorder across the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten minutes later he was on the phone to the local library asking for work.  END
BEGIN NOW Then a few more calls.  END
BEGIN NOW No work right now.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t too discouraged.  END
BEGIN NOW he just got to town.  END
BEGIN NOW He stopped at a gas station.  END
BEGIN NOW a pack of smokes.  END
BEGIN NOW some caffine.  END
BEGIN NOW some fuel.  END
BEGIN NOW He figured he was in Reno, right? the thing to do there was gamble.  END
BEGIN NOW He had just turned eighteen and could get into the casinos.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet he could get a job there.  END
BEGIN NOW And so he went, one gas station shower later, trying to keep himself as clean looking as possible, he went to the strip. END
BEGIN NOW The whole town seemed to glow.  END
BEGIN NOW And that biggest little city in the world sign was a nice touch.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn’t help but be fascinated by the show.  END
BEGIN NOW His town wasn’t much to look at and this was something he’d never even imagined.  END
BEGIN NOW And the sounds were just so constant.  END
BEGIN NOW always a noise and music and people hooting and hollering and calling out to people on the street to come on in and see a show, come on it, a winner every minute.  END
BEGIN NOW Come on down to the buffet.  END
BEGIN NOW all you can eat.  END
BEGIN NOW All you can eat lobster and other luxuries.  END
BEGIN NOW All the creatures of the land and sea, spread out before you.  END
BEGIN NOW fourteen dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW All of it yours. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer figured he’d just keep asking at every place he could until he got a job.  END
BEGIN NOW He met a lot of tough looking types in varying degrees of smart looking suits.  END
BEGIN NOW He shook a lot of hands.  END
BEGIN NOW Saw a lot of show girl legs.  END
BEGIN NOW He was almost at the end of the strip, his feet were sore and he was starting to doubt if anything was going to happen today.  END
BEGIN NOW He walked into a club that wasn’t the nicest place he’d seen that day.  END
BEGIN NOW The paint was a on the old side, the decor was strangely out of place, even for Reno.  END
BEGIN NOW The staff was older, and warmth wasn’t their first impression.  END
BEGIN NOW He did manage to meet with the owner, a short man with light brown skin and black hair that was thinning on top.  END
BEGIN NOW He was sitting behind a desk in the back, The desk was a mess of papers and paper weights and reciepts and casino chips and tokens.  END
BEGIN NOW A plant was dying in the corner next to a poster of an open window with a beach view. END
BEGIN NOW “Look kid, i’m guessing you just got off a bus from bumsfuck Iowa or whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s not my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got plenty of problems and i don’t need yours on the pile, you know what i’m sayin? So you seem like a good kid and i’m up to by balls in shit around here.  END
BEGIN NOW I know what you’re thinking, you’re thinking, hey this guys got it together, the place is great, everything is in order, but let me tell you something, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW You know anything about computers? I need my books in order.  END
BEGIN NOW I can’t make heads or tails or sideways of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a busy man, you know? Lots going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t have time for it.  END
BEGIN NOW And my shithead accountant just booked town, you see.  END
BEGIN NOW That fucking weasel ran out on me.  END
BEGIN NOW Worst accountant i’ve ever had.  END
BEGIN NOW anyway, whatever, fuck him.  END
BEGIN NOW He set up this fucking computer program with all the numbers in it and i haven’t a clue how to work the damn thing.  END
BEGIN NOW If you can get this pile of shit in working order, you got a job.  END
BEGIN NOW Alright? but hear me once, i’m not going to take your shit.  END
BEGIN NOW you give me any shit, anything at all.  END
BEGIN NOW you’re out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW you get one shot.” END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t want to shake hands or exchange names or information or anything.  END
BEGIN NOW So Sawyer sat down and got to work. END
BEGIN NOW It took him two hours to make sense of filing system and it took him another hour to rework it into something sensible.  END
BEGIN NOW The Boss was pleased but didn’t want to appear overly grateful. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright kid, you got yourself a job.  END
BEGIN NOW Keep my books in order and i’ll make it worth your while.  END
BEGIN NOW Here’s your first payment.” he handed Sawyer a hundred dollar bill.  END
BEGIN NOW “Come back tomorrow around three.  END
BEGIN NOW We can work on getting the rest of this mess in order.  END
BEGIN NOW You might be going places, kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Now get outta here, I’ve got work to do.” And with that he had a job and no where to stay but most of the strip was on all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW He just needed a place to nap and a bathroom to use.  END
BEGIN NOW Things were looking up.  END
BEGIN NOW At least as up as they could. END
BEGIN NOW So i’m in this cafe in Japantown and i have a double americano and a few hours of battery life and that should be enough to get something done, but i don’t know how much time i have before distra END
BEGIN NOW see i got halfway through that word and stopped for a good half hour.  END
BEGIN NOW what a chump.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s the problem with cafes.  END
BEGIN NOW too much going on everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW I need an isolation chamber or something.  END
BEGIN NOW The temptation to actually practice all this business i’ve been researching is too much.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve managed to take over the router at this cafe.  END
BEGIN NOW I can change the admin password, the wifi login, etc.  END
BEGIN NOW I was hoping to find a way to put in a backdoor and a sniffer to capture all the traffic from home.  END
BEGIN NOW And the temptation is just to see if i can.  END
BEGIN NOW How much can i really get away with in an hour at a coffee shop.  END
BEGIN NOW Quite a bit it would seem.  END
BEGIN NOW But nothing as scary as some people could manage.  END
BEGIN NOW If i were a better hacker, I’d have this whole shop and everyone in at my fingertips.  END
BEGIN NOW I was tempted to bring my external WiFi unit and set up a fake router.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be doable.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s only a matter of running a few scripts, setting a few options.  END
BEGIN NOW Click, sniff, wait.  END
BEGIN NOW The thing is that most people don’t notice little things like when your connection switches from https to http.  END
BEGIN NOW that little ‘s’ was all that was keeping a third party from seeing everything you send over the wire.  END
BEGIN NOW Your bank information, your facebook, your email.  END
BEGIN NOW I turned everything i’ve got to use two step verification the other week.  END
BEGIN NOW At least no one can get those accounts unless they find a way to spoof and intercept my phone traffic.  END
BEGIN NOW Doing that requires some heavy radio equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW Having a hard time focusing on this, which is shitty.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t get a damn thing done on this page yesterday.  END
BEGIN NOW A whole 1666 behind.  END
BEGIN NOW All i had to do was open this thing and stare at it long enough for me to do something to it.  END
BEGIN NOW I have time between running nmap.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do both.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe… END
BEGIN NOW OK regrouping… where are we in this story.  END
BEGIN NOW our hero(??) is in Reno, he got a job for now and a shady ass boss.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s all fine and dandy.  END
BEGIN NOW We should maybe check in on Mr. President and the eastern europeans.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that’s the only other types i’ve written.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m getting close to the halfway point and need to get there by sunday.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s 6k words in two days.  END
BEGIN NOW Super doable.  END
BEGIN NOW I can do that all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even a little problem.  END
BEGIN NOW just need to psych myself up a little bit.  END
BEGIN NOW All the people have left the cafe anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Great.  END
BEGIN NOW gogogogo. END
BEGIN NOW One of the dining rooms in the White House is especially for luncheons.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of these were conducted with various leaders of industry, heads of states, Mr. President’s personal advisors. END
BEGIN NOW There was a lot of talks that happened in this little nook.  END
BEGIN NOW The room was flooded with light from a bay windows.  END
BEGIN NOW Attached to the underside of the table, some of the chairs, a few of the paintings were radio transmitting bugs from the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, old KGB, new KGB, MI6, MI5, Mr. President’s personal bugs, and a few randoms stuck there from various independant guests of the White House over the years. END
BEGIN NOW The room was like a diner booth near a community college except all the gum under the table was listening.  END
BEGIN NOW There were two other men at the table aside from Mr. President.  END
BEGIN NOW They were drinking screwdrivers made with pre-soviet vodka and fresh squeezed orange juice flown in from Spain. END
BEGIN NOW “A lovely lunch as always, Mr. President.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re chef has never been better.” One of the gentleman at the table says, pulling a black box from his coat pocket.  END
BEGIN NOW “Forgive my assumptions, but I think this might be necessary to jam this room.” He pushes a red button and a high frequency tone screams out over the perceptible range of the people in the room.  END
BEGIN NOW All the bugs are hit with a deafening squeal.  END
BEGIN NOW In vans parked all over the Washington DC area dozens of agents rip off their headphones in a fit of pain and swearing. END
BEGIN NOW “I think we should have some level of privacy now.  END
BEGIN NOW You said this was a matter of national security and we agree.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve been keeping an eye on Romania for the last few years, or really since ‘46.  END
BEGIN NOW The Ukraine has been a little more difficult to keep a hold in.  END
BEGIN NOW Unrest and all that.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve managed to get a handfull of sleepers in as of late.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t look good.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s some very wealthy people that want to break us.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re offering bounties on agent lists and any databases they can get from the outside.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t afford another Snowden or God forbid, another Wikileaks.” The man that did most of the talking wasn’t from one of the three letter acronym agencies.  END
BEGIN NOW His organization was older and more clandestine.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t have a name.  END
BEGIN NOW They had their fingers in all the pies and strings for all the puppets.  END
BEGIN NOW I wouldn’t say they had total control, but i would say they had influence and information.  END
BEGIN NOW They also didn’t have to answer to anyone under Mr. President himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Even then, they considered this a low level meeting.  END
BEGIN NOW Presidents come and go.  END
BEGIN NOW They had been firmly in their position since they splintered off from the OSS before the CIA was formed.  END
BEGIN NOW Their training was rigid and spanned a wide variety of diciplines.  END
BEGIN NOW They were the top of the tops, often faking the deaths of agents from other organizations and resurecting them with a new name and a new life.  END
BEGIN NOW C’est le espionage. END
BEGIN NOW “Can we sabotage from the inside? I want to say bomb the fuckers, i really do.  END
BEGIN NOW But everyone is telling me we can’t just bomb them without getting everyone declaring war.  END
BEGIN NOW What about a drone strike? We could disguise a drone as coming from Russia, the media will believe that.  END
BEGIN NOW Russia would love to bomb the Ukraine again.” Mr. President is eager to push the big red button.  END
BEGIN NOW he’s starting to get an erection just thinking about it. END
BEGIN NOW “Afraid we’re going to have to keep this as cold as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t even borrow a seal team.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be best if we didn’t have to send anyone in at all.  END
BEGIN NOW Our counter espionage units are fairly close now.  END
BEGIN NOW And we have a few sleepers, like i said before.  END
BEGIN NOW This is going to be a bit more complicated than just walking in, firing up and EMP and hoping we knock out enough to set them back.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about all that would happen, just a delay.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t know where the money is coming from.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s going to be the key to stopping this.” END
BEGIN NOW “A quick and dirty money cut.  END
BEGIN NOW Just freeze the assets? I guess that’s ok.  END
BEGIN NOW I want you guys to get me a name.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to know every person on every bounty.  END
BEGIN NOW We probably don’t have a lot of time.  END
BEGIN NOW I want this before the week is up Gentlemen.” Mr. President started to get up from the table and the two men with him got up also. END
BEGIN NOW They did the buttons on their jackets and shook hands.  END
BEGIN NOW The man pressed the red button on the little black box and the high pitched frequency stopped.  END
BEGIN NOW A flurry of people in vans all over DC put their headphones back on and eagerly waited to hear something important. END
BEGIN NOW “And tell your chef that the quiche was just divine.  END
BEGIN NOW I should like to hire her for a weekend at Camp David.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we should have a retreat when this whole mess is behind us.” They clap each other on the back and laugh about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, they’ll have a weekend retreat and their kids will go swimming and their wives will gossip.  END
BEGIN NOW And the men will drink brandy and smoke cigars and talk about their mistresses and foreign affairs and investments.  END
BEGIN NOW It will be a lovely weekend, hardly a care in the world. END
BEGIN NOW In an abandoned hotel in a small Romanian town there’s a group of ten young men huddled around screens propped up on old wooden tables from the soviet era.  END
BEGIN NOW The electricity has been rigged from the city's power grid, they guy that did the wiring worked for the city, he wasn’t that expensive to get the job done.  END
BEGIN NOW The internet connection was much the same story.  END
BEGIN NOW These government workers were a lot cheaper these days.  END
BEGIN NOW Greasing palms would get you a blind eye and as good a wiring job as you could get. END
BEGIN NOW The crowd is all young men, most of them self educated.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanks to getting internet access, a lot of them dropped out of school and learned on their own.  END
BEGIN NOW And because it was so easy, many of them took to running scams as a part time, and very lucrative job.  END
BEGIN NOW Fraud is a lot easier when you don’t have to show your face.  END
BEGIN NOW Even easier still when everything you need to know to run the scam is already a few searches away.  END
BEGIN NOW It takes about twenty minutes on average to get to know someone online.  END
BEGIN NOW You can find address, phone number, friends, relatives, job history, education.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of that information has been cataloged by companies that needed to.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest we provided.  END
BEGIN NOW Signing up for accounts that have public displays.  END
BEGIN NOW It all gets cataloged.  END
BEGIN NOW and it’s all so easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW Different scams required different approaches and types of information.  END
BEGIN NOW The easiest and most common was to exploit sexual appetites and loneliness.  END
BEGIN NOW The scammers would pose as women who often had recently lost a loved one.  END
BEGIN NOW They would provide pictures copied from revenge porn sites, where ex-boyfriends post pictures and video of some girl that broke up with them.  END
BEGIN NOW Take that, some sad backstory, and you’d have men all over the world sending you money for plane tickets, for funeral expenses, for buying a new watch, a new car, whatever you wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW It was too easy.  END
BEGIN NOW They would sit in internet cafes and chat up other men across the globe, squeezing out a few dollars here and there and occasionally a large sum.  END
BEGIN NOW When they wanted to know what became of their little investment, something would always come up.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of these men would be strung along for years.  END
BEGIN NOW Others, it was just a grab and go.  END
BEGIN NOW They would be too embarrassed to report anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them had wives.  END
BEGIN NOW It wouldn’t look good that they lost a few thousand dollars to support some poor girl in Syria.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, you could make it look like charity, but that was always a stretch. END
BEGIN NOW That was always how it started with this crowd.  END
BEGIN NOW Then they would learn more advanced forms of phishing.  END
BEGIN NOW Phishing takes the ‘ph’ in its name from the old phone phreaks.  END
BEGIN NOW The basic idea behind phishing is that you coerce people into giving up information by making yourself look like a credible source.  END
BEGIN NOW They had tools to clone a website, making you think you were logging into your bank or your email.  END
BEGIN NOW They had a dummy server set up that will log your credentials, then send you off to the real site saying that the password was incorrect, please try again.  END
BEGIN NOW in the mean time, they had a database full of usernames and passwords for your bank account.  END
BEGIN NOW The system was very simple. END
BEGIN NOW Collect as many email address as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Clone an email from the bank so that all the text and graphics look exactly like the real thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Tell the customer that they found something on their account requires their immediate attention, have them click a link from the email to the dummy server, they log in, it doesn’t work, they log in again, and everything appears normal.  END
BEGIN NOW Little do they know, they’ve given everything away.  END
BEGIN NOW And over in Romainia and the Ukraine, and Nigeria, someone is harvesting that information, reselling it, or siphoning money from it to a private account somewhere else. END
BEGIN NOW They developed what they call spear phishing, which is where you target an individual, or small group of individuals.  END
BEGIN NOW Say you wanted to get access to a company’s server.  END
BEGIN NOW You go over to LinkedIn, find the company and harvest all the email addresses attached to that company.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re running linux, you can download a script that will do this for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Next, forge an email from the system administrator saying that something is going down, or some system needs to be reconfigured and everyone needs to go reset their passwords.  END
BEGIN NOW You clone the company pages, figure out what software they use for all this, easily done with a few searches or spidering the company website, and set up a duplicate site that is on your own server.  END
BEGIN NOW Most people won’t know the difference and just click away because it’s their job.  END
BEGIN NOW Because they're used to it.  END
BEGIN NOW and it’s just another hassle from the IT department. END
BEGIN NOW After that, you have access.  END
BEGIN NOW From their it’s a matter of escalating privilege.  END
BEGIN NOW This is accomplished by either exploiting a bug in the software that will break and transfer you over to an administrative account, or most of the time, that information is already there, you just need to find it.  END
BEGIN NOW Once found, most of these credentials are encrypted and the average person thinks, great, case closed.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the case by a long shot.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re no good at picking a password, it’ll take between one and fifteen minutes to crack the code.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re smarter, it could take a few days.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re really clever, if will take much too long and the attacker will likely give up.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes an encrypted password can take years.  END
BEGIN NOW The way it works is like this, you have a password, let's say it’s ‘vanilla’ when you enter that password into a computer it runs it through a very complicated bit of math called an algorithm.  END
BEGIN NOW This takes ‘vanilla’ and turns it into ‘e8228fbca27926470a009c04a6af6df5’.  END
BEGIN NOW (that’s an MD5 hash, if you want to know the algorithm.) The math is such that simply reversing it is impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW So what the clever code breakers figured out was that we can take a list of words, run it through the same algorithm until we get a match.  END
BEGIN NOW With a modern computer this can take little more than seconds for a word like ‘vanilla’.  END
BEGIN NOW However, if your password was ‘I like vanilla ice cream’ it will take much longer.  END
BEGIN NOW The reason being that phrases are not listed in a word file.  END
BEGIN NOW And having a list of phrases would take much longer to figure out and be an extravagantly large file.  END
BEGIN NOW Throw in some symbols and numbers to make, ‘I l1kE v@n1lla Ic3 Cream’ and you have a password that will take years to decrypt.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again, that depends on how fast your computer can translate the words into hashes. END
BEGIN NOW In Romania one of the kids looks up from the group and says, END
BEGIN NOW “I got it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got the hash file.” He smiles a very proud smile.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the other kids goes to a cooler and gets a round of beers for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW From this point most of the process will be automated.  END
BEGIN NOW They’ll split the hash file into workable pieces, and each person will let it run until all the passwords have been recovered.  END
BEGIN NOW That was all their employer wanted from this job.  END
BEGIN NOW These kids knew that this information was more valuable than that.  END
BEGIN NOW They would keep it and resell it as many times as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW There were many enemies of this company.  END
BEGIN NOW The fact that they had some rather large military contracts with the United States made it that much more desireable.  END
BEGIN NOW For now, in Romania, they would drink, and they would wait.  END
BEGIN NOW In the US, on a military contract server in the midwest, no one is awake to notice a few files being transferred.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is there when a backdoor is installed to look like a normal service.  END
BEGIN NOW They will show up for work tomorrow and no one will notice a damn thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Because they have security measures in place and they trust them.  END
BEGIN NOW How can their be a fire if the alarm never goes off? END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer peeks through his curtain at the street below his apartment.  END
BEGIN NOW The van is still there.  END
BEGIN NOW It hasn’t moved.  END
BEGIN NOW The damnest thing was how clean it was.  END
BEGIN NOW There were trees all up and down the street.  END
BEGIN NOW There was bird shit on every other car parked along it.  END
BEGIN NOW But not the van.  END
BEGIN NOW The van remained untouched by nature.  END
BEGIN NOW Pristine and black and haunting.  END
BEGIN NOW It sent a chill down Sawyer’s spine as he drank his coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW He rememebered seeing simular vans a few other times.  END
BEGIN NOW But mostly he remembered the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW He remembered the look on his friends faces as they were tossed in the back of the cop cars.  END
BEGIN NOW He remembered that feeling of fear and helplessness.  END
BEGIN NOW He had never been so scared in his life.  END
BEGIN NOW He closed the blinds.  END
BEGIN NOW He had to go to work that day and every part of him didn’t want to leave the house.  END
BEGIN NOW He backed up everything he might want or need on his computer.  END
BEGIN NOW He did a low level format all all his hard drives.  END
BEGIN NOW Guess it’s time to start fresh again.  END
BEGIN NOW He began thinking about if it was time to move again.  END
BEGIN NOW If he was ready for it.  END
BEGIN NOW He had enough money saved up, that wouldn’t be the problem.  END
BEGIN NOW But he had made the mistake of settling down to much.  END
BEGIN NOW He had too much stuff here.  END
BEGIN NOW In his mind that meant he had more than he could pack up and haul on a bus in twenty minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW His beauitful machine that he’d been building over the last few years.  END
BEGIN NOW The last few quiet years he’d spent writing code, doing a little light breaking and entering.  END
BEGIN NOW Not hurting nobody.  END
BEGIN NOW just for fun.  END
BEGIN NOW He let his guard down.  END
BEGIN NOW He got ready for work thinking about all these things.  END
BEGIN NOW About how he’d become soft and careless.  END
BEGIN NOW He could easily end up in the back of a cop car too.  END
BEGIN NOW He always did his best to cover his tracks but there’s always a little bit of digital residue left over.  END
BEGIN NOW Somethings you can’t erase with out being in the same room.  END
BEGIN NOW He was getting nervous.  END
BEGIN NOW He packed his laptop in with his work uniform, a few other things he couldn’t live without, a change of clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW Took a look at his apartment, and hoped he’d be able to come back to everything being in one piece.  END
BEGIN NOW He locked the door and made his way to the elevator. END
BEGIN NOW In the lobby of his build there were two cops.  END
BEGIN NOW They were talking to the building manager.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer ducked behind a wall and ran through the list of alternative exits to the building.  END
BEGIN NOW He checked his watch.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to not attract any attention, he walked slowly to the stairs and went up a floor.  END
BEGIN NOW He made his way across to the other side of the building and down to a side door that spit out on the opposite street.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked around before getting all the way out.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t want to act suspicious.  END
BEGIN NOW But he was doing it anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Being cautious can be seen as suspicious to some people.  END
BEGIN NOW He kept telling himself to act casual.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just a guy that’s going to work, he told himself. END
BEGIN NOW The few blocks he had to walk to the train station were wraught with looking over his shoulder, trying not to bump into things.  END
BEGIN NOW It was slow going.  END
BEGIN NOW By the time he made it to the restaurant he was ten minutes late.  END
BEGIN NOW All bad, he kept thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW This is all bad.  END
BEGIN NOW His boss.  END
BEGIN NOW A kind lady in her early forties stopped him. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re late Tim.” She wasn’t smiling.  END
BEGIN NOW She usually smiled when she talked to him. END
BEGIN NOW “I, i’m sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW won’t happen again.” He didn’t want to look in her eyes, he never really liked to look people in the eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Look, this isn’t like you and the last few days haven’t been like you.  END
BEGIN NOW Is there something going on? Do you need someone to talk to?” She wasn’t smiling, but there was still a kind of kindness and concern in her face. END
BEGIN NOW “Just overslept a bit.  END
BEGIN NOW really, that’s all.” He was stuttering and fidgeting.  END
BEGIN NOW He was used to showing up to work, doing his job and going home.  END
BEGIN NOW No one bothered him and he didn’t bother anyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW Except that one dishwasher. END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, as long as that’s all.  END
BEGIN NOW Suit up, we’re going to have a busy night.” END
BEGIN NOW She wasn’t kidding about the busy night.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a convention in town for something or other.  END
BEGIN NOW The crowd looked very techie.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of name badges and guys in smart casual dress code khaki pants with long sleeve button up shirts with the sleeves rolled up the elbow.  END
BEGIN NOW They all had black leather padded briefcases.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them had beards to varying degrees.  END
BEGIN NOW They bought a lot of food and even more drinks.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them didn’t really understand that when the kitchen is closed that means there’s no one back there to cook for you anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW That the bar is closed so it’s time to take your party somewhere else.  END
BEGIN NOW He was making some of the last rounds, picking up glassware stashed behind the plants by the host stand, finding fallen forks underneath the booths.  END
BEGIN NOW He brought a tub of dirty dishes and food scraps and soiled linens back to the dishwasher and went through the motions of scraping the food off, separating everything into like piles.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought he was about done.  END
BEGIN NOW He went up to the bar to see if they needed anything.  END
BEGIN NOW There was still one guy sitting down, taking his sweet time with his last drink.  END
BEGIN NOW The bartender was just about done cleaning up. END
BEGIN NOW “Do you need anything? The dining room is pretty much done.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks Tim, I’ve got it from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Just one more thing to take care of,” She eyed the man sitting down.  END
BEGIN NOW “Actually, you want to go drop off his tab? That’d be a real help, thanks.” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer walked over to the table and put the folded reciept down near the man's glass. END
BEGIN NOW “Whenever you’re ready, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “Heh, Tim? Is that what you call yourself now?” END
BEGIN NOW “Excuse me?” Sawyer looked down at the man for the first time.  END
BEGIN NOW His hair was tied back in a long pony tail.  END
BEGIN NOW His face was rough, but clean shaven. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s been a while, Sawyer.” Cut looked up from his glass of scotch to get a good look at his old accomplice’s face.  END
BEGIN NOW “Been a damn long while.” END
BEGIN NOW I wrote some words on social media about the tragedies that took place over the last few days i did my best to keep it succinct and respectful.  END
BEGIN NOW We live and die by soundbites these days and today I’ve been mulling over the shootings and the bombings and when i got home i thought, i need to get good and drunk and angry and let it all out.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly because i can’t afford a therapist.  END
BEGIN NOW But i can’ afford to write it down.  END
BEGIN NOW That is, after all, one of the points of this month’s exercise. END
BEGIN NOW The funny thing about social media, is that it’s like giving everyone you know or want to follow a bull horn.  END
BEGIN NOW Then you walk into this room and all these people are shouting at you.  END
BEGIN NOW This endless stream of opinions and thoughts and advertisements.  END
BEGIN NOW And we see it all the time and we become numb and dumb to it.  END
BEGIN NOW We have people we consider friends that go through hard times and good times and we just scroll by.  END
BEGIN NOW Pressing like, or favorite.  END
BEGIN NOW thinking we’ve done our part.  END
BEGIN NOW Believing that our clicks make a difference.  END
BEGIN NOW Dollars and sometimes even votes make a difference.  END
BEGIN NOW but at the end we’re all defeated. END
BEGIN NOW Our likes don’t make a difference.  END
BEGIN NOW Our reposting and sharing don’t do any good.  END
BEGIN NOW Spreading awareness, you might think.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting the word out.  END
BEGIN NOW Let the people know what’s going.  END
BEGIN NOW And then what? Does anyone remember the occupy movement? What did that ever do? We got a lot of people very mad.  END
BEGIN NOW And that anger is good.  END
BEGIN NOW hold on to that.  END
BEGIN NOW Let it be your guide.  END
BEGIN NOW But the reality is still the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing changed.  END
BEGIN NOW If anything the 1% is more powerful now than ever before.  END
BEGIN NOW And they know it.  END
BEGIN NOW The 99% showed that the most they could do was gather in the street and yell a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe throw some molotovs around.  END
BEGIN NOW Most likely, end up in jail.  END
BEGIN NOW Protest never accomplishes anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Our collective anger only ends up with more political prisoners.  END
BEGIN NOW And even still those prisoners are just another one of you or me.  END
BEGIN NOW Homeless, unemployed, Either way.  END
BEGIN NOW The media will spin it however they will.  END
BEGIN NOW No one is going to show up to the polling booths anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW The guns end up in the hands of those paid to do a job.  END
BEGIN NOW The may have morals, or ideas.  END
BEGIN NOW They might be damn good people at the heart of it.  END
BEGIN NOW But they didn’t have anything else going on, so they took a job.  END
BEGIN NOW And they still have rent and wife and a kid or a husband and bills to pay.  END
BEGIN NOW So they put on swat gear and stand in a row and shoot tear gas and hate what’s happening too.  END
BEGIN NOW What can they do? What can anyone do after the fact.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll wager that the aftermath of all this is going to mean less freedom, more police, and more surveillance.  END
BEGIN NOW Justification for aggressive political action.  END
BEGIN NOW The same kind of action that provoked all of this in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW People keep forgetting that we made the terrorists.  END
BEGIN NOW Go back and check out 1946.  END
BEGIN NOW Go see what the civilized world did after the second world war.  END
BEGIN NOW Go look at how we, in our infinite wisdom thought it would be ok for us to toy with the boarders, to send occupation troops into foreign lands.  END
BEGIN NOW set up camp all over the world like we owned it.  END
BEGIN NOW We made this.  END
BEGIN NOW We built the terrorists.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just in the middle east, but also in south america, in africa.  END
BEGIN NOW The Whole continent of Africa.  END
BEGIN NOW Not just one country.  END
BEGIN NOW The western world, in it’s utter arrogance, thought they were doing something good.  END
BEGIN NOW At very least something good for business.  END
BEGIN NOW And business was good.  END
BEGIN NOW The war machines have made out like bandits to the tune of billions of dollars.  END
BEGIN NOW Many billions of those have been payed for by taxpayers.  END
BEGIN NOW By votes.  END
BEGIN NOW Democracy and capitalism might actually work, but just like communism, they are subject to human greed and idiocy.  END
BEGIN NOW All political systems are wrought with failure because people are involved.  END
BEGIN NOW Going back to the story i’m trying to write, people are always the weakest link.  END
BEGIN NOW often we go back to the story of the ants.  END
BEGIN NOW The metaphor we love as the underdog.  END
BEGIN NOW how the many oppressed outnumber the few in power.  END
BEGIN NOW and all we need to do is rise up and take action.  END
BEGIN NOW That happened in France.  END
BEGIN NOW it was a bloodbath.  END
BEGIN NOW It happened, kind of, in America.  END
BEGIN NOW It was also a blood bath.  END
BEGIN NOW We have several thousand years of human history on record, most of it is violence and bloodshed.  END
BEGIN NOW and What have we learned? We’ve learned how to make bigger explosives and more powerful guns.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s about it.  END
BEGIN NOW We have the majority of our resources, financial, political, scientifically, minerally, all devoted to the war machine.  END
BEGIN NOW And while i understand that it’s gotten so out of hand that we have a justifiable amount dedicated to defense, the vast majority is poised, waiting to strike, on the offensive. END
BEGIN NOW It just makes me so angry.  END
BEGIN NOW It always has. END
BEGIN NOW I remember back in high school, i was listening to college radio a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a broadcast that was an interview with someone that took a tour of a sweatshop down in mexico.  END
BEGIN NOW I was livid.  END
BEGIN NOW How could we do this to ourselves.  END
BEGIN NOW What happened to people.  END
BEGIN NOW I was raised in this christian idealist world where the golden rule was a real thing, where treating other people with kindness and respect and being humble and taking only what you needed was more than just a bumper sticker.  END
BEGIN NOW And listening to this made me so mad because our teachers never said a word of this, every adult i’ve ever known never said that this was the reality of the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW That our infrastructure failed because we made sweatshops and sold the work to third world kids that made pennies to make our shoes.  END
BEGIN NOW Working in slave conditions because that was what you did for work. END
BEGIN NOW We’re an incredibly adaptive species.  END
BEGIN NOW We can survive in extremely brutal conditions.  END
BEGIN NOW We can live and die in the worst ways possible.  END
BEGIN NOW We can put up with all manner of terrible things.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how we survived.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s gross about it is that we’ve taken advantage of it.  END
BEGIN NOW We abolished slavery and put up sweatshops.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost in the same breath. END
BEGIN NOW Macbeth’s soliloquy was one of the most profound things i ever learned in my youth.  END
BEGIN NOW it sums up social media, the news, and most everything i’ve ever heard since.  END
BEGIN NOW Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I feel the same way about my writing.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't’ believe it will accomplish anything.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t have any grandiose ideas about saying anything profound.  END
BEGIN NOW I know i’m just one white man versus the world.  END
BEGIN NOW And in this day and age that means less to my merit than ever before.  END
BEGIN NOW Just be being a white man i’ve already lost credibility.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve already wasted my words on deaf ears.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re the privileged majority, you have no right to have a say in anything.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t know about oppression.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t know about racism.  END
BEGIN NOW you don’t know about discrimination.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t know and you can’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW Because you’re white and you’re a man.  END
BEGIN NOW And Because of the circumstances of your birth, your opinion is invalid.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t mean to play the pity me, i’m the poor white man card.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just saying, if you’re going to cry racist and sexist, don’t be a racist and sexist right back at me. END
BEGIN NOW I’m just really overwhelmed by the amount of shit that’s happened in the news lately.  END
BEGIN NOW The overwhelming amount of death.  END
BEGIN NOW The sheer volume of body count.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s enough to make us all numb to the numbers.  END
BEGIN NOW the math doesn’t lie and it hurts.  END
BEGIN NOW and in between it all we expected to just carry on with our lives.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t been provoked to tears since the 9/11 attacks.  END
BEGIN NOW provoked to tears in the sense that i cried because of people i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW that the sheer amount of tragedy overwhelmed me.  END
BEGIN NOW i can’t write anymore tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW That sucked the life out of me for last day or so.  END
BEGIN NOW And i’m behind now.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck it.  END
BEGIN NOW no time to dwell in the past.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s recap and try and get back in it. END
BEGIN NOW So we cut and sawyer reunited, we have the higher ups planning a cold op in eastern europe.  END
BEGIN NOW romania is moments away from starting a massive chain reaction.  END
BEGIN NOW i don’t think i have anything else going on.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s considerably less than how i usually tackle this project.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess past and present MC is almost like a dual character.  END
BEGIN NOW We can do a little flash back before we get back into our little reunion.  END
BEGIN NOW That seems like the best course of action.  END
BEGIN NOW WHEN WE LAST LEFT OUR HERO, HE WAS ROMPING AROUND RENO… END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer awoke as was his custom in those days in the early afternoon.  END
BEGIN NOW The desert sun baking his long term hotel room, turning any amount of air flow and open windows into a convection oven.  END
BEGIN NOW He never managed to get a proper bed, sleeping on an old mattress without any covers on floor.  END
BEGIN NOW He had his winter clothes in a pile, his summer clothes in another pile.  END
BEGIN NOW The laptop he managed to save up for by the head of the mattress.  END
BEGIN NOW His back pack with cables and wires and a handful of small tools.  END
BEGIN NOW A few handy things he managed to build from scraps of radio equipment.  END
BEGIN NOW He had been in Reno for a little over two years.  END
BEGIN NOW And he was starting to get an itch to move on.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a good amount of cash saved up.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough to get a bus ticket west, enough to have a place to stay and something to eat when he got there.  END
BEGIN NOW To supplement his accountant gig, he started taking jobs at various restaurants and casinos, mostly busing tables.  END
BEGIN NOW There wasn’t a whole lot else for him to do in this down.  END
BEGIN NOW Not when he was trying to keep a low profile.  END
BEGIN NOW He did manage to forge some decent looking identities.  END
BEGIN NOW Just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a little obsessed with making sure he had a back up plan.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t going to get caught like last time.  END
BEGIN NOW He swore he was going to be prepared for the worst. END
BEGIN NOW Ever since the attacks last september, he was even more careful.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw how the police were being transformed into a state militia.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw how the suspiciousness of the general populace was on the rise.  END
BEGIN NOW How standing out in any way would be grounds for people to make phone calls to anonymous tip lines.  END
BEGIN NOW His goal was to blend in.  END
BEGIN NOW Not do anything to attract attention to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW And so he worked, kept his head down, and prepared for shit to the fan, either a war breaking out at home, or his past catching up to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He had the luxury of not being attached to anyone in town.  END
BEGIN NOW He had somehow escaped the traps and temptations of the opposite sex, confining himself to his roach hotel room, his jobs.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting paid cash whenever possible.  END
BEGIN NOW Forging a plausible enough identity to cash a check if need be.  END
BEGIN NOW Being as untraceable as he could.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t too hard in this town.  END
BEGIN NOW Most people didn’t want to know anything about you.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like a crumby version of Vegas, with money coming in from the ski slopes over the mountains in Tahoe.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the locals were stuck there with thoughts that would one day leave town.  END
BEGIN NOW Head over to California.  END
BEGIN NOW Live that endless summer life.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them never made it, placing the wrong bets, gambling their winnings back to the house.  END
BEGIN NOW Classic mistakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer didn’t gamble.  END
BEGIN NOW He was curious about card counting and breaking blackjack.  END
BEGIN NOW But the risks outweighed the reward.  END
BEGIN NOW For fun, he took his accounting work around town and that got him access to most of the computer and banking systems.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t even have to do anything.  END
BEGIN NOW They just told him how to get in so he could balance the books.  END
BEGIN NOW It bored him.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed the thrill of the hunt.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed digging through dumpsters, trying to find printouts.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed the way Cut would call up an office and talk his way into gaining remote access.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed watching Tran rig the phone lines so they could trick caller ID systems into thinking they were calling from anywhere they wanted.  END
BEGIN NOW This made it even easier to trick people into giving up valuable information.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed the late nights they’d spend chain smoking over cans of cola, laughing about their conquests. END
BEGIN NOW The game had changed a lot over the last few years.  END
BEGIN NOW More and more dial-ups were disappearing.  END
BEGIN NOW The networks were all moving to the internet.  END
BEGIN NOW everything was getting more connected.  END
BEGIN NOW All the old phone numbers were being replaced by internet protocol addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW The tools were changing with the territory.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer was running a custom linux build.  END
BEGIN NOW He rewrote much of the software, which was also easier now, thanks to the open source movement.  END
BEGIN NOW There were a host of new languages to learn as well.  END
BEGIN NOW He taught himself PERL and HTML rather quickly.  END
BEGIN NOW The migration over to internet also meant that targets were more varied.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t limited to anything in his area code anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW He could dial up one of the service providers and from there poke around networks on the east coast, or the midwest or the south.  END
BEGIN NOW or Europe.  END
BEGIN NOW or Russia.  END
BEGIN NOW Funny thing about computers, no matter what language you speak, you have to write code in english.  END
BEGIN NOW This made Sawyer’s hobby that much easier for him.  END
BEGIN NOW He could read website’s code like you or I could read a flyer on a phone poll.  END
BEGIN NOW He could look at program code and figure out what was going on before running it.  END
BEGIN NOW He found some other hobbyists and would help them debug their code and submitted some things of his own.  END
BEGIN NOW All anonymously of course.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a little easier in those days to stay hidden behind a screen name.  END
BEGIN NOW Especially if you were jumping around between different free providers.  END
BEGIN NOW Or using hijacked accounts.  END
BEGIN NOW The security was pretty lax in those days.  END
BEGIN NOW A lot of people were new to this.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t even think about the idea of someone trying to break in.  END
BEGIN NOW They were more concerned with trying to make it work in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW The software was breaking, seemingly on its own, more often than not.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer had a bad habit of breaking into a network, finding some broken software and fixing it.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he would leave a note for the admin.  END
BEGIN NOW More often he wouldn’t, getting a kick out of some guy logging in to find his code working all of a sudden.  END
BEGIN NOW Blaming it on computer magic.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew there was probably some good money in his skills.  END
BEGIN NOW He also knew he had a record and was still at large.  END
BEGIN NOW Forever a fugative.  END
BEGIN NOW He was going to have to keep his real name out of everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The digital equivilent of playing dead. END
BEGIN NOW He managed to crawl off the matress in the mid afternoon heat and get a glass of water from the sink.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked around the room and decided it was time to pack it up.  END
BEGIN NOW He turned off his laptop and packed the power cord.  END
BEGIN NOW he fit what clothes he could, making sure to account for the trip over the mountains, which was sure to have some cold points.  END
BEGIN NOW He rounded up the rest of his stuff in trash bags and hauled them down to the Goodwill.  END
BEGIN NOW He walked down to the bus station and bought a ticket.  END
BEGIN NOW And without looking back, he got on the bus and headed west. END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to start following the oldest piece of writing advice i ever got, which is to keep making things worse for the characters.  END
BEGIN NOW So with that in mind…. END
BEGIN NOW The bus made it to the top of the mountain before one of the tires blew.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t one of those cute puncture holes where the air slowly leaks out, making a slow motion comical whoopie cousin like sound.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a bang.  END
BEGIN NOW A boom.  END
BEGIN NOW and the bus lost it’s balance like a still drunk man trying to tip toe out of a party in the early morning avoiding landing his feet on the still sleeping deziens of late last nights festivities.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus driver tried to hit the brakes and pull the wheel.  END
BEGIN NOW The bus lurched and tilted, trying to compensate for having it’s front foot kicked out from under it.  END
BEGIN NOW Teetering on the narrow mountain road, the passengers, still fresh in the horror of international bombings and airplanes flying into buildings, heard only the banging and booming and the shockwaves and the motion sickness.  END
BEGIN NOW They went into hysyterics almost immediatly.  END
BEGIN NOW The screaming didn’t help the driver any.  END
BEGIN NOW He tried to put his expirience on this road to good use.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d driven this road in storms of all kinds, through every season and weather pattern that could hit.  END
BEGIN NOW And this just wasn’t his day.  END
BEGIN NOW Into the mountain, he thought.  END
BEGIN NOW If you have to crash this thing, go into the mountain.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t go over the edge.  END
BEGIN NOW Just get the bus to stop.  END
BEGIN NOW The three remaining tires caught a patch of ice and suddenly stopped taking direction from the steering wheel.  END
BEGIN NOW Onward and forward slid the bus, a victim of momentum.  END
BEGIN NOW If it weren’t for the fact that they were on a downward slope, everything might have gone differently.  END
BEGIN NOW Into the guardrail the bus crashed, bending and pulling out the wooden poles, twisting the thin steel aroudn the form of the bus. END
BEGIN NOW Everything seemed to stop except the people screaming, convinced they were going to die, offering nothing in a time of crisis except a loud caucouphanus bluster.  END
BEGIN NOW Metal creaked and adjusted, the bus leaning over the edge of the mountain, swaying in the wind.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer found himself lucky to be in the back of the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW He was mister low profile and the back of the bus is always where you sit in that situation.  END
BEGIN NOW The only attention you get there is from the drunks and crusty street kids and the left overs of Jerry Garcia’s children.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer usually had headphones and his trusty walkman.  END
BEGIN NOW He had ripped the headphones off and regretted subjecting himself to the sounds of panic coming from the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW Some army vet type was trying to calm down the mothers and their kids and the panic stricken others.  END
BEGIN NOW He reassured them that they weren’t dead yet and if everyone kept calm they might all get out of this alive.  END
BEGIN NOW He tried to tell them that they had to Kick the emergency exit window out of the back and slowly work their way out without tipping or rocking the bus back.  END
BEGIN NOW He was very loud and made people listen to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t go through the shit storm of serving in war overseas to die in a bus crash in the mountains above reno.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t going to die like this.  END
BEGIN NOW He yelled and told the people at the back to kick the shit out of that window and pull the release handles and start crawling out the back.  END
BEGIN NOW He told the rest of the people in the bus to work their way, slowly towards the back. END
BEGIN NOW The people were still in a panic.  END
BEGIN NOW They were clawing and rushing to the back as fast as they could, pushing each other out of the way before the bus took a nosedive to the crags below.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer and the bum next to him had managed to get half the window loose and were working on the other half when the crowd pushed up against them.  END
BEGIN NOW The window popped open.  END
BEGIN NOW The crowd having nowhere to put their momentum fell towards the front of the bus.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer and the bum fell out the back with the window and hit the ground shoulders first and saw the bus full of screaming people tilt over the guardrail and with a motion that was more like giving up, plumet what looked like a hundred feet down, rolling against the side of the mountain, glass shattering in the screams, the metal frame of the bus crushing and twisting like an oversized beer can against the forehead of a mountainous man.  END
BEGIN NOW The bum rolled over coughing.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer slumped over in the snowy dirt of the summer, breathing heavy, eyes wide. END
BEGIN NOW The bum recovered enough to evaluate the situation. END
BEGIN NOW “Wheelll hot shit and damnation! ain’t we the lucky son’sabitches.” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer wasn’t ready to talk yet, but i think he gave the bum a look.  END
BEGIN NOW He was still breathing pretty hard.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t sure about what was behind his look, he was right there with the bum, they were the lucky ones.  END
BEGIN NOW At the same time, they very nearly were not at all.  END
BEGIN NOW At the same time a good forty or so people just fell to their deaths in piss smelling state run bus.  END
BEGIN NOW At the same time some of them were probably still alive.  END
BEGIN NOW He was pretty sure he could hear some of their screams, floating up the side of the mountain. END
BEGIN NOW “Holy hot fuck in hell.  END
BEGIN NOW What a ga’damn rush.” The bum was almost dancing around in circles, shaking his hands and his head and utterly the odd, “wooo!” and “Ohboy!” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer had managed to twist his body into a sitting position and gain control of his breathing.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked at the scene of the dancing bum and the edge of the cliff were a bunch of people just died, or were in the process of dying, or maybe were lucky enough or not to survive the fall. END
BEGIN NOW “we should do something…” he managed to say weakly, maybe at the bum, maybe to himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe to god.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t sure. END
BEGIN NOW “Do something? Do something?! you’re damn right we oughta do somethin’! we oughta get the shit off this damn mountain is what!” END
BEGIN NOW “no man.  END
BEGIN NOW i mean, like.  END
BEGIN NOW about those people over there.” END
BEGIN NOW “Who them? they dead or good as dead.  END
BEGIN NOW You a doctor? you a nurse?! a trained medical professional?! you don’t look like one.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t look like one at all.  END
BEGIN NOW You just look like me.  END
BEGIN NOW A waste’a’ga’damn space.” The bum’s dance was slowly spiraling down.  END
BEGIN NOW “Damn thin mountain air.  END
BEGIN NOW Can’t much make a motion in this stuff.” The bum took a look around.  END
BEGIN NOW They were sitting in the middle of the road and there was a huge chunk of guardrail taken out on one side. END
BEGIN NOW “There could be survivors! shouldn’t we do something?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nah.  END
BEGIN NOW Fuck ‘’em.  END
BEGIN NOW You want to risk your lucky ass to save those screaming shitheads? i didn’t think so.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s get down from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Never thought i’d want to get back to the heat.  END
BEGIN NOW But shit it’s cold up here and when that sun goes down it’s only gonna get colder.  END
BEGIN NOW you hear me? let’s move.” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer pulled himself off the asphalt and found his land legs again.  END
BEGIN NOW His backpack was down in that bus.  END
BEGIN NOW He was kicking himself for not throwing it out in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW He his clothes and his wallet and that was it.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t dressed for a night in the mountains.  END
BEGIN NOW It was best to get moving.  END
BEGIN NOW stay warm.  END
BEGIN NOW The bum was following the road and Sawyer was following the bum. END
BEGIN NOW “Shouldn’t we wait for a rescue team?” Sawyer managed to say. END
BEGIN NOW “OH yeah, we should.  END
BEGIN NOW when do you think they’ll show up? Today? Tonight? Next week? fuck’em.  END
BEGIN NOW We can make it town before we die tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW We stand more of a chance trying to hitch a ride out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW Ain’t much but the daily bus and a few logging trucks that take this road.  END
BEGIN NOW Could be days before anyone finds those sorry shits.” END
BEGIN NOW The flurry of emotions that hit sawyer over the last hour were being over ridden by two prevailing feelings.  END
BEGIN NOW He was scared of dying up from freezing to death, and he was really annoyed.  END
BEGIN NOW That this was happening at all.  END
BEGIN NOW That he was stuck with this bum.  END
BEGIN NOW That he forgot his backpack.  END
BEGIN NOW In the face of a near death expirience, he found himself, mostly irritated. END
BEGIN NOW Not bad right? a little action.  END
BEGIN NOW A little spicy up.  END
BEGIN NOW a little something to chew on maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got another 13 days of dishing out shit to everyone in this story.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i’ll introduce a character just to shit all over them.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i will.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i’ll see where this idea of starting off each writing session with just make it worse.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever is happening in the story, make it worse for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW I have to say, i was half tempted to kill Sawyer in his own flashback.  END
BEGIN NOW just be like, oh shit, sorry folks, alternate timeline.  END
BEGIN NOW Then just keep killing the little bastard.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not too late.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s a good plot device.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe someday people will enjoy a post modern novel like that.  END
BEGIN NOW i’ve read a few people where everything and nothing happened.  END
BEGIN NOW you have a hard time keeping track of who’s dead and who’s alive and who is a who and not someone’s armchair.  END
BEGIN NOW It can get a little hairy.  END
BEGIN NOW So i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m taking this beast into new territory.  END
BEGIN NOW quite honestly, i may have been getting bored with the original idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m still hip to playing out scenes from the new cold war in a way.  END
BEGIN NOW But i’m not committed to anything right now.  END
BEGIN NOW Just cranking out garbage.  END
BEGIN NOW I am commited to that.  END
BEGIN NOW If there’s one thing i know i can do.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s be a shit factory.  END
BEGIN NOW Alright, sixteen more words, and then I’m out of here.  END
BEGIN NOW Gotta hit six six six six. END
BEGIN NOW The house is quiet aside from the cats and me.  END
BEGIN NOW So i‘m going to take advantage of the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW I went out and had 3 beers and one tequila.  END
BEGIN NOW which is putting me right in the feel good spot.  END
BEGIN NOW The two tacos might have helped.  END
BEGIN NOW but i’m all blanket wrapped and able to type.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s the important part.  END
BEGIN NOW ready to tackle this bastard bit of writing.  END
BEGIN NOW The hardest part is being able to let go of my own narrative.  END
BEGIN NOW Killing the narrator, as was aptly put in your own work.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to separate the me from my writing and make it it’s own thing.  END
BEGIN NOW There needs to be some separation.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not writing a damn auto biography for christ’s sake.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what i’m writing.  END
BEGIN NOW Just whatever seems interesting to me at the time.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that’s a good enough point.  END
BEGIN NOW treat it like an extended exercise.  END
BEGIN NOW Remember what i’m trying to accomplish which at the baseline is just the act of writing at least 2000 words a day.  END
BEGIN NOW If i can get back in that habit, i can do a lot more then write what amounts to a teenage fantasy novel with a bunch of jargon thrown in for kicks.  END
BEGIN NOW The hardest part is snapping that narrator neck.  END
BEGIN NOW Letting it go and letting the fingers do the walking.  END
BEGIN NOW Trying to hold back the urge to dip into my linux environment and see if there’s any more stuff like last night, when i found some audit server on the subnetwork for a local school system where i grew up.  END
BEGIN NOW Where no one bothered to change anything from the defaults.  END
BEGIN NOW I managed to log in with the old ‘admin’ username ‘admin’ password.  END
BEGIN NOW From there found the open file transfer protocol, downloaded the encrypted password file, decrypted it in about five minutes, logged in as the root account and found nothing of interest.  END
BEGIN NOW Couldn’t upload to the web facing directory since they were smart enough to make it read only.  END
BEGIN NOW But dumb enough to make it easy to use the highest level account.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t get it.  END
BEGIN NOW If i had the skills, that server would have been mine to control.  END
BEGIN NOW It would have been easy too.  END
BEGIN NOW This story is bleeding a bit too much into my own brain and I’m in danger of believing it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d better get back in it and start making things worse.  END
BEGIN NOW When in doubt, make everything worse.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s always more entertaining to watch a character struggle. END
BEGIN NOW There were no streetlights in the mountains.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s what bothered Sawyer the most.  END
BEGIN NOW He couldn’t see too far ahead in the dark.  END
BEGIN NOW Just enough to see the bum.  END
BEGIN NOW It was too cold for either of them to talk much.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly silent.  END
BEGIN NOW Almost completely dark.  END
BEGIN NOW There was enough moon glow to know where your feet were falling.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough feel left despite the cold to know you were walking on asphalt.  END
BEGIN NOW They were both plugging along, arms close to the body, eyes looking both in front of the feet and to the horizon.  END
BEGIN NOW trying to find a sign of lights.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking for shelter.  END
BEGIN NOW It was slow going.  END
BEGIN NOW The road would start to dip, making them think they were finally on their way down only to dip back up a few meters later.  END
BEGIN NOW They would pause every hour or so and share cigarettes, rarely talking, both of them knowing the cold was only going to grow with the dark.  END
BEGIN NOW As evening turned into night and the sun was long gone and neither of them could tell how far they’d gone, or how far they had to go.  END
BEGIN NOW The hot desert air from Reno seemed ages away.  END
BEGIN NOW The unknown mountain town they plugged toward seemed impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW What on earth had they gotten into. END
BEGIN NOW “Hooooboy, my balls are frozen solid as rocks.” END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s just keep moving, plea-eese.” he shivered. END
BEGIN NOW ‘Eh you see that!” the bum sounded excited. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer looked up and saw some light off in the distance.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe another mile or two down the road. END
BEGIN NOW “Just a bit longer and we’ll be up to our nuts in hot soup and a warm bed.  END
BEGIN NOW Told you as much.” END
BEGIN NOW Just up the road they found the moonlit sign that said ‘Hinton 0.5 miles’ and that was all they needed.  END
BEGIN NOW They scrambled as much as their legs could the rest of the way. END
BEGIN NOW What they found on a arrival was bunch of trailer parks and a half built church.  END
BEGIN NOW The half church would have to do for the night.  END
BEGIN NOW It was enough shelter in the construction equipment and mostly built walls to keep the wind off their bodies while they tried to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a long night. END
BEGIN NOW When the sun and trucks pulling up pulled them out of a light sleep they both knew it was best to keep moving.  END
BEGIN NOW The bum wasn’t much to try and get help from the locals here.  END
BEGIN NOW There were mountain folk and didn’t take kindly to a couple of bums wanting a free meal.  END
BEGIN NOW The only information they got was that Truckee was another few miles down the road.  END
BEGIN NOW It would take them until late afternoon to get there.  END
BEGIN NOW When they did, they found a diner and hot food and it was the closest thing to heaven.  END
BEGIN NOW They gorged themselves on hot stew and sandwiches and fresh coffee.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer picked up the tab discreetly, not wanting his traveling companion to know about his cash on hand.  END
BEGIN NOW He was grateful they got this far, but wasn’t about to trust him.  END
BEGIN NOW he was already stranded.  END
BEGIN NOW he didn’t need to be broke and stranded.  END
BEGIN NOW The bum took to mostly drinking his coffee and staring out the window.  END
BEGIN NOW He was surprisingly quiet since they got to town. END
BEGIN NOW “There’s a bus that’s gonna be passing through soon enough.  END
BEGIN NOW We should get back to it.” END
BEGIN NOW “You can go on ahead.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got some things to take care of here.” END
BEGIN NOW “whatever,” Sawyer said, stating the slogan of his generation. END
BEGIN NOW He greedily finished his soup and coffee, left some money on the table and thought it best to get while he could. END
BEGIN NOW He left the bum at the table, looking out the window and a thousand miles past it.  END
BEGIN NOW He was eager to get this whole thing behind him.  END
BEGIN NOW Plan A.  END
BEGIN NOW If you can stick it, keep on with plan A.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer walked out of the diner and down he street and bought warm coat. END
BEGIN NOW The bus station was just like all the rest of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Just a bit smaller.  END
BEGIN NOW There was only two places to go from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Sacremento or back to Reno.  END
BEGIN NOW On to Sac he went.  END
BEGIN NOW Bus was due in the next two hours.  END
BEGIN NOW He stopped into the bar down the street to wait it out and have a few cheap beers in the meantime.  END
BEGIN NOW The tv was playing news of the bus crash he was in.  END
BEGIN NOW A couple dozen people dead.  END
BEGIN NOW No survivors mentioned.  END
BEGIN NOW He was mostly glad that they left.  END
BEGIN NOW It wouldn’t have made a difference.  END
BEGIN NOW He drank three bottles of cheap beer before he left to go wait at the bus stop. END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure what to do now.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess we should go back to present day.  END
BEGIN NOW Need to focus.  END
BEGIN NOW having a hard time trying to think of plausible ways for things to go wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s always the past catching up with you problem.  END
BEGIN NOW but that’s kinda the present story line.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s going to happen now that Cut has been reintroduced.  END
BEGIN NOW is he going to try and recruit sawyer into some scheme.  END
BEGIN NOW is he going to be bitter and resentful or suspicious about how Sawyer walked from the whole thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Is he going to want revenge or is he going to try and save him from his mundane life of busboy by day.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s going to happen in Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW Will they succeed.  END
BEGIN NOW Will the great US nation infiltrate and cause a ruckus.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know.I over slept and i’m still sleepy.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe ate too much, Hemmingway always advised against writing with a full belly.  END
BEGIN NOW I should listen to my mentors. END
BEGIN NOW In a forest town in Romania they are clinking beers and toasting each other to another job well job.  END
BEGIN NOW The money would be wired over soon enough and they would all be feasting and partying in the club with whores a plenty.  END
BEGIN NOW They were having a good laugh over a joke someone told a minute ago about farm animals and country folk when the boss walked in. END
BEGIN NOW “Glad to see everyone enjoying themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope we can keep this going, we just have one more thing to take care of.” END
BEGIN NOW He walked around the group of guys with their beers.  END
BEGIN NOW And their smiles all start to fade into looks of concern.  END
BEGIN NOW He loops around once and he’s the only one with a smile now.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s not really a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s the look someone has when they know something that no one else in the room knows.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a look that says something very bad is about to happen. END
BEGIN NOW He grabs one of the guys by the hair as he circles around and drags him while he screams.  END
BEGIN NOW He drags him a few feet away from the rest of the group and let's go so that his head hits the floor. END
BEGIN NOW “It would seem that we have a traitor in our midst.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope we don’t have to repeat tonights performance again.” He puts on a pair of black gloves and his assistant hands him a ball peen hammer. END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sorry to the rest of you that we only found out about this too late.” He takes the hammer and comes down hard on the guys kneecap.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a dull crack followed by a high pitched scream. END
BEGIN NOW “We usually can sniff these types out before it becomes a problem, but this one must have some nice connections.” END
BEGIN NOW He takes the hammer and swings down on his other knee cap.  END
BEGIN NOW Another scream and his pants are starting to turn red.  END
BEGIN NOW His hands go towards the wound, there’s nothing he can do to stop or help the pain he’s in.  END
BEGIN NOW His screams have turned into sobs moans of anguish. END
BEGIN NOW The man with the hammer turns to the group of guys still holding their beers and looking more scared than ever.  END
BEGIN NOW They remember the witch hunts during the occupations over the years.  END
BEGIN NOW it was never pretty. END
BEGIN NOW He takes the hammer and cracks it hard on the guys shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW right near the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW if he’s not going to kill him, he’s going to leave him pretty useless.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks to the other side and comes down again with the hammer in other shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW The man on the floor is a gasping pile of flesh, squirming on the ground, unable to comprehend his situation. END
BEGIN NOW “our friend here,” the man with the hammer pauses slap the man on the ground in the temple with his weapon.  END
BEGIN NOW “Our friend here, seems to think that he can get away with helping out our enemies in russia.  END
BEGIN NOW He thinks he might still get paid on both sides.  END
BEGIN NOW He is a fool!” and he brings the hammer down on the other side of the man’s head, leaving him to wriggle in his own blood, unable to walk, his arms dead at the shoulders, his mind subject to sheer blinding pain.  END
BEGIN NOW “Take this trash out.” The man with the hammer says, and two men appear from the doorway and drag the bleeding victim from the room.  END
BEGIN NOW He will be pulled down to the basement and thrown, barely alive into the incinerator used to heat the building.  END
BEGIN NOW It will smell like burning man flesh for weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW An olefactory reminder to the remainder of the men about loyalty. END
BEGIN NOW About 25 clicks away a group of three special forces men are walking towards the town on the maps in the briefing room.  END
BEGIN NOW They have their plan and they have about twenty four hours to execute. END
BEGIN NOW They’re cold and the three of them alone have to take down what they’ve been told is a terrorist organization of unknown number.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re equipped with some of the most expensive tech the military could afford to send them off with.  END
BEGIN NOW They have the firepower to level a small town if need be.  END
BEGIN NOW They also have the clearance.  END
BEGIN NOW Just in case.  END
BEGIN NOW The world will turn a blind eye and it won’t make national news, which is important.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s enough political unrest in the area and has been for years.  END
BEGIN NOW They had to start from airdrop and make the rest of the way on foot.  END
BEGIN NOW The plan was to arrive at dusk, likely when the targets were all in place.  END
BEGIN NOW Assess the building, infiltrate, and neutralize.  END
BEGIN NOW Their team of three was to sweep from the bottom to the top, clean it up, and leave no trace of US involvement.  END
BEGIN NOW Operations like this were taking place all over the world all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Only the mistakes made the news.  END
BEGIN NOW This couldn’t afford to be a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW For every mistake the amount of enemies would grow.  END
BEGIN NOW With every mistake it made it harder for the higher ups to get those budget cuts they needed for the bigger operations.  END
BEGIN NOW Three men made a small price to pay if all would be lost.  END
BEGIN NOW It also allowed for less mistakes.  END
BEGIN NOW Once they were dropped they were told that all knowledge of their actions would be disavowed by the military and governments on all sides.  END
BEGIN NOW They were a ghost squad. END
BEGIN NOW By dusk they had spotted the building shown to them during the briefing.  END
BEGIN NOW An old run down hotel.  END
BEGIN NOW Activity on the fifth floor and the 11th.  END
BEGIN NOW Guards at all doors.  END
BEGIN NOW They stopped to go over the plan.  END
BEGIN NOW The plotted a course to the top of the building, to cut all the wires going into and out.  END
BEGIN NOW Jam all the wireless and take everything down.  END
BEGIN NOW If they are successful, they can call in an airlift.  END
BEGIN NOW if not, they’ll be left for dead.  END
BEGIN NOW They carry no identification and wear no flags.  END
BEGIN NOW They are the elite of the elite and they have no backup, no family, and will never be acknowledged for their service. END
BEGIN NOW Honestly, i’m bored writing this weak rainbow six shit.  END
BEGIN NOW big fucking deal.  END
BEGIN NOW small task force versus some post cold war still cold war third world nerds.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s not really what i would think of as exciting.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s not great writing.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe it’s all just a metaphor.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s all very symbolic.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s all just a load of garbage.  END
BEGIN NOW whatever, the biggest problem is that when i don’t care i can’t type enough.  END
BEGIN NOW i pause too much.  END
BEGIN NOW or when i’m writing something i don’t know about then i have to stop and look things up.  END
BEGIN NOW boring.  END
BEGIN NOW bored, and stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW write a bar scene.  END
BEGIN NOW write about boys and girls and how terrible complicate that whole thing is.  END
BEGIN NOW write about modern love or modern family or the conflicts of past ideals vs present day reality.  END
BEGIN NOW write about the emptiness inside the writer and how his antisocial tendencies seem to exacerbate his dilemma.  END
BEGIN NOW write about conflict and tragedy and society.  END
BEGIN NOW write about people and how infinitely complex and utterly simple they can be.  END
BEGIN NOW write about the dichotomy of balance.  END
BEGIN NOW write about the subtleness of the state of being in between.  END
BEGIN NOW write about the drunkard and five years sober ex drunkard.  END
BEGIN NOW write about the gambler and the liers and the cheats.  END
BEGIN NOW the whores and husbands that love them.  END
BEGIN NOW write about children and their wisdom next to their insufferable behaviour.  END
BEGIN NOW write about writing.  END
BEGIN NOW but for god's sake.  END
BEGIN NOW don't’ write a bunch of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW i don’t know if i can anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Bukowski wrote about his life and the horror that he was trying to be a man with his demons on his sleeve and the idiots that he surrounded himself with.  END
BEGIN NOW Kerouac wrote about the undying fire of youthful idealism confronting the reality of life with age and the dangers of substance abuse.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson wrote about sports and politics through the veil of the freak with too much time on his hands and access to drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Woodward and Bernstein wrote about Tricky Dick and the hotel of horrors and did it all with trenchcoat deep throat sources and cloak and dagger reporting style that made them famous.  END
BEGIN NOW Robbins wrote like he sat at the kids table while Leary and Bob Wilson were high on acid carving a turkey made out of stars.  END
BEGIN NOW Hemminway wrote like he was writing for the new york times and sick of everyone around him and had to drink all the time to be ok with it.  END
BEGIN NOW Stienbeck wasn’t much different, just stuck in California.  END
BEGIN NOW And what am I writing? A lenghty commentary about modern social politics with global politics thrown in because i spend every morning wondering why i woke up so i can read the headlines instead of living in my dreams. END
BEGIN NOW It’s a sick sad world is one thing i’ve learned.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a piss stained shit pants of a life.  END
BEGIN NOW That wouldn’t make a very good holiday feel good movie of the year.  END
BEGIN NOW But it would be interesting.  END
BEGIN NOW Christmas is canceled, go get a job.  END
BEGIN NOW Go get a job so you can pay eighty percent of your income towards rent.  END
BEGIN NOW Go get a job so you can pay taxes on wars that everyone denies that we’re fighting.  END
BEGIN NOW or that we’ve been fighting them for so long that everyone has forgotton that there’s a war going on.  END
BEGIN NOW Because it’s not at home.  END
BEGIN NOW Something i read the other day when someone was complaining that Paris was getting all the attention after their tragedy and the half dozen other tragic things that happened that week weren’t getting the spotlight, the comment was, “You don’t report a fire in a furnace.” Which got me thinking.  END
BEGIN NOW There have been so many headlines i’ve scrolled past about bombings, and shootings, and other horrible things.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, some guy in Florida raped and killed ten people.  END
BEGIN NOW well that’s Florida for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh, a bomb went off in iraq.  END
BEGIN NOW When doesn’t a bomb go off in iraq.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh the third world is having a rigged election after the last rigged election.  END
BEGIN NOW The people are in the streets with banners and guns and marching.  END
BEGIN NOW Big deal.  END
BEGIN NOW But no one runs around Paris every day shooting up the town.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s news.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s new.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s not what we’re used to.  END
BEGIN NOW So before people start going off about all the unreported terrible things going on in the world, maybe they should actually read all the reports.  END
BEGIN NOW Because they’re there.  END
BEGIN NOW They still report all the bombs in Iraq, all the violence in Egypt, all the dumb shit that police get caught doing.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just that there’s so much of it that we’ve become numb and as a general rule, don’t collectively care.  END
BEGIN NOW we can’t care about everything, that would be a lifetime of giving to charity, of cleaning up other people’s messes.  END
BEGIN NOW that would be an unending storm of crap.  END
BEGIN NOW and no one can deal with that.  END
BEGIN NOW We still need bus drivers and mailmen.  END
BEGIN NOW We still need school teachers and plumbers and fry cooks.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t all stop what we’re doing for an unending moment of silence.  END
BEGIN NOW If the goal of terrorism is to disrupt the opulent lifestyle of the western world, then the best defence we have to is keep living it.  END
BEGIN NOW throw your fingers in the air and order a cheeseburger.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for it.  END
BEGIN NOW Laugh, love, go to the movies.  END
BEGIN NOW We live in such a fucked up world that even if you’re lucky enough to get past christian guilt, there’s heaps of other kinds of guilt people are trying to throw on you all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t all help everyone, get real.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t all have the power or the resources to end world hunger or clothe the homeless or heal the sick.  END
BEGIN NOW Because all the power rests in the hands of the higher ups.  END
BEGIN NOW They could do it.  END
BEGIN NOW They could stop everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Stop making and selling guns, stop the war machine, stop throwing food away.  END
BEGIN NOW But you and me, Joe and Jill Average, we got nothing, because we’re giving all to the gas pump and the landlords and the taxman. END
BEGIN NOW I’m having a bit of a hard time grasping where i left off.  END
BEGIN NOW The kid is in Truckee, heading to the coast, the Romanians had a violent shake up, The americans are moving in for the kill.  END
BEGIN NOW In present tense, They’re still at the restaurant, seeing each other’s faces after some ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW The silent Tran is still elusive.  END
BEGIN NOW We could write him out like he never made it past the system, or got deported.  END
BEGIN NOW Or maybe he got out on good behaviour and started a company.  END
BEGIN NOW Who knows.  END
BEGIN NOW I should get back to the present and flesh out something that’s happening between the nerds.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t have a cliffhanger like that for too long before people forget what’s happening. END
BEGIN NOW He was just sitting there with his long hair still there but pulled back.  END
BEGIN NOW He was drinking scotch instead of cola now.  END
BEGIN NOW He was wearing a suit instead of ripped jeans and punk rock shirts.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a briefcase. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s….  END
BEGIN NOW Good to see you, Sawyer.” He said, before taking a short sip of his drink, he set it down neatly, being sure to center it on the napkin. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s been a long time, Cut.” Said Sawyer, standing but not sure what to do with himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of him wanted to make an excuse and get out of there.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of him wanted to hug his old friend.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of him wanted to get his tab taken care of and get off work before dealing with what was clearly a personal problem. END
BEGIN NOW “Please, call me Carter, That’s what they put on my business cards.  END
BEGIN NOW Besides, those days are… behind me…” He looked around the room in a suspicious sort of way.  END
BEGIN NOW The way bank robbers case a room every time they enter.  END
BEGIN NOW Taking a note about all the cameras, security personnel, every exit in and out of the place. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, listen, i don’t mean to be a prick, let me finish up and we can go catch up somewhere else.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh yeah, right, this is your job.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t mean to make a scene.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, I’ll wait for your outside.” He pulls out his wallet and pays his tab.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaves a fairly standard tip, takes his coat and walks out the front door. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer wipes the table off, takes the tab to the bartender, clocks out, and changes his clothes.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks out the front door with his backpack, still carrying his laptop, his getaway supplies.  END
BEGIN NOW He figures, what the hell, he didn’t want to go back home tonight anyway, might as well catch up with his dear old friend. END
BEGIN NOW “What are you doing with yourself, man? I haven’t seen you in ten years and you’re out here bussing tables.  END
BEGIN NOW Shit, man.  END
BEGIN NOW I thought you would be running a software company by now, or getting a stock pay out or something, shit.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re worth so much more than this…” he waves at the restaurant, “this..” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know, man.  END
BEGIN NOW every since… the last time i saw you, i’ve been keeping things kinda low key.” END
BEGIN NOW “Kinda low key and doing everything short of leaving the country and faking your death, that’s a pretty broad spectrum.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s taken me a long time to track you down.” Carter formerly known as Cut takes an expensive cigarette from his coat pocket and lights it, then offers one to Sawyer.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer says no thanks, and pulls out his own pack.  END
BEGIN NOW They find a bench and sit down, smoking. END
BEGIN NOW “You know, for a while, I wasn’t sure if you had anything to do with Tran and I getting busted.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed a little too convenient.  END
BEGIN NOW You getting off free while the two of us got hauled off like a couple of terrorists.  END
BEGIN NOW I was angry and confused for a long damn time.  END
BEGIN NOW Once I got out and started to reestablish myself, I figured out there was no way you were involved.  END
BEGIN NOW You ran.  END
BEGIN NOW You couldn’t have made a deal with anyone if you went running.  END
BEGIN NOW That means you were scared.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten years on the run.  END
BEGIN NOW That must have been some fun times.” He flicks some ash and takes a long drag. END
BEGIN NOW “I lost track of Tran when i was in the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW From what i know, he was deported back to ‘Nam.  END
BEGIN NOW He told me he was born here, either that was a lie, or they didn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know what happened after that, except a guy like that is dangerous if he’s got a grudge.  END
BEGIN NOW The way he could wire a phone line is nothing compared to what he could do with explosives with a little know how and the right people with him.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sure there’s plenty of people over in S.E.A.  END
BEGIN NOW that want to take a swing at the old U S of A.  END
BEGIN NOW We haven’t been the nicest to South East Asia over the years…” Carter looks over at Sawyer, who’s been staring at the ground and smoking two cigarettes for the one that Carter was working on slow. END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus,” was all he could say.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, sure his life hadn’t been peaches and cream since that whole thing went down.  END
BEGIN NOW But he didn’t get sent back to his home country, he didn’t spend hard time.  END
BEGIN NOW He just ran from town to town, changing his name, working odd jobs. END
BEGIN NOW “Hell, After that stunt you pulled in Reno, I thought you were dead.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t till you landed in Stockton and your work was just getting so easy to recognize.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like you had a signature.  END
BEGIN NOW The whole security community could see it.” Carter put his cigarette out and looked at his old companion. END
BEGIN NOW “So, like, what happened to you, man?” Sawyer felt like an idiot saying it, but it was something that was on his mind for the last ten years.  END
BEGIN NOW It would seem that he had left some traces of himself.  END
BEGIN NOW Traces only someone like Cut would have been able to find. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh you know, same old story.  END
BEGIN NOW Spent a few years in the joint.  END
BEGIN NOW Made some friends, you know how I can talk to people.  END
BEGIN NOW Eventually, I got out on good behaviour and a favor.  END
BEGIN NOW Feds needed a guy to help with one of the malware outbreaks back in 2005.  END
BEGIN NOW They tapped me and I wanted to get out.  END
BEGIN NOW Honestly, i spent a lot of their resources trying to track you down.  END
BEGIN NOW It took me awhile before i realised that you had nothing to do with me being in jail and nothing to do with the malware outbreaks.  END
BEGIN NOW That shit was all coming out of China and Russia.  END
BEGIN NOW still is.  END
BEGIN NOW But it took me some time to work that out and it ended up getting me a job.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m a consultant now.  END
BEGIN NOW funny, right?” END
BEGIN NOW They both are looking at the stars or looking at the ground.  END
BEGIN NOW Funny how life is.  END
BEGIN NOW One guy ends up in jail, spends a few years in a waking nightmare, but cops a deal, and ends up with a career.  END
BEGIN NOW His buddy spends his young adult life on the run, ends up bussing tables.  END
BEGIN NOW What a crazy world. END
BEGIN NOW But what about the van? What happened with the van?! END
BEGIN NOW Back at Sawyer’s apartment, the power goes out.  END
BEGIN NOW The floor above and the floor below go down with it.  END
BEGIN NOW The phone lines go down too.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a man with a cell phone jammer the size of a mini fridge strapped to his back.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s holding firm in the lobby while a team of six men in full swat gear march up the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW They Hold positions on both sides of the door, one man in each stairwell, one by the elevator.  END
BEGIN NOW They give each other hand signals and on three they kick down the door. END
BEGIN NOW They’re saying things like “GO GO GO.” and “GET DOWN” and “FREEZE YOU PIECE OF SHIT” END
BEGIN NOW They turn on their flashlights and see a mother and father with their young child huddled into a corner, scared, wide eyed.  END
BEGIN NOW The cops find the family computer and haul it out of the room, they cuff dad, they cuff mom, they take the kid to child services.  END
BEGIN NOW This is just temporary until they have time to check over the computer and find evidence.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer’s neighbors are as innocent as anyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a few illegally downloaded MP3s.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe a few movies.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing major.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly they would used the computer to do their taxes and buy things.  END
BEGIN NOW Make some video calls to their moms and dads.  END
BEGIN NOW They were by all accounts, normal and boring.  END
BEGIN NOW it would be a few weeks before they were back at home and things were restored.  END
BEGIN NOW It would be a few weeks of being stuck in holding, interrogation, pleading their innocence.  END
BEGIN NOW No one thought it was just the quiet guy next door.  END
BEGIN NOW It wasn’t until digital forensics went through their router logs and noticed repeated late night connections from a MAC address that didn’t belong to anyone in the house.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s when they figured out that their WiFi was hacked. END
BEGIN NOW Here’s the funny thing about MAC addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW Every device has one, and each one is unique.  END
BEGIN NOW they have a format that looks like: 20:E5:2A:5E:12:37 the first half will delineate the manufacturer, the second half will identify the make and model.  END
BEGIN NOW The problem is that changing this for most devices is a process that takes at most, a few minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW you can make it so that your router identifies as an iPhone, or your iPhone identifies as smart TV.  END
BEGIN NOW Or you can make up a number as long as it follows the xx:xx:xx:yy:yy:yy format.  END
BEGIN NOW The number set is in hexadecimal you have values ranging from 0-F where F=15.  END
BEGIN NOW This gives us 281,474,976,710,656 possible combinations.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re at a point in history where we’re running out of available addresses, so they’re extended the format.  END
BEGIN NOW The main point of his rabbit trail is two fold.  END
BEGIN NOW A search and a little bit of know how means any device can masquerade as any other device.  END
BEGIN NOW The other thing to keep in mind is there are security measures that require connected devices to have certain MAC addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW The problem is, those addresses are broadcasted to the public.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s say, for instance, you’re running a private network at your place of business.  END
BEGIN NOW You’ve setup your WiFi to filter out approved MAC addresses, thinking that anyone with an unregistered device won’t be able to get in.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m an attacker, using only my cell phone, I can sweep the radio signal and every device will bounce back with information including the device name, MAC address, IP, and possibly more.  END
BEGIN NOW I then use a bit of software to change my MAC address to one that’s already connected to your network.  END
BEGIN NOW The router sees the same address, says right this way sir, and I’m in.  END
BEGIN NOW If i need the password to the WiFi as well, that will take at most another thirty minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW If i have a laptop, maybe less.  END
BEGIN NOW If i’m a social engineer, it will take a phone call.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m enjoying these tangents of explaining security things.  END
BEGIN NOW It helps me remember how much i know and gets me to research what I don’t.  END
BEGIN NOW they can also be very distracting.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes i’ll start looking up something and hours later i’ll be running subnet scans and trying to find vulnerabilities.  END
BEGIN NOW the thrill of the hunt is slow and methodical.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s an interesting time we live in, when we have hackers that are actively working against, working with, and working for the governments of the world.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s hackers that made a legitimate business out of it.  END
BEGIN NOW And many more that made a less than legitimate business.  END
BEGIN NOW In addition to all the old tricks, we now have ransomware, which is truly sinister.  END
BEGIN NOW One wrong click and all of your data, your entire computer is encrypted with someone else's key.  END
BEGIN NOW And the only way to get it back, if you don’t have backups, is to pay up.  END
BEGIN NOW We have ways to put invisible frames into web pages, luring victims to click on things they can’t even see, in turn giving the attacker tokens that allow them to masquerade as the victim.  END
BEGIN NOW It goes so much deeper than just passwords and usernames.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking back at the TalkTalk breach from last month, when a couple of kids managed to leak the user database of a large telecom company.  END
BEGIN NOW And they did it by executing a single command.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, that’s all it takes.  END
BEGIN NOW One single vulnerability.  END
BEGIN NOW One kid with a keyboard that read a tutorial.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose i should get back to the story.  END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn’t have taken yesterday off.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s always a mistake, especially since i haven’t read anything back. END
BEGIN NOW Trying to recap, Sawyer and Carter have just caught up, Sawyer’s neighbors are in holding.  END
BEGIN NOW The foreigners are a few precious steps away from infiltrating the military industrial complex.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s some military dudes about to bust in and make some noise.  END
BEGIN NOW We should close that loop before getting back to our heros. END
BEGIN NOW Night falls in Romania and three men in stealth combat gear are changing formation as they come up the target building.  END
BEGIN NOW They refer to themselves simple as Alpha, Bravo, and Delta.  END
BEGIN NOW Alpha keeps a mark on the guard by the back door.  END
BEGIN NOW Bravo and Delta go in to cut the power.  END
BEGIN NOW The lights flicker and go out.  END
BEGIN NOW A few seconds later, they kick back on with a dull glow.  END
BEGIN NOW Back up generator.  END
BEGIN NOW Didn’t figure they’d have one.  END
BEGIN NOW This is going to make things a bit more complicated.  END
BEGIN NOW Alpha makes his way to the guard, slow and silent.  END
BEGIN NOW On the hacking floor, everyone stops what they’re doing when the power flickers.  END
BEGIN NOW They stop talking and line up to take a gun from the cabinet on the wall.  END
BEGIN NOW No one says a word.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them are ex-military.  END
BEGIN NOW And they’ve been over the drills before.  END
BEGIN NOW Always have a backup plan. END
BEGIN NOW Alpha takes out his knife and readies to grab the guard around the neck.  END
BEGIN NOW He lunges and the guard starts to turn.  END
BEGIN NOW His knife misses the neck and slices a line up the guards shoulder.  END
BEGIN NOW The guard sprays bullets in several directions before landing a few in his assailant's leg.  END
BEGIN NOW The guard twists away and begins yelling at Alpha and pointing his gun at him.  END
BEGIN NOW Two bullets come in from the side and take off most of the guards face.  END
BEGIN NOW Delta and Bravo come running in from the darkness.  END
BEGIN NOW Alpha points at his leg.  END
BEGIN NOW They get a medical kit and patch him up, give him a shot of pain killers and enter the backdoor. END
BEGIN NOW The Romanians have split off into three teams.  END
BEGIN NOW one went up, one went down, and one stayed put.  END
BEGIN NOW They heard the report from the guard’s gun and everyone got low and slow and quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW The Americans know this is going to be a cat and mouse game of assault now.  END
BEGIN NOW So much for keeping it quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW They enter the building and there’s a stairwell in either corner that goes up.  END
BEGIN NOW There another one that goes down.  END
BEGIN NOW No elevators.  END
BEGIN NOW No one can hear a sound.  END
BEGIN NOW Delta takes out the cell jammer from his backpack and turns it up high, leaving it under the stairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Bravo takes a long range EMP from his pack and does the same.  END
BEGIN NOW All communication with the outside world from this building has been rendered null.  END
BEGIN NOW From the stairs, one of the hackers pokes his head around the corner.  END
BEGIN NOW He wastes no time and starts shooting.  END
BEGIN NOW He manages to hit Bravo in the shoulder before three large caliber bullets from the Americans put tennis ball sized holes in his chest.  END
BEGIN NOW From the other stairwell two men come running in firing automatic weapons, landing a few shots in Delta’s back.  END
BEGIN NOW the three americans put their backs together weapons drawn, desperate to make a last stand.  END
BEGIN NOW They take out one of their assailants before they’re joined by a guard from the basement, another from the front door.  END
BEGIN NOW The voice comes from behind the men in the stairs, he says in Romanian, “Leave one of them alive, kill the rest.” And before any hope of retaliation Alpha and Bravo are riddled with bullets.  END
BEGIN NOW One of the guards tackles Delta to the ground and breaks his arms.  END
BEGIN NOW He is dragged, bleeding and broken, down to the basement.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, he’s not coming back from his alive.  END
BEGIN NOW “Take the other two to the incinerator.  END
BEGIN NOW Let’s clean this shit up, we still have work to do.  END
BEGIN NOW You! get the power restored.  END
BEGIN NOW You two! find the sources of the jammers.  END
BEGIN NOW I want this operation back online within the hour.” The remaining men go about their jobs, some a little shaken.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them have been through this before.  END
BEGIN NOW They get everything up and running three hours later.  END
BEGIN NOW The boss makes a few phone calls and the number of guards doubles.  END
BEGIN NOW He makes a few more and they have a new location ready to go.  END
BEGIN NOW The trucks pull up and everyone takes a field trip to the new building.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a bunker this time.  END
BEGIN NOW It should last a while longer.  END
BEGIN NOW The wire the place up and less than 24 hours after the attacks they’re more secure than ever. END
BEGIN NOW Alright, that should take care of that for now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m still a good almost 3k behind in my word count for the day.  END
BEGIN NOW I have to leave to get cigarettes soon.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to kill the Americans.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe because that whole scene bored me to write it.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn’t enjoy it at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know anything about writing action sequences.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe because i haven’t read an action thriller in a long time.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m unfamiliar with the way it’s done.  END
BEGIN NOW Hell, i don’t even know how to describe those things.  END
BEGIN NOW And i know this project is becoming like 80% me ranting and maybe 20% actual story.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m ok with this, kind of.  END
BEGIN NOW Not really.  END
BEGIN NOW but, the point is that i get back in the habit of writing something.  END
BEGIN NOW If i want to yell with my fingers for a while, that’s fine.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s my problem.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not doing this for anyone else.  END
BEGIN NOW We can work on the discipline of actually writing a whole story next time.  END
BEGIN NOW For now, i need to focus on the act.  END
BEGIN NOW Just forcing myself to do it.  END
BEGIN NOW Thanksgiving is next week and that’s a whole set of problems right there.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s going to throw a wrench in the works.  END
BEGIN NOW Or at least it’s going to force me to not sleep much when i’m down there.  END
BEGIN NOW If i can manage to get ahead in the next few days, then I’ll feel better about it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m coming up to the two thirds mark.  END
BEGIN NOW and that’s something to celebrate.  END
BEGIN NOW And by Celebrate i mean plow up to 35k.  END
BEGIN NOW Just two thousand more words to go.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s two hours of continuous work.  END
BEGIN NOW you can do that.  END
BEGIN NOW you can sacrifice that much time to get there.  END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn’t waste so much of it writing about writing about it.  END
BEGIN NOW part of me wants to cut off from the main story and write some short story that has nothing to do with anything else.  END
BEGIN NOW I could.  END
BEGIN NOW I might do that too.  END
BEGIN NOW Think of it like an exercise.  END
BEGIN NOW Another hundred words or so and i’ve got to go get cigarettes before i forget and the shop closes.  END
BEGIN NOW Even though that’s in a few hours, i’d rather get it done now.  END
BEGIN NOW Or like eighty words from now.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m wondering if i’m going to run out of things to talk about.  END
BEGIN NOW I can never talk this much vocally.  END
BEGIN NOW Not unless there’s drugs or alcohol involved.  END
BEGIN NOW And even then it’s just drugged and drunk rambling.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose writing is like that too, except the writing only gets to hear their side of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Reading is interesting in that sense, because it’s like listening to someone go on about something but you can’t interrupt and ask questions.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re just along for the ride. END
BEGIN NOW “So what’s your endgame? What’s your plan? you can’t just bus tables and pay your rent and pretend that it’s enough for you.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t you want, i don’t know, more?” Carter and Sawyer have been smoking and drinking tall cans of beer down by the docks.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s early in the morning.  END
BEGIN NOW Like, four or so.  END
BEGIN NOW Carter’s sedan is parked down the street.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a nice car.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s wearing a nice casual suit.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s more than Sawyer could ever think about affording.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer is looking up at the foggy night sky and thinking about all of those things.  END
BEGIN NOW Funny that.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been running for ten years, his life is going nowhere.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s been content with very little.  END
BEGIN NOW His old friend did some time, had everything taken from him, now he’s running a company, he’s doing well for himself.  END
BEGIN NOW He exhales, long and slow, looking out over the water. END
BEGIN NOW “I haven’t given a lot of thought to that.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s been a van parked outside my apartment for the last few days.  END
BEGIN NOW I actually, wasn’t planning on going home tonight.  END
BEGIN NOW Something wasn’t sitting right, you know?” Carter nodded.  END
BEGIN NOW “I was actually going to get out of town.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t really know what i was going to do.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m getting tired of running.  END
BEGIN NOW Just when i started to feel settled in.  END
BEGIN NOW At this point, i’m so used to leaving town that it’s just a bummer.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t like it, but i’ve taken it was a matter of course.” Sawyer takes a long drink of beer. END
BEGIN NOW “One of the many reasons i wanted to catch up with you is offer you a spot.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m in need of an engineer right now, someone that knows what you know.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lot of money in our old hobby these days, and my company is getting overloaded with work requests.  END
BEGIN NOW I need someone to head up a team.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be like the old days, except you’ll be making money.  END
BEGIN NOW We’d be making money.  END
BEGIN NOW And it’s legit.  END
BEGIN NOW You won’t have to worry about the feds anymore.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well shit.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know how i can pass that up.  END
BEGIN NOW Where do I sign? Do i have to move? I don’t really care.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not tied to this job or my apartment.” END
BEGIN NOW “Glad to hear it.  END
BEGIN NOW And yeah, I’d move.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re in the city and getting to the office is going to be necessary.  END
BEGIN NOW Due to the nature of our work, we can’t do a lot of it from home.  END
BEGIN NOW It, uh, violates a few breaches of contract, and probably some laws.” END
BEGIN NOW “I see..” END
BEGIN NOW Carter reaches into his pocket and pushes a button on his phone.  END
BEGIN NOW He finishes his beer and crushes the can.  END
BEGIN NOW He puts out his cigarette when the first car shows up.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t have any lights.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the same kind of eerie black that the van was.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer turns around and has a look of panic on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s when the second and third cars show up. END
BEGIN NOW “What the hell is going on?” sawyer’s voice is full of panic at this point. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh calm down.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m surprised it took you this long.  END
BEGIN NOW I told you I made a deal to get out of the joint.” END
BEGIN NOW “Goddamnit! No! NOO!” An officer of the law, without a badge, with a gun approaches flanked by two more. END
BEGIN NOW “Timothy Sawyer! You are under arrest for violation of the computer fraud and abuse act! Keep your hands up and don’t move.” He grabs Sawyer and and turns him around, he puts a zip tie around his wrists.  END
BEGIN NOW “You have the right to remain silent.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t look so mad, old friend.  END
BEGIN NOW You should have seen this coming.  END
BEGIN NOW A high profile case like yours couldn’t go on forever.  END
BEGIN NOW They wanted to bring you in for years.  END
BEGIN NOW Finding you was difficult.  END
BEGIN NOW But you slipped up, everyone slips sooner or later.” END
BEGIN NOW “You bastard! I trusted you!” END
BEGIN NOW “Why? why on earth would you trust me.  END
BEGIN NOW I rotted away in jail! You trusted me because you knew me once, ten years ago.  END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn’t have trusted me then either.  END
BEGIN NOW How the hell did it take them so long to find you? They almost did, you know, back in Reno.  END
BEGIN NOW They were two days behind your ass.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the bus crash happened and that really threw a wrench in everything.  END
BEGIN NOW They thought you were dead.  END
BEGIN NOW When they brought me and my team on the case I knew you were still alive.  END
BEGIN NOW Your signature is still easy to find if you know where to look.” END
BEGIN NOW “Go to hell!” Sawyer said as they pushed him in the back seat of the black car. END
BEGIN NOW A federal agent walks over to Carter.  END
BEGIN NOW “Nice work, as usual.  END
BEGIN NOW This should put you in the clear.” END
BEGIN NOW “And you’ll get my record sorted out?” END
BEGIN NOW “I won’t, but someone will.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ll be in touch.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, i’m sure.” Carter lights another cigarette and walks down the street to his car.  END
BEGIN NOW Three black cars escort Sawyer to a very common looking office building downtown.  END
BEGIN NOW They drive into the basement parking garage and haul him in.  END
BEGIN NOW They take the elevator down three stories.  END
BEGIN NOW They take Sawyer into an interrogation room.  END
BEGIN NOW They let him stay in there for hours before anyone comes to talk to him.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s nervous, he’s scared, he doesn’t want to go to prison. END
BEGIN NOW The door opens and in walks a middle aged man in a grey suit.  END
BEGIN NOW He has a folder on him that’s several inches thick.  END
BEGIN NOW He tosses it down in front of Sawyer.  END
BEGIN NOW He walks behind him and pulls out a knife.  END
BEGIN NOW Carefully, he slips the knife under Sawyer’s wrist and cuts the zip tie. END
BEGIN NOW “Son, do you know what that is?” END
BEGIN NOW “Let me guess,” He says, rubbing his red marked wrists, “It’s my permanent record.” END
BEGIN NOW “Funny.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn’t tell me you were funny.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think that was in your file.” The man opens the folder and the inside is lists and lists and incident reports.  END
BEGIN NOW “This is a folder of what we think you might have been involved with.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s quite impressive.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t seen a file like this in a while.  END
BEGIN NOW We don’t get many in at your rank.  END
BEGIN NOW You can imagine, i’m sure, what it takes to bring in someone such as yourself.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of the higher profile cases like yours are, well, out of the country, and technically, not in our jurisdiction.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ok, so you have a file on me.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s great.  END
BEGIN NOW What are we doing here? Why am I here, shouldn’t i been in jail, a police station, something like that?” END
BEGIN NOW “Maybe if we caught you when we should have caught you.  END
BEGIN NOW That’s how we used to handle these things.  END
BEGIN NOW Not anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW Times have changed, we have a different president.  END
BEGIN NOW And he’s made it very clear that we’re not to destroy our precious natural resources.  END
BEGIN NOW Unless they don’t’ cooperate, of course.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be a different story. END
BEGIN NOW “I want to get to the point, because that would be best for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t you agree?” END
BEGIN NOW He doesn’t wait for acknowledgement, “Excellent.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know if you follow the news, but i can tell you that it’s always a lot worse than what’s reported.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re recruiting counter-cyber terrorist agents.  END
BEGIN NOW And people in your position aren’t in much of a… position...to uh, refuse.” Sawyer looks at the man in the interrogation room questionably.  END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t sure where he was going after he used the same word twice in that sentence.  END
BEGIN NOW It really threw everyone off track. END
BEGIN NOW “So you want to give me a job?” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, kind of.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t afford to pay you.  END
BEGIN NOW I mean, we could, but we’re not going to.  END
BEGIN NOW Instead, if you help us, we’ll help you.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like your friend back there.  END
BEGIN NOW He helped us out, and now he’s mostly a free man.  END
BEGIN NOW You just have to be aware of something.  END
BEGIN NOW We could call on you at anytime.  END
BEGIN NOW Any time we call you have to answer and be ready to serve your country.  END
BEGIN NOW These are matters of national security.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s either that, or we throw you in jail for, I don’t know, as long as we feel like it? I think we can do that.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ve pretty much got the OK to do damn near anything in the name of national security.  END
BEGIN NOW Also, your rap sheet is pretty extensive, that’ll add up to a lot of time, probably most of it in solitary.” He stops long enough to let it all sink in.  END
BEGIN NOW “It’s a yes or no situation for you.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m going with yes on this.  END
BEGIN NOW Fine.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll be your monkey.” END
BEGIN NOW “glad to hear it.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone will be in to escort you to your quarters.  END
BEGIN NOW We appreciate your cooperation.” END
BEGIN NOW “whatever,” sawyer says, echoing the war cry of his generation. END
BEGIN NOW You like that? a little betrayal? that’ll get the blood pumping.  END
BEGIN NOW I hope so.  END
BEGIN NOW I wasn’t expecting to do that.  END
BEGIN NOW But i didn’t know what else to do.  END
BEGIN NOW it would have just been boring if he got the job with his old friend and everything was going well.  END
BEGIN NOW But a plot twist leads to an attempt to tie the two storylines together.  END
BEGIN NOW Hopefully that works out.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know how else to reconcile the two threads.  END
BEGIN NOW This opens up the the possibility of actually ending the story around 50k which would be good.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not planning on keeping this story going after the month.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll go through and pull out what i like, but that’s all.  END
BEGIN NOW this is just an exercise this year.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been slacking on the writing for so long.  END
BEGIN NOW it feels good to get back in the habit of forcing myself to do something.  END
BEGIN NOW And its giving me a place to put all my thoughts.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s worth it to me.  END
BEGIN NOW that alone is enough to make all this worth it.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m trying to put it all into perspective and keep my motivation up.  END
BEGIN NOW By not lying to myself.  END
BEGIN NOW While hitting word count is the most important thing for me, keeping in check how i get there is also important.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just a guy trying to get to a goal.  END
BEGIN NOW nothing more. END
BEGIN NOW I did it again and went another day without even trying to get something down.  END
BEGIN NOW Social obligations and oh shit i have to email my mom.  END
BEGIN NOW and that’s taken care of.  END
BEGIN NOW going home for the holidays is going to take a chunk of time out of my writing.  END
BEGIN NOW And i need to move this off line for those few days.  END
BEGIN NOW When i return i’ll have about two days to wrap this monster up.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s four days to really crank out 15k.  END
BEGIN NOW Woof.  END
BEGIN NOW in that light tonight i have to get as far as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW and i’m home alone for the moment and have some nice jazz music and a bit of tea to keep it going.  END
BEGIN NOW TOmorrow i have to make a trip to the hospital, but i’m planning on lugging the laptop along to get something done during the excursion.  END
BEGIN NOW So much to do and my faith in this story isn’t all that high.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of me just wants to get it over with.  END
BEGIN NOW The golden ratio point, when it good writing you hit ‘em with everything you’ve got.  END
BEGIN NOW In my writing, you struggle to do anything because you’re not even sure what’s happening or why and part of you just want to go to the president and have him push the red button and end of story, no one wins, no great victory.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like life.  END
BEGIN NOW A big push in the beginning, a lousy middle section, and an end that leaves you with nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW A cautionary tale, Aesop’s fable for the modern age.  END
BEGIN NOW A predictable pile of trash.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no heros in this story.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure anyone really has any redeaming qualities.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s no attachment to anyone, they seem thin and disposible.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m writing in 2D.  END
BEGIN NOW but at least i’m writing SOMETHING.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s what i’m trying to remind myself.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s getting to the point where i’m spending more time writing about writing because the actually writing strikes me as trite and dull.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t feel like the reader could possibly be invested in anything i’ve written here.  END
BEGIN NOW But as they say, the first 10000 or so words are all trash.  END
BEGIN NOW The first notebook should just be thrown out.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t try to turn it into more than it is.  END
BEGIN NOW Just leave the trash in the trash and move on.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to re read this pile next month and trim it up and make some basic edits, but other than that… well, it can all just go hell.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i’ll go back to writing pointless bar narratives about going nowhere 30 somethings and barflys and pretty bartenders and the futility of it all.  END
BEGIN NOW Or day in the life melodramas.  END
BEGIN NOW Stories beyond that scope tend to be out of my reach.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not capable of writing another Westworld, Illuminatus!, or On the Road.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been called a wannabe bukowski before, and i’m not sure if i like it, but it’s not inaccurate.  END
BEGIN NOW Easily said in my 20s.  END
BEGIN NOW Now in my 30s, it’s not much different.  END
BEGIN NOW The idealism is gone.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not single anymore, so the wandering the streets of the city in a drugged and drunken stupor rambling narrative would only be pieced together from flashes of what might be memory, but it’s been too long to really remember if it happened to me at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t feel like i’m trying to be someone else in my writing most of the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, this whole story is forced and probably comes off that way.  END
BEGIN NOW But that was kind of the point.  END
BEGIN NOW i wanted to write something about disgust from the point of view of a disgusting person as well.  END
BEGIN NOW The story would just be following a real lowest common denominator type that’s slumming it and treating people badly while ranting about how everything makes them sick.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve touched on it before, but maybe i really want to explore that deeper.  END
BEGIN NOW Being the in the city has a way of bringing that out of me.  END
BEGIN NOW what once was the glittering gold lined streets of San Francisco turns into a shit stained sidewalk, littered with used needles, crackheads and meth addicts, tech kids that took the fast track with mom and dad’s money to write the next big app, stepping over bums that used to be able to afford a house here, making their way from the new beer garden to the new hot restaurant, to the new luxury condo.  END
BEGIN NOW doing their new lines of blow and banging their new tinder date on the balcony.  END
BEGIN NOW There was a time i found all of that facinating and just a weird part of life and now i don’t feel so good about any of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i need a return to the woods for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe in december i’ll spend a lot of time in the park feeding squirrels and sitting in silence.  END
BEGIN NOW That might be a damn good idea.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t even want to go back to writing this story right now, i mostly want to get some thoughts down that have been troubling.  END
BEGIN NOW think of it as a therapy session, where the unwilling reader is given a well trimmed beard and a pair of spectacles and a note pad.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m just going to lie back on the couch for a while and stare at the ceiling and talk about whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW Your usual rates may apply. END
BEGIN NOW I managed to wake up around 7 this morning, only to take a nap at 2 and wake again at 8:30.  END
BEGIN NOW I had a good hangover going, would have been the perfect time to write for a few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW BUt that’s passed and i missed the opportunity.  END
BEGIN NOW I had to pass the radio station over to some Tom Waits stuff, even if the words in songs can throw me off sometimes, i needed to go somewhere a little more morose.  END
BEGIN NOW I think the depression has been sitting around my room, hanging out on the couch with me.  END
BEGIN NOW Telling me to do things like go out and head to bar down the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Telling me to take another break.  END
BEGIN NOW wait for inspiration to hit me upside the head.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t think it works that way anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW I think it’s better to keep hammering away, free write or just rant and ramble until something hits you.  END
BEGIN NOW When i was working in kitchens, i’d have these flashes of inspiration and never could get to a piece of paper soon enough to remember anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, most of it was probably throw away.  END
BEGIN NOW But just having that notebook in my back pocket like i used to.  END
BEGIN NOW If i’m to continue writing these things, that’s going to have to be a thing again.  END
BEGIN NOW if something occurs to me, write it down.  END
BEGIN NOW I should be turning to the piano if i need a brain break.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t let it rest, it does that all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW Now it’s just lazy and looking for excuses not to do anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Put on a movie, go get drunk, take a nap.  END
BEGIN NOW Wake up tomorrow when you’re fresh and ready to go.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t been fresh and ready to go in twenty years.  END
BEGIN NOW I just wake up feeling more tired every day no matter how much or little sleep i get.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the time is spent laying in bed tossing and turning, sweating and kicking the cats off my legs.  END
BEGIN NOW How easy their life is, but how limited.  END
BEGIN NOW stuck inside, sleeping all the time, eating, shiting, must be kinda nice.  END
BEGIN NOW But i don’t think i could have a whole life like that.  END
BEGIN NOW I would be too restless.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d be the cat that waits by the door, eager to escape.  END
BEGIN NOW Or the caged bird that never shuts up.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’re gona lock me up, i’m gonna be loud about it. END
BEGIN NOW blacking out in three two one down one to go and throw it away the baby in the bath water and the walter where are you you song of a bitch i’ll get you you bastard and faster we go and trip and fall and flurry and falter because walter is wrong all the time and worry wort wert and ramble and please stop talking to me i’m just trying to get something down and doesn’t anyone understand that and doesn’t anyone know what it’s like to just try and get something down and done and have a thing to go look i made this but don’t look too close because there’s blood stains and seman stains and the words are all wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW And don’t look at it too close because i didn’t really mean for anyone to see it, but i just wanted you to know that i made a thing and that’s cool.  END
BEGIN NOW And that’s all the sense of accomplishment i ever wanted. END
BEGIN NOW The fat man will tell you everything because he’s shoveling shit up his nose and noise is all he knows.  END
BEGIN NOW His shoes are falling apart on his feet, but barely, his pants are loose like a pirates wrapped in a rope belt so you can hang yourself with it, if push comes to shove and worse comes to worst.  END
BEGIN NOW The wurst thing you can do, well i never sausage a thing like that in my life.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t have any beef with you but a good porking would do everyone some good.  END
BEGIN NOW Old wristy twisty flaunt and fail and flail the flogging.  END
BEGIN NOW Fogging the mirror after the shower, a little meatier.  END
BEGIN NOW Lean on me, and we can bone out and about and around and down and through thoughts we’ll get there evertually, the path is long and twisted and lonely all the same, and you can walk down it a thousand times and still find a new rock you haven’t turned over and over and red rover red rover send anyone on over because i broke the chain even if fleetwood mac says you never can, but what did they ever know except a bunch of rumours and brunch is a tumor on the breakfast food pyramid.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know where that was going but damn do i love eggs.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to take a bath but there’s a draught, a draft, a drout, a doubt and trout fishing in america changed my life, for better or worse or till death do us part we’ll never know and knowing is half the battle and war never changes.  END
BEGIN NOW If the other half of the battle is rambing John cotton feild and we all get in the truck at the end of the day with our chains a rattling and foreman takes the picks and the shovels and we could take him if we wanted to.  END
BEGIN NOW we could jump him and get the keys and make our escape and run like hell because running is all we know and we don’t know much except the desire for sweet freedom and range and home to put on it, but nowhere to stay and nothing to say except, i’m sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW My life is an apology and aposthrophe an apostolic, alcoholic, alchemical all state tri city subterreanian trainwreck.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m sorry, i’m so sorry, don’t worry, don’t cry for me artisinal cheese shop workers of america.  END
BEGIN NOW Chedder, i hardly know her.  END
BEGIN NOW You chedder, you brought her here.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, either way, we’re going to have to find a way to bury the body so come with me, i know a good creek.Not far from here.  END
BEGIN NOW Here take this shovel, let me find the bone saw.  END
BEGIN NOW See? that wasn’t so bad.  END
BEGIN NOW The blood will come out, or we can just ditch the clothes and go swimming.  END
BEGIN NOW This swamp isn’t big enough for the two of us to chew with us and breaking bread and loafing around because we’ve gotten crusted any way you slice it, it’s still pretty crumby.  END
BEGIN NOW You were always an against the grain kinda guy, but is going gluten free really the answer.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe their are no answers, maybe this is all one big misunderstanding and sandy hook and hurricane sandy and a cool shandy on a hot day were just myths.  END
BEGIN NOW and maybe mythology is more important than the reality.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s all reflective, don’t you see.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d hold a mirror up to things but i’m too caught up in the fascination of my own reflection to bother.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m too caught up in my own hang ups to hang out.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m caught.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m too.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m very.  END
BEGIN NOW variables.  END
BEGIN NOW integers, strings and sing a song of sick pants, bro. END
BEGIN NOW In a parallel universe tom waits and thom york are yodeling salesman that go door to door selling whatever they think is cool.  END
BEGIN NOW In a pair of el universidades, someone is going to school.  END
BEGIN NOW possible several people.  END
BEGIN NOW They will rise up the ranks and be great scientists and until we be the scientists in the white house and the mayor's office and the city halls and have people making and enforcing laws that have a background is something besides making laws and enforcing them, until then we’ll be stuck in a loop of getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing and no one can break the mold and the mild sense of dread that comes with it all.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re never going to get anywhere because no one thought enough ahead to bring a gas can and it wouldn’t matter anyway, we’d just end up drinking it because the label was wrong and said prune juice and i was too full of shit and and and and and.  END
BEGIN NOW Running on, run on sentence.  END
BEGIN NOW Be free! take on your own life and don’t let me stop you.  END
BEGIN NOW word vomit and endless streams of shit and piss.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s never too late until it comes up or out of you.  END
BEGIN NOW You can’t stuff the excrement back inside you.  END
BEGIN NOW All you can do is try to clean yourself off.  END
BEGIN NOW What a sham.  END
BEGIN NOW what a scam and wow buddy.  END
BEGIN NOW thanks for listening.  END
BEGIN NOW this has been broadcast of whatever man.  END
BEGIN NOW don’t worry about it.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s cool.  END
BEGIN NOW stay calm.  END
BEGIN NOW keep calm and bury the hatchet.  END
BEGIN NOW The old battle axe and now my stomach is upset and i don’t know what i said, but i do know that if i wasn’t backspacing some damn much i’d be in a better place by now and that might help me sleep at night but i doubt it.  END
BEGIN NOW the only thing that helps me sleep are drugs.  END
BEGIN NOW Like i told my old coworkers, shot of bourbon, shot of nyquil, fat rip on a bowl of weed and count backwards from 10 and boom, out like a light.  END
BEGIN NOW like the street light i used to pop the bb gun i got for christmas and the guy from the city came out to fix it and found me and told me to knock that shit off. END
BEGIN NOW Or when i was a kid and found out i could short out the lightbulbs by spraying them with water on the top and they would fizzle out.  END
BEGIN NOW And my parents would get mad because the light bulbs kept dying and no one knew why and i was more fascinated with how something like a spray bottle could turn out the lights.  END
BEGIN NOW It came with the desire to dismantle things.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything, really.  END
BEGIN NOW lego syndrome.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve always been curious about putting things together and pulling them apart and wondering how they work but now i’m getting older and my brain is slower and most of it doesn't have the same charm, it’s not as interesting, or new to me.  END
BEGIN NOW I’d like to be one of those people that has a workbench in their garage and makes things out of wood or builds robots.  END
BEGIN NOW knows how to solder things together and write simple programs to do things like turn the lights off by sending a text message, or something like that. END
BEGIN NOW I’ve had this blister on my left index finger for the last two days and it’s getting impossible not to fiddle with it.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s right next to my thumb and my thumb just wants to push on it all the time and watch how the pus underneath pushes the skin around, trying to get free.  END
BEGIN NOW And Sawyer is sitting around like, hey boss, so you left me in this basement under a kind of house arrest slash government contract situation.  END
BEGIN NOW you gonna get around to that? Or am i just gonna sit here.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s cool.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s not like i was that interesting anyway. END
BEGIN NOW and Mr. President is passed out on his desk in the oval office in a pile of morphine and coke and spilled brandy.  END
BEGIN NOW I just imagine that’s what presidents drink.  END
BEGIN NOW old brandy.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe because of the el presidente brand of brandy.  END
BEGIN NOW that might have something to do with it.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s really upset that operation shut it down ended with a whimper.  END
BEGIN NOW he doesn't like it when things end with a whimper.  END
BEGIN NOW he likes it when they end in a bang and zoom and kablooie.  END
BEGIN NOW He likes telling the military to go for it, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Send some people in, level it out.  END
BEGIN NOW Turn the dessert into glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Turn the forest into a parking lot.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes i wonder if that isn’t the best course of action.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not sure, i’m no expert.  END
BEGIN NOW my hippy dippy leanings of reform and nonviolence haven’t always gotten things done.  END
BEGIN NOW Then again, the violence and whatnot seem to just perpetuate the problem.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not really a problem solver.  END
BEGIN NOW Like Barbara Kingsolver and her poisonwood bible.  END
BEGIN NOW barbara bar bar barbar barbarians.  END
BEGIN NOW so named, according to a history nerd friend of mine because the romans thought they were say bar bar, all the time.  END
BEGIN NOW we name things the way we hear them.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it sticks.  END
BEGIN NOW A turn of phrase, a toss of the coin.  END
BEGIN NOW And at the end of it all, we have a story to tell.  END
BEGIN NOW The wacky tale of language and how it got here.  END
BEGIN NOW How we got here with all these words.  END
BEGIN NOW So many words and we don’t know the half of them.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re a bunch of dummies.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s my grand conclusion.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have saved that for the end.  END
BEGIN NOW The big finale.  END
BEGIN NOW the wow finish. END
BEGIN NOW 38000 END
BEGIN NOW I’m going into the last fifth of the story soon.  END
BEGIN NOW 12000 words to go and after the first 38k that doesn’t seem like too much.  END
BEGIN NOW I could crank it all out by the weekend if i really tried.  END
BEGIN NOW But really trying is getting more difficult, hence the last few pages of nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing at all of value.  END
BEGIN NOW But whatever, i’m not going to pretend that there’s any value to what i’ve been writing anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW Like i keep reminding myself, that’s not the point.  END
BEGIN NOW Don’t get attached to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Be ok with ruining everyone’s lives.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s not even that many characters.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i should write something about one of the rouge counter terrorism hacker cells in america.  END
BEGIN NOW i didn’t write anything about the chinese either.  END
BEGIN NOW they’re rather big players.  END
BEGIN NOW or Russia.  END
BEGIN NOW i wanted to keep it a bit simpler.  END
BEGIN NOW but that’s also kind of limiting.  END
BEGIN NOW and limits are good for forcing creativity.  END
BEGIN NOW Still, creativity hasn’t really been my strongest trait here.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m not trying to reinvent any wheels.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just trying to get something done.  END
BEGIN NOW Every year i tell myself i’m going to do this and i’m going to finish this mad project.  END
BEGIN NOW But this year was the first in a long time that it really feels like something i can finish, to a degree.  END
BEGIN NOW Hopefully, not like last time i finished and the story was somewhere near half way but i hit the word goal and then got stuck in editing.  END
BEGIN NOW and that never ended and the story wasn’t even finished at all.  END
BEGIN NOW i guess the trick is to finish the story first.  END
BEGIN NOW then edit.  END
BEGIN NOW then rewrite.  END
BEGIN NOW draft 0 is a good way to think about it.  END
BEGIN NOW null draft.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s doesn’t even count, really.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s like an extended outline of gibberish.  END
BEGIN NOW maybe something can be pieced out of it.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe not.  END
BEGIN NOW but i’m not really counting on it.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i’ll be able to wrap up the story before 50k then just write some shorts to round out my word count.  END
BEGIN NOW in actuality, i’ll probably just rant a lot anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW so whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW this has been a good two thousand word warm up. END
BEGIN NOW “Mr. President!” END
BEGIN NOW The voice of his aide was in the door again and Mr. President’s face was covered in crushed morphine pill dust.  END
BEGIN NOW His glass of brandy had spilled, mixing with the pill dust and turning into a very expensive, muddy adhesive.  END
BEGIN NOW He shot up from the desk, blinking and disoriented.  END
BEGIN NOW Wondering why this person was yelling at him.  END
BEGIN NOW His wife and kids and the family dog had been taken to their safe house slash summer get away.  END
BEGIN NOW There had been threats against the white house, normally, he’d be operating in the bunker.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought it best to get blasted on pain meds and have the red phone nearby.  END
BEGIN NOW He thought he needed to clear his head by soaking it in old liquor and narcotics.  END
BEGIN NOW His aide came in and gave him a rag to wipe his face off.  END
BEGIN NOW The aide made a motion to start cleaning up the mess of the desk when the president stopped him. END
BEGIN NOW “Get a glass, uhh what’s your name?” END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, get a glass, have a seat.” END
BEGIN NOW The aide, now named Thompson took a crystal glass from the drink cart in the corner. END
BEGIN NOW “And bring over that bottle or brown stuff.” END
BEGIN NOW There were three on the cart, Thompson made a gesture to the president to indicate which one he should be grabbing.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President wasn’t paying attention.  END
BEGIN NOW “Sir, is there a particular bottle you’d like?” END
BEGIN NOW “OH shit, it doesn’t matter, it’s all the same once it gets in the blood.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s all old and oaky, none of us are going to tell the difference.” END
BEGIN NOW The aide was a little taken aback by the most powerful man in the world and his candid attitude.  END
BEGIN NOW He pick one of the crystal decanters half full of brown liquor and brought it over to the desk. END
BEGIN NOW “excellent choice,” the president said with a he didn’t really care but was glad that there was a bottle present again at the table look on his face.  END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, give me your glass.” The president took the glasses and pour each of them a solid three fingers of whatever it was.  END
BEGIN NOW he scraped up some of the morphine mud off the desk and mixed it in to the liquor, using a silver letter opener as a spoon.  END
BEGIN NOW He gave the cloudy glass to Thompson, who looked at it questionably.  END
BEGIN NOW “To your health.” said the president, clinking glasses with a reluctant aide.  END
BEGIN NOW But when the president invites in you in for a drink laced with narcotics, you’re not really in a position to say no.  END
BEGIN NOW that would be rude.  END
BEGIN NOW We can’t have that kind of rude behaviour happening in the oval office. END
BEGIN NOW The aide, known as Thompson, managed to choke down a healthy gulp of the cloudy brown liquor before coughing.  END
BEGIN NOW His body was shuddering and his blood was very confused about the sudden influx of new chemicals.  END
BEGIN NOW the morphine was going fisticuffs with the adderall and stimulants he took on a regular basis to keep up with the odd schedule of white house work.  END
BEGIN NOW Long hours, no real time zone.  END
BEGIN NOW He was lucky he didn’t have a wife and kids, The President said.  END
BEGIN NOW You often have to choose between your work and them.  END
BEGIN NOW And often they can seem weak and needy.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s difficult to maintain a real relationship with anyone under the circumstances of professional political work at a high level.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t have time to babysit the kids, or listen to whatever it is your wife wants to complain about THAT day.  END
BEGIN NOW You don’t have time to just sit around and watch the game. END
BEGIN NOW Thompson is listening and looking at the pile of crushed drug mud and the glasses with booze older than his father and the glasses and booze are probably worth more than what he takes home in a year.  END
BEGIN NOW And this man that’s ranting to him about not having time while he’s been passed out in a stupor in his office most of the day. END
BEGIN NOW “For christ’s sake, i didn’t invite you in here to have a drink just to listen to myself talk.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sorry, sir, i didn’t mean to…” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes yes, whatever,” The president takes another gulp of his concoction.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson follows suite.  END
BEGIN NOW “Can we drop the formalities.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i just want to take a break from hearing about people i’ve sent off to die and their grieving widows.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe i just want to sit around and bullshit with someone for a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Do you have a dog at home?” END
BEGIN NOW “No, sir, I’ve been thinking about getting a cat.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, to each his own.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose you’re not home enough to own a dog.  END
BEGIN NOW No matter.  END
BEGIN NOW My dogs have brought me much comfort and joy over the years.  END
BEGIN NOW I highly recommend it.  END
BEGIN NOW It gives you something to look forward to at the end of the day.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, sir.” Thompson says it like a very young man listening to much older man give him life advice, which isn’t too far off from the truth. END
BEGIN NOW “You see Thompson,” He pauses to take another gulp of his drink.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson does the same and is starting to feel it.  END
BEGIN NOW “I’m responsible for a great many lives.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes i make the right call, and lives are saved.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, people die because of me.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it’s ok, because they were bad people and they needed to die so that people that weren’t as bad don’t have to die.  END
BEGIN NOW Something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know why i’m telling you this, but i sent three good men to their deaths the other day.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s really not sitting with me well.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to bomb the tar out of the people that killed them.  END
BEGIN NOW But i’m told that i can’t do that.  END
BEGIN NOW and that the repercussions would be disastrous.” He says the last part while waving his hands around in a kind of oh whatever eye rolling gesture.  END
BEGIN NOW “I say, fuck ‘em.  END
BEGIN NOW let ‘em burn.  END
BEGIN NOW It doesn’t weigh on my conscious any more when they deserve it.” END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President throws back the last of his drink and motions for Thompson to hand him his glass.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson finishes his drink and the president mixes another round.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s getting a little wobbly.  END
BEGIN NOW His basic motor functions are present enough that he pours the liquor and throws some of the morphine sludge in and stirs them up with the silver letter opener.  END
BEGIN NOW He slides Thompson the glass and they clink them together and take a healthy sip each. END
BEGIN NOW “you’re a good kid, Thompson.  END
BEGIN NOW thanks for coming in to see me.” The aide is thinking about why he came into this office in the first place.  END
BEGIN NOW he’s a little fuzzy on if he was sent here to get the president or if he was called in.  END
BEGIN NOW Wasn’t there something he was supposed to get him for? It was a little late now, they were both a little less than presentable.  END
BEGIN NOW Looking a little less than presidential. END
BEGIN NOW “You like baseball? National pastime, i can get tickets to anything.  END
BEGIN NOW Perks of the job, i suppose.  END
BEGIN NOW We should go to a game together.  END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing next week?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nothing, sir.” Thompson is a little cock-eyed. END
BEGIN NOW “Great.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ll have someone arrange everything.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever, i’m the fucking President of the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be great.” The most powerful man in the world takes another long gulp of his concoction, puts the glass down and blinks a few dozen times.  END
BEGIN NOW “Now, if you’ll excuse me, Thompson.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve got some work to do.” The president closes his eyes and promptly starts snoring. END
BEGIN NOW Thompson finishes his drink and puts the bottle back on the drink tray.  END
BEGIN NOW He using a very nice napkin to wipe his glass clean and wrap it up in his pocket.  END
BEGIN NOW he wants something to remember this by.  END
BEGIN NOW having a crystal glass with the great seal on them was as good a memento as anything. END
BEGIN NOW The most fantastic thing that happened, what was the thing.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn't download a copy of the work i've done so far.  END
BEGIN NOW Meaning, I have nothing to go one while i'm at my parents house for thanksgiving.  END
BEGIN NOW Meaning! I'm flying blind again with a blank page staring at me and it's mocking me and i'm at the table I grew up eating breakfast at, which is strange because I don't think i've written anything here (ever?) at least since high school but probably earlier.  END
BEGIN NOW That doesn't matter.  END
BEGIN NOW What does matter is that I have a chance to write something because I decided to waste the last 24 hours by sleeping.  END
BEGIN NOW I get it when Hemm said to write while you're hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW It makes sense.  END
BEGIN NOW Digestion slows everything down and sometimes puts you right to sleep because it's such a strenuous process.  END
BEGIN NOW Write while you're hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW Write while drunk and hungry.  END
BEGIN NOW Edit sober.  END
BEGIN NOW Never eat again.  END
BEGIN NOW That seems to be the key.  END
BEGIN NOW Just never eat anything.  END
BEGIN NOW That's fine.  END
BEGIN NOW Cigarettes and booze it is.  END
BEGIN NOW Oh how young I feel.  END
BEGIN NOW Getting drunk on Mom's tequila.  END
BEGIN NOW Sitting around the kitchen table.  END
BEGIN NOW Icons and family pictures everywhere.  END
BEGIN NOW Is there a guide for mothers on decorating the house after the kids have moved out? Does it include kitschy everything, photos of the kids, photos of other people's kids.  END
BEGIN NOW Cut outs of old Far Side comics (might be my dad's doing), Tiles with prints on them, I can see one from where i'm sitting, it has a cow on it, it's captioned, eat chicken. END
BEGIN NOW Remembering where i'm at in the story is a tricky business.  END
BEGIN NOW Last thing I remember writing was about the president and his aide getting wasted and talking it out.  END
BEGIN NOW The leaves Sawyer in work/custody, Carter free and out there, Romania in the bunker, almost ready to strike on to phase two.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever that might be.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that's everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW I didn't do a lot of characters on this story.  END
BEGIN NOW A few that kind of popped in at the time and have since gone away forever.  END
BEGIN NOW Kind of a new tactic for me.  END
BEGIN NOW Not used to that one.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually, everything is a multi threaded mismash and everyone is everywhere and that's that.  END
BEGIN NOW I tried to weave them all together but it usually came off as a bunch of different stories that had nothing to do with each other.  END
BEGIN NOW Which is kind of ok, if you like those 'here is a world and a bunch of different scenes with a bunch of different people in them kind of things.  END
BEGIN NOW Like that movie, Love, Actually.  END
BEGIN NOW Had like 12 threads.  END
BEGIN NOW Each one would dip in and out and culminated around christmas with conclusions a plenty.  END
BEGIN NOW Conflicts all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW But you had all these different versions of what love was actually supposed to be.  END
BEGIN NOW It was cute.  END
BEGIN NOW A real tear jerking movie, if you're empathic.  END
BEGIN NOW Kind of, oh here we go again all over, if you're not.  END
BEGIN NOW No judgements here.  END
BEGIN NOW Just trying to remember it for whatever it was.  END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I didn't want to write something like that.  END
BEGIN NOW So I have a main character, and I tried to set up a conflict in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW That was sort of my thought process, if I had one at all.  END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to set up some kind of conflict for the main guy to get into at some point.  END
BEGIN NOW In the process of doing that, I wanted to set up some micro conflicts, maybe some of them turn into something bigger.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really know.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm not really following whatever it is i'm doing.  END
BEGIN NOW At this point i'm talking about doing it more than doing it.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess i'm a metaphor for everyone i've ever talked to.  END
BEGIN NOW And my metaphor I mean i'm one of them.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm just writing it down instead of slurring it at you while you're bobbing your head around, looking for ANYONE ELSE YOU MIGHT KNOW at this STUPID PARTY.  END
BEGIN NOW That's seem a pretty accurate description of my writing.  END
BEGIN NOW I once described my favorite musician's last album as 'Most of the songs feel like you're slow dancing with someone that would much rather be dancing with someone else.' And I really love that.  END
BEGIN NOW I think that feeling has followed me around my whole life.  END
BEGIN NOW Along with the afore stated being at a party metaphor.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know if I like the metaphor as much as I like the accents I put on it.  END
BEGIN NOW The emphasis is really special to me.  END
BEGIN NOW It speaks volumes.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really care if I just dance around the story at this point.  END
BEGIN NOW I mention and acknowledge it's existence, but i'm refusing to participate.  END
BEGIN NOW It reminds me of physical education in high school.  END
BEGIN NOW I knew it was happening and on what days.  END
BEGIN NOW But I never brought my uniform since they made the rule that you couldn't play if you didn't bring it.  END
BEGIN NOW What a great loophole, I thought.  END
BEGIN NOW And who fucking is ever going to care about my attendance at P.E.  END
BEGIN NOW In my last year of high school is spotty. END
BEGIN NOW I'm betting my batting average at this point is 70/30 of commentary vs.  END
BEGIN NOW actual story.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really have a problem with that since with every word I write i'm reinforcing the ratio and pushing further on the commentary side of it.  END
BEGIN NOW I've gone a bit meta with commenting on the comments i've been making about a story that I really don't care about.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't really know what's left to do with the story.  END
BEGIN NOW I kind of want to kill everyone in it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just have everything go so wrong that I end up writing death scenes for everyone all week.  END
BEGIN NOW Ten Thousand Words of people dying.  END
BEGIN NOW How's that for a conclusion.  END
BEGIN NOW My god right now is a word counter.  END
BEGIN NOW From his position high above me, overlooking this whole business, he's like oh you're almost on target for hitting your daily goal.  END
BEGIN NOW By which he means half way.  END
BEGIN NOW If that included what I didn't and should have wrote yesterday.  END
BEGIN NOW Which I didn't.  END
BEGIN NOW I slept all day.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn't have eaten anything and then gotten sleepy and then went to sleep.  END
BEGIN NOW I should have stayed awake, never eaten, drank more, wrote more and got it done.  END
BEGIN NOW This month is about winners.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's how winners work.  END
BEGIN NOW Sit down, shut up and do it.  END
BEGIN NOW Hammer it out, tell everyone to fuck off and get it done.  END
BEGIN NOW Just like my father used to tell me about house chores.  END
BEGIN NOW Do it like you want to get it done.  END
BEGIN NOW And I want to get this done because the first several hundred thousand words you write are going to be garbage.  END
BEGIN NOW And i'm making peace with that.  END
BEGIN NOW I'm in an effort to crank out that huge pile of shit before I can shine.  END
BEGIN NOW I never meant for anyone to read this.  END
BEGIN NOW And if you do read this, i'm so very sorry.  END
BEGIN NOW That was a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW This was a mistake.  END
BEGIN NOW And i'm sorry about all of that. END
BEGIN NOW When I lose steam ranting and writing about writing the story, I guess it's time to go back to the actually story.  END
BEGIN NOW Whatever.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't have to but I should, which is a defeated punk rock way of looking at things.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't have to do this! But, yeah, I guess I should get it out of the way. END
BEGIN NOW The accommodations weren't even that bad.  END
BEGIN NOW That surprised Sawyer a lot.  END
BEGIN NOW He was thinking he'd be in some kind of concentration camp situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Or some kind of cube farm with other people like him that got caught.  END
BEGIN NOW He figured that there'd at least be someone to talk to.  END
BEGIN NOW But no, he was basically left alone.  END
BEGIN NOW They gave him a console set up and a cot.  END
BEGIN NOW They slid meals under the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a place to shit and piss, a place to sleep and a place to work.  END
BEGIN NOW And he was under surveillance the whole time.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't care.  END
BEGIN NOW He would spend most of his time on the console.  END
BEGIN NOW It didn't take him long to get an environment set up.  END
BEGIN NOW A place he liked to write code, to poke holes in things.  END
BEGIN NOW He started working immediately.  END
BEGIN NOW Something snapped in his mind as soon as Cut flipped his switch.  END
BEGIN NOW Soon as he was finally caught.  END
BEGIN NOW That piece of his mind that was so concerned about not getting caught shifted.  END
BEGIN NOW Time to try something else.  END
BEGIN NOW And with that state of mind, having been spurred, having been on the run for so long, having the last person in the world that he had an actual relationship with turn him in.  END
BEGIN NOW The last person he remembered trusting.  END
BEGIN NOW The last person he'd looked in the eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW Now that was all gone.  END
BEGIN NOW Now he was alone in this basement.  END
BEGIN NOW He had a console that was basically a virtual machine.  END
BEGIN NOW Meaning that He could cloud store things, closely monitored.  END
BEGIN NOW But when ever he went to sleep the powers that be would wipe the machine clean, and he'd start fresh.  END
BEGIN NOW He could write code and save that to the cloud storage they gave him.  END
BEGIN NOW But any local changes were null.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like having to set up from scratch every day.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's what he would do.  END
BEGIN NOW He wrote scripts to do this for him as soon as he figured out what was going on.  END
BEGIN NOW He put those on the cloud, and the powers let him keep those, they allowed him work more.  END
BEGIN NOW That was ok.  END
BEGIN NOW They had a monitor on his internet access.  END
BEGIN NOW They could see everything going over their wire.  END
BEGIN NOW He tried some encryption tricks to see if there was persistence.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to know his limits before he would commit the code he wanted to write right now.  END
BEGIN NOW He had to know that no one watching him could understand just what was really going on. END
BEGIN NOW They knew that it wouldn't take him long to figure out how the whole system worked.  END
BEGIN NOW And sure there was a few steps that were just to test how good he really was.  END
BEGIN NOW Just to make sure they really had the right guy.  END
BEGIN NOW You could never be sure with these hacker guys.  END
BEGIN NOW When you asked them to turn in their friends, it was always hit or miss.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes they didn't care at all.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd change their tune and point at anyone to get themselves out the situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to get themselves out.  END
BEGIN NOW They didn't count on Sawyer being smarter than them.  END
BEGIN NOW The arrogance threw them off.  END
BEGIN NOW Just because they were watching didn't mean that they understood.  END
BEGIN NOW And he found a way to encrypt his notes.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a way to get past the watchful eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a way to work, and continue his work.  END
BEGIN NOW That they were counting on.  END
BEGIN NOW But his work was fragmented.  END
BEGIN NOW No one could get an idea of his big picture.  END
BEGIN NOW He started from scratch every day.  END
BEGIN NOW At the end of every day he made a little progress. END
BEGIN NOW They told him that he had a target.  END
BEGIN NOW They told him that we know this much.  END
BEGIN NOW We know there were hackers in Romania that had gotten this far.  END
BEGIN NOW He could stop them.  END
BEGIN NOW He could null their work with a few days worth of keystrokes.  END
BEGIN NOW That wasn't hard for him.  END
BEGIN NOW With Sawyer on their side, the cat in this cat and mouse game had weapons.  END
BEGIN NOW He could defend himself.  END
BEGIN NOW He could block and keep the cat at bay. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in the heart of Romania, in a bunker in the forest with nothing but an old dirt road used by the fire service that could connect them to the outside world, everyone involved was getting frustrated.  END
BEGIN NOW They had cracked the password file.  END
BEGIN NOW They'd tried them all.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing was working.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like 6 months of work had just been thrown out.  END
BEGIN NOW All because Sawyer changed the password policy, the encryption method used by those services, beefed up the firewall.  END
BEGIN NOW But he left a backdoor for them.  END
BEGIN NOW The easiest way to keep track of your enemy in this situation was to give them the way inside.  END
BEGIN NOW There were some suspicions around their camp.  END
BEGIN NOW And the team split in half.  END
BEGIN NOW Half working on the back door Sawyer had left for them, the other half looking for a new way in.  END
BEGIN NOW The two fold attack method was the best plan of action.  END
BEGIN NOW The problem was they weren't counting on a hacker on the other end.  END
BEGIN NOW The didn't know they were up against something more than the usual government drones.  END
BEGIN NOW The counter attacks were getting smarter and that was troublesome.  END
BEGIN NOW But the array of targets was broad enough that they could pick a different point of entry.  END
BEGIN NOW And start over from there.  END
BEGIN NOW The starting over at the roadblocks was hitting morale.  END
BEGIN NOW The attitude at the bunker was getting lower every day.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer was blinded by revenge, by working alone.  END
BEGIN NOW By always being alone.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn't care anymore.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to watch something burn.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to destroy.  END
BEGIN NOW His dreams were bombarded by him finding Cut again.  END
BEGIN NOW By him plugging him with bullets, in just the right places to kill him slowly, giving him enough time for Sawyer to monologue him to death.  END
BEGIN NOW He dreamed of that.  END
BEGIN NOW Watching the look on his old partners face as he explained everything that lead up to the part where he was dying, in a growing pool of his blood.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw himself, smiling, grinning, soaking it all up.  END
BEGIN NOW Not the blood, just the gluttony of absorbing his old partner's shortcoming.  END
BEGIN NOW (that might be a really gay pun.  END
BEGIN NOW Leaving it in there.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe someone will get a chuckle.) Revenge was paramount.  END
BEGIN NOW (another sexual pun? Pair of mount? Maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW Might be a stretch.  END
BEGIN NOW Save the stretches for the yoga puns.  END
BEGIN NOW But that's another story.) END
BEGIN NOW Might be getting ahead of myself in the drinking department.  END
BEGIN NOW I’ve been sleepy all day and now i've been drinking Mom's tequila.  END
BEGIN NOW Mom's rum.  END
BEGIN NOW I know it's mom's because dad would be buying scotch and beer.  END
BEGIN NOW And nothing else.  END
BEGIN NOW My eyes are getting to that point of staring at the screen and wondering why i'm staring at the screen.  END
BEGIN NOW Obviously, my writing's gotten to the point of staring at the screen and just typing words anyway.  END
BEGIN NOW So if I can stare at the screen then I can write things that pass through my head.  END
BEGIN NOW That's all fine and dandy.  END
BEGIN NOW I MIGHT pass out soon.  END
BEGIN NOW I might.  END
BEGIN NOW I don;t know.  END
BEGIN NOW I can't predict the future.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to crank out words until I pass out face first on the keyboard.  END
BEGIN NOW I'd like to do a lot of things.  END
BEGIN NOW But, man.  END
BEGIN NOW Man doesn't that take a lot out of a man.  END
BEGIN NOW So the only answer is to just keep going.  END
BEGIN NOW Just keep plugging away.  END
BEGIN NOW And that's a difficult thing to do.  END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't it matter that I wasn't working from a live copy of whatever i've written before this.  END
BEGIN NOW No.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even.  END
BEGIN NOW Not even a little bit.  END
BEGIN NOW It's all the same.  END
BEGIN NOW I started with a blank page and i'm going to end with a blank page.  END
BEGIN NOW Or at least the idea of a blank page because that's the only thing that could be after the page before it.  END
BEGIN NOW Assuming that the pages never end.  END
BEGIN NOW That's a stupid assumption.  END
BEGIN NOW That must be math theory talking.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't know anything about math theory but i'm fascinated by it.  END
BEGIN NOW From what i've gather from what little I can understand, there's a concept of infinity.  END
BEGIN NOW Within that concept are many other concepts.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of which have a beginning and an end.  END
BEGIN NOW Some dont'.  END
BEGIN NOW But many do.  END
BEGIN NOW But some don't.  END
BEGIN NOW I don't care.  END
BEGIN NOW You can go to hell.  END
BEGIN NOW You can die and go to hell.  END
BEGIN NOW FOUR MORE WORDS DONE. END
BEGIN NOW Ok ok ok.  END
BEGIN NOW let’s check out our situation.  END
BEGIN NOW Last thing i remember writing was Mr. President getting twisted with the aide.  END
BEGIN NOW And Sawyer was working on his vengence.  END
BEGIN NOW I suppose the next thread is our attack party in Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW They need to take some retaliation action.  END
BEGIN NOW Something scary and with in reach.  END
BEGIN NOW Something we can all be afraid of.  END
BEGIN NOW That would be good.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re pretty much a nameless and faceless group of people.  END
BEGIN NOW With the damages they could do… hmm END
BEGIN NOW What would a group of political for profit group do for revenge.  END
BEGIN NOW the banks maybe? dox some people.  END
BEGIN NOW I don’t know. END
BEGIN NOW We think of the cloud as a kind of ethereal concept where data lives.  END
BEGIN NOW The reality of the cloud is more like a large room full of rack mount servers.  END
BEGIN NOW Picture a cage like locker room with climate controls and lots of blinking LEDs.  END
BEGIN NOW Wires criss-crossing each other in zip tied clusters, each one with a label.  END
BEGIN NOW The room is always under lock and key with cameras point at every entrance and exit.  END
BEGIN NOW We like to think of the cloud as a giant hard drive that floats in the aether.  END
BEGIN NOW We like to think that everything that goes into the cloud is safe and untouchable.  END
BEGIN NOW This of course isn’t true at all.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a thousand ways in.  END
BEGIN NOW Most of them are walking around with name tags.  END
BEGIN NOW The weakest link is and always will be other people.  END
BEGIN NOW And the easiest way to utilize them is to exploit their curiosity and their trust.  END
BEGIN NOW This can be accomplished in a manner of different ways.  END
BEGIN NOW I think we covered phishing and spear phishing earlier, so we’re going to take a different approach this time. END
BEGIN NOW Our friends in Romania have some splinter groups or factions or friends.  END
BEGIN NOW People all around the world near various facilities, waiting for orders.  END
BEGIN NOW One foot solider is given marching orders for a data center in Maryland.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s going to try a tried and true method of breaking into the place without setting foot in the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He goes to his local office supply store and buys a box of low capacity USB keys.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the process is a little meticulous if he hadn’t written scripts to accomplish it.  END
BEGIN NOW He reformats all the keys and adds some code to the partition that is fired up whenever the key is inserted into a machine.  END
BEGIN NOW He has that code check for the make and model of the machine, what kind of operating system is running, then it will trigger another script.  END
BEGIN NOW The second script will find a process is each type of common computer on the market and latch onto it.  END
BEGIN NOW It will create a backdoor that calls back to his computer at home and the group in Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW It won’t have low level privilege, but it will be an in.  END
BEGIN NOW It’ll be a start.  END
BEGIN NOW From there, they can escalate and infiltrate. END
BEGIN NOW Our guy on the ground takes handfuls of these USB keys and leaves them in the parking lot.  END
BEGIN NOW He tails a few employees on lunch break to see where they go.  END
BEGIN NOW He leaves a key or two near their car.  END
BEGIN NOW Making it look like they must have dropped it.  END
BEGIN NOW He peppers every place he thinks someone that works at the data center might look.  END
BEGIN NOW Once he gets a hit, he has his home system pick up the connection and automatically work from there.  END
BEGIN NOW For every hit he gets, a message pops up on his phone with the address of the compromised system and any information his scripts have gathered so far.  END
BEGIN NOW If something really good comes up, he rushes home and takes over the autopilot.  END
BEGIN NOW He keeps track for his own records and logs and to make sure his employers across the sea get what they pay for.  END
BEGIN NOW He’s very good at his job.  END
BEGIN NOW The lost USB key method has a 75% chance of success.  END
BEGIN NOW Variations of this method include going up to the front desk and saying you found this outside and it probably belongs to someone.  END
BEGIN NOW Or handing out CDs on the street.  END
BEGIN NOW Or sending it via the post with a priority envelope and a return address that makes it seem like official business.  END
BEGIN NOW Even if a person doesn’t recognize the device, more often than not, they want to know what’s on the disk.  END
BEGIN NOW To minimize the failure rate, our guy has coded some juicy looking stuff to pop up and distract who ever was curious.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it’s some amatur pornography, sometimes it’s leaked company documents.  END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it’s a game, or some music.  END
BEGIN NOW He tries to play it by ear, depending on who the target is.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of you might be thinking, i’ve got an anti-virus set up that will detect these types of trojans.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m totally safe and secure.  END
BEGIN NOW Well, I’m sorry, but no.  END
BEGIN NOW The code for the payload is what your antivirus is looking for.  END
BEGIN NOW Usually a very specific few lines of code, like scanning for a signature.  END
BEGIN NOW The clever attacker has a piece of software on his side that will run that signiture through a kind of sausage grinder, usually multiple times, making it look nothing like the original.  END
BEGIN NOW The anti-virus has no idea what it’s looking and at and passes it along, thinking that everything is going just fine.  END
BEGIN NOW The effort it takes to do this is minimal.  END
BEGIN NOW The time it takes is fifteen minutes or less. END
BEGIN NOW The man sat in his car, sipping his coffee, phone on his lap, waiting for the dings to start.  END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally, he’ look out the window and see what was going on around him.  END
BEGIN NOW Mostly he just looked at his phone, waiting for something.  END
BEGIN NOW A call to action.  END
BEGIN NOW It was two hours later that the alarms started going off.  END
BEGIN NOW He started his car and drove back to the hotel room he was renting.  END
BEGIN NOW After checking the progress of his scripts he had accumulated five separate points of entry.  END
BEGIN NOW Within an hour he had administrator privileges on all of.  END
BEGIN NOW He forwarded all of that information to Romania and continued probing.  END
BEGIN NOW A major cloud service provider, with several government contracts and links to another large telecom company had their guts laid out in front of him.  END
BEGIN NOW He dumps the database, giving him several thousand usernames and passwords, some encrypted, some in clear text.  END
BEGIN NOW He sets up backdoors on each account and sets up an alert should anything be compromised. END
BEGIN NOW Letting his machines run through a standard decrypting process, he takes a break, pops a few morphine pills and rolls a cigarette laced with cocaine.  END
BEGIN NOW He stands on his balcony, in his underclothes, smoking slow and letting the chemicals massage his brain and body.  END
BEGIN NOW All in a day’s work.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d spend the next several hours waiting for the ding that let him know the money was transferred.  END
BEGIN NOW Then treat himself to a steak dinner and the company of a women for a few hours.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a living.  END
BEGIN NOW It was good enough for him. END
BEGIN NOW In the basement of a nondescript building, Sawyer is plugging away in front of his desk in his solitary confine, under tight surveillance.  END
BEGIN NOW He does several probes on his old friend.  END
BEGIN NOW He finds everything he can find.  END
BEGIN NOW His real name, his current addresses.  END
BEGIN NOW Any phone numbers attached to him.  END
BEGIN NOW Business contacts, lovers, family members, vehicle registration.  END
BEGIN NOW He keeps all that information set aside, waiting for his project to reach completion.  END
BEGIN NOW The main piece of coding is reaching the end.  END
BEGIN NOW He just has a few more bugs to work out. END
BEGIN NOW On November 2nd, 1988 the world of computer security changed forever.  END
BEGIN NOW You might even say that the idea of needing computer security really started on that day.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the public awareness of how vulnerable this project, later known as the internet, really was.  END
BEGIN NOW A few days before his 23rd birthday, a student near MIT released a project he’d been working on that was going to try to map every connected UNIX machine in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW He knew of a few vulnerabilities in the sendmail program that was standard, along with a handful of other services and a bunch of default passwords.  END
BEGIN NOW The program would jump from machine to machine, replicating and looking for every host the computer was connected to.  END
BEGIN NOW It was supposed to harmlessly travel and catalog every host that it found.  END
BEGIN NOW Due to a small programming error, it reproduced out of control, crippling every machine it came into contact with.  END
BEGIN NOW Within a few hours 20,000 computers were infected.  END
BEGIN NOW this was the first instance of what became known as the Morris Worm.  END
BEGIN NOW The fallout took days to recover, with teams working around the clock to isolate and remove the worm.  END
BEGIN NOW Normal maintenance wouldn’t work, the worm just crawled back in.  END
BEGIN NOW For more information, see Clifford Stoll’s fantastic book, The Cuckoo’s Nest (1989). END
BEGIN NOW The real damage from the Morris Worm, as is the case with many new and fascinating crimes, are the copy cats.  END
BEGIN NOW With a good programmer, all you really need is the idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Figuring out how to execute the idea is half the fun.  END
BEGIN NOW Debugging isn’t as much, but the thrill of working on something for months and seeing a successful run through is a very unique kind of rush.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea of coding multiple viruses together, making it replicate and spread, and it some cases, adapt to various circumstances, has a wide appeal.  END
BEGIN NOW All you need is the idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer’s idea was grand in scale.  END
BEGIN NOW It was all at once, elegant, sinister, devastating, and beautiful.  END
BEGIN NOW He had all the time in the world, chasing cyber criminals around the world.  END
BEGIN NOW His captors were never specific about when his debt to society would be paid, and in truth, viewed him more as too dangerous to be released back into the wild.  END
BEGIN NOW If that ever did happen, he was sure they’d be watching his every move, waiting to catch him in the act again.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to continue his indentured servitude. END
BEGIN NOW Time in the basement passed in unknown amounts.  END
BEGIN NOW He hadn’t seen sunlight since his incarceration.  END
BEGIN NOW He slept when he was tired, they fed him by sending a tray through the slot in the door.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t talk to anyone, he didn’t listen to music.  END
BEGIN NOW His whole world was in code.  END
BEGIN NOW Day after day he would sit and type and test run.  END
BEGIN NOW He would send his captures enough info to fill their quotas for caught criminals.  END
BEGIN NOW The majority of this time was focused on getting his worm ready for launch day. END
BEGIN NOW The first direct action taken by the Romanians came on a grey, autumn morning, in the form of a data dump, what the industry refers to a doxing.  END
BEGIN NOW Thousands of names, private emails, home addresses, job titles, hundreds of inter-office memos from every agency in the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW All of it leaked to the internet for all to see.  END
BEGIN NOW Undercover cops, secret agents, clandestine operations, racist private messages, evidence of fraud, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit murder, proof of murders, drone strikes.  END
BEGIN NOW All the dirty laundry they could find, airing out for all the world to see.  END
BEGIN NOW All the numbers needed for to lock away some very high level officials.  END
BEGIN NOW The world went into a tailspin.  END
BEGIN NOW The U.N.  END
BEGIN NOW was locked in session for several days.  END
BEGIN NOW Washington D.C.  END
BEGIN NOW was in full panic.  END
BEGIN NOW The streets were clogged with riots and protests, with S.W.A.T.  END
BEGIN NOW and cops and Military, some still loyal, some questioning what exactly, they had signed up for.  END
BEGIN NOW The anger and outrage swept from state to state, coast to coast, around the world.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President had been taken to his bunker far below the east wing of the White House.  END
BEGIN NOW The phones were jammed with people yelling, screaming, in tears.  END
BEGIN NOW Outside the people raged for justice.  END
BEGIN NOW The tension that had been mounting for years, the conspiracy theories, the anger of the every citizen living under the poverty line, everything came crashing to a head. END
BEGIN NOW The second act from Romania came a few days later, while the world was reeling in confusion and chaos.  END
BEGIN NOW One by one, systems began to fail.  END
BEGIN NOW The data farms for the NSA, the CIA, and FBI started to overload.  END
BEGIN NOW Every automated system that was there to monitor national security was flooding with more information than it was capable of processes.  END
BEGIN NOW Under normal circumstances, we’d call this a distributed denial of service attack.  END
BEGIN NOW Under normal circumstances, this is done to a server or series of servers by requesting large amounts of information rapidly.  END
BEGIN NOW Under normal circumstances, the server will go offline, or try to block the source of the requests, or just shut down until someone comes along to fix the problem.  END
BEGIN NOW This was not a normal set of circumstances.  END
BEGIN NOW While the whistleblowers of the world were busy combing through the first data dump, the Romanians were using that information to cripple the system from the inside.  END
BEGIN NOW Many of the monitoring systems in place operated on sets of keywords that would trigger more extensive action.  END
BEGIN NOW If you use your phone or email, or probably this whole manuscript i’ve been working on.  END
BEGIN NOW Any communication medium.  END
BEGIN NOW And you use words like, ‘bomb’ or ‘assassination’ or any one of hundreds of words that would catch the attention of someone looking to protect the national interests, as soon as you use one or more of those words the system will start logging your activities, depending on what it finds, you’ll move up or down a scale of how intense the logging will be, depending on the severity of what they find.  END
BEGIN NOW The old idea that there’s someone reading your email is less accurate.  END
BEGIN NOW A machine is.  END
BEGIN NOW and if that machine finds something scary, it will report it further up the chain.  END
BEGIN NOW If evidence is found to support cause of action, that’s usually when warrants are issued, or they just break down your door and take you away in the middle of the night.  END
BEGIN NOW If you’ve followed the news for the last fifteen years, this shouldn’t be surprising to you. END
BEGIN NOW The flaw in that system that no one was expecting anyone to be brazen enough to overload the system.  END
BEGIN NOW The most advanced system in the world, with more capacity than any data system ever seen.  END
BEGIN NOW No one would dare send an army of flag waving right to the front door.  END
BEGIN NOW The genius move, the icing on the cake was inspired by what has become a horror movie cliche. END
BEGIN NOW Think of the NSA as a babysitter, watching over little baby America in her crib upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW She tucks America in bed, sings it a little lullaby called “Everything is fine, go to sleep” and goes downstairs to watch some tv until Mom and Dad get home.  END
BEGIN NOW She has the baby monitor on.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the phone rings.  END
BEGIN NOW On the other end of the line is a slimy voice, it only asks a question before hanging up.  END
BEGIN NOW “Have you checked the kid lately?” and it hangs up.  END
BEGIN NOW The babysitter runs upstairs and everything looks normal.  END
BEGIN NOW America is sound asleep.  END
BEGIN NOW Shaken, but more annoyed than anything, the babysitter goes back to watching TV.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the phone rings again.  END
BEGIN NOW Same story, slimy voiced creep asks about the kid.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again, she runs upstairs, freaking out.  END
BEGIN NOW Once again, everything is quiet upstairs.  END
BEGIN NOW Wanting to put an end to this nonsense, the babysitter calls the police, asking them to trace a call.  END
BEGIN NOW She says someone has been harassing her all night.  END
BEGIN NOW The police person on the other end of the line asks her if this is a joke and exasperatedly, she says no, some creep has been calling her all night.  END
BEGIN NOW Then the background music which has been building to a crescendo in the background suddenly stops and the cop says, “The call is coming from inside the house.” Then everyone screams and she runs upstairs and the kid is gone and she has to deal with a maniac trying to stab her in a kind of morbid version of Home Alone. END
BEGIN NOW The Romanians managed to infiltrate the very system put in place to monitor all the communications and have them call each other, over and over again, repeating the list of keywords to each other.  END
BEGIN NOW The engineers working to fix the problem found themselves locked out of their own system.  END
BEGIN NOW Every failsafe they had put in place was turning on them.  END
BEGIN NOW The plug was never designed to be pulled.  END
BEGIN NOW No one ever had ever thought they would have to turn it off.  END
BEGIN NOW Cleaning this mess up would take weeks.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe even months.  END
BEGIN NOW In the meantime, the general public was free to go about it’s business for the first time in decades, without the watchful babysitter’s prying eyes.  END
BEGIN NOW “You wanna go loot some stuff?” END
BEGIN NOW “Nah, I don’t need any more things.” The guy kicked a can.  END
BEGIN NOW In the background there were buildings on fire.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of them were even political buildings.  END
BEGIN NOW All up and down the street people ran, yelling, breaking windows, and lighting things on fire. END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t know when we got to the point as a species when this was our first reaction to corruption.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m mean sure, i get the whole, the cat’s away thing.  END
BEGIN NOW But seriously.  END
BEGIN NOW I think most people would just want to keep going with their lives.” END
BEGIN NOW “Hey, a lot of people are really mad.” The other guy takes a drink from his can of beer.  END
BEGIN NOW “You can’t blame them a helluva lot.” END
BEGIN NOW “The hell i can’t.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s lots of people to blame, and people are certainly to blame for this mess.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, i guess you’re right about that.” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m just wondering when people are going to get back to work.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a lot left to be done.” END
BEGIN NOW “You think they’re going to rebuild the government, or what?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, i’m sure they will.  END
BEGIN NOW Somehow, some way, they always find a means to put it back together the same.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe worse.  END
BEGIN NOW The ones at the top aren’t stupid.  END
BEGIN NOW Least, not as stupid as we want to think they are.  END
BEGIN NOW They’re just mad they got caught.” END
BEGIN NOW “Well, the national guard is having trouble keeping people on board.  END
BEGIN NOW Those guys aren’t none too happy about all of it either.” END
BEGIN NOW “True, true.  END
BEGIN NOW Either way, it’s only a matter of time before they find some people that just want to get paid to wave guns around and corral the dissenters.” END
BEGIN NOW “Gonna be fuckin’ animal farm around here.” END
BEGIN NOW “IT’s been animal farm.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s going to be more like the old soviet union.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s what animal farm was about, sort of.” END
BEGIN NOW “oh, yeah.  END
BEGIN NOW there’s that too.” END
BEGIN NOW The two guys sit around drinking beers they took from the corner store.  END
BEGIN NOW there wasn’t much left.  END
BEGIN NOW The shopkeeper was long gone.  END
BEGIN NOW Most people went to the banks to try and get their savings accounts out.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people went to the banks to rob the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Some people went to the stores and stockpiled food and water for the end of the world, which is what it was looking like. END
BEGIN NOW “People want to hoot and holler about this and that.  END
BEGIN NOW it’s all the same.  END
BEGIN NOW ain’t nothin’ gonna change.  END
BEGIN NOW any one in control is going to go down the same ol’ path.  END
BEGIN NOW And what are we gonna do about it? fuckin’ nothin’.” END
BEGIN NOW “I hear they’re calling in the army from around the world.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, they would do that when the cops were proving ineffective.  END
BEGIN NOW police state is nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW we’re going to be under martial law in a minute.” END
BEGIN NOW “Damn shame.  END
BEGIN NOW I was just starting to feel at home” END
BEGIN NOW “That a fact? i was never too comfortable here.  END
BEGIN NOW Something was always kinda off.” END
BEGIN NOW “maybe that was something i could count on.  END
BEGIN NOW Always could count on things being a bit off.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, you may be right.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you are.” They both paused and took sips of beer and watched the flames of city hall reach far into the sky. END
BEGIN NOW “lot of innocent people gonna get caught up in these fires.” END
BEGIN NOW “mhmm.  END
BEGIN NOW just wait till they start lynching people.” END
BEGIN NOW “You think it’ll come to that?” END
BEGIN NOW “I’m sure it already has in places.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re just a bunch of scared, dumb animals.  END
BEGIN NOW We still know it’s kill or be killed.” END
BEGIN NOW “You sure gotta bleak outlook on life.” END
BEGIN NOW “I don’t think of it like that.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m just not surprised when people do these terrible things.” END
BEGIN NOW “We shouldn’t think of it as normal.  END
BEGIN NOW We have so much potential.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, maybe.  END
BEGIN NOW We have a potential to do dumb shit when we’re scared, that much i do know.” END
BEGIN NOW “You want to get a sandwich?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, why not.” END
BEGIN NOW The two guys get up and walk down the street.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s broken glass from shop windows that have been busted out all over the place.  END
BEGIN NOW Smoke spills out of some of them.  END
BEGIN NOW Different vehicles from SWAT to sedans are parked in the middle of the street.  END
BEGIN NOW There’s a truck half way in the front window of the certified public accountant.  END
BEGIN NOW Down the road a little ways in the sandwich shop they’d been going to all week.  END
BEGIN NOW The place was a mess.  END
BEGIN NOW debris all over the floor.  END
BEGIN NOW thankfully the electricity was still on.  END
BEGIN NOW A regular miracle during the past week.  END
BEGIN NOW The guys walk into the back kitchen and start going through the refrigerators.  END
BEGIN NOW They pull out some ham and tomatoes and cheese.  END
BEGIN NOW They find a bag of rolls that isn’t moldy or stale, another small miracle. END
BEGIN NOW “Oh hey, look at this!” one of the guys calls from a storage closet. END
BEGIN NOW “What is it? i’m busy with the mustard.” he applies a thick coat of mustard dismissively. END
BEGIN NOW “We got some refreshments! and quality ones at that.” He walks into the room with a twenty four count case of beer in the bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW “Still cold on account of no insulation in here any more. END
BEGIN NOW “Well la di da.” He allows himself a smile.  END
BEGIN NOW They pop open some fresh beers and eat their sandwiches in the back room.  END
BEGIN NOW No sense of attracting attention to their little lunch spot.  END
BEGIN NOW This wasn’t a good time to be attracting attention. END
BEGIN NOW “You know, back in my youth, i was always waiting for this day to come.  END
BEGIN NOW You know, after reading the news all the time and being at school and everyone was so mad about the wars.  END
BEGIN NOW Seemed like any day the bubble would burst and the fires of revolution would burn and the great ninety nine percent would concur all. END
BEGIN NOW “No one had the guts.  END
BEGIN NOW And anyone that talked that extreme was labeled a terrorist and never heard from again.” END
BEGIN NOW “Exactly.  END
BEGIN NOW But now that it’s happening, i don’t know.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s just not what i was expecting.” END
BEGIN NOW “revolution is never a clean thing.  END
BEGIN NOW People always have to die.  END
BEGIN NOW Fires always have to burn.  END
BEGIN NOW Heads will roll, as the French said.” END
BEGIN NOW “Let’s put some of these beers in the cooler.” END
BEGIN NOW “Alright.” END
BEGIN NOW They finished their sandwiches and drank their beers.  END
BEGIN NOW They spent a lot of their time in silence.  END
BEGIN NOW Just listening to chaos that was happening outside.  END
BEGIN NOW Occasionally, people would march past the shop, shouting in unison, something about burning the rich and the only good politician is a dead politician.  END
BEGIN NOW In the first few days they’d hear sirens not far behind.  END
BEGIN NOW Now, they heard gunshots, but they were happening with less frequency. END
BEGIN NOW “pretty soon, they’re going to run out of places to burn and people to kill.  END
BEGIN NOW Or what’s left of the military is going to come in and rain hell on the lot of them.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, I imagine so.” END
BEGIN NOW “at least we got this old place to ourselves for the time being.” END
BEGIN NOW “For the time being.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’s all we can really ask for.” END
BEGIN NOW The sun set on the town and a few undamaged street lights managed to flicker to life.  END
BEGIN NOW The fires were starting to die down and the marching protesters were losing steam.  END
BEGIN NOW None of them were thinking about rebuilding.  END
BEGIN NOW No one really knew what to do when the anger turned into a tired whimper.  END
BEGIN NOW The people that still had homes shuffled off to get some rest.  END
BEGIN NOW See if there was any news.  END
BEGIN NOW Somehow, most of the infrastructure was still operational.  END
BEGIN NOW The phone lines mostly worked.  END
BEGIN NOW The power hadn’t gone out everywhere yet.  END
BEGIN NOW The water was running.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside from that, you could mostly forget about it.  END
BEGIN NOW Schools were out until further notice, most kids that didn’t get locked up at home had joined the rally, demanding the blood of the mayor, the president, the senate.  END
BEGIN NOW At this point, the people didn’t know or care if anyone in a position of power was innocent or not.  END
BEGIN NOW They all had to go.  END
BEGIN NOW jail wasn’t really an option.  END
BEGIN NOW Reformation wasn’t going to be enough.  END
BEGIN NOW Community service would have been too kind.  END
BEGIN NOW It had to be public, it had to be bloody. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in his basement prison cell, Sawyer knew something was very wrong when the food stopped coming.  END
BEGIN NOW The power flickered every now and again, another cause for concern.  END
BEGIN NOW He figured, after three days, that it was now or never. END
BEGIN NOW Phase one of the worm would take out all the surveillance in the building and anything attached to the same network.  END
BEGIN NOW It was not the sneaky kind of taking out the surveillance popular in movies and television where the crafty thieves loop footage on all the cameras so that no one suspects a thing.  END
BEGIN NOW This worm just knocked it right out.  END
BEGIN NOW erased everything.  END
BEGIN NOW The footage, the software, the firmware, the drivers. END
BEGIN NOW Phase two would disable all door locks, all security systems, and clog the phone systems.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t have a radio jammer, so taking out any communications beyond the phone lines was impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW He would have to make due.  END
BEGIN NOW That should be enough to get him out of the building. END
BEGIN NOW Phase three was coded to get into the outside world.  END
BEGIN NOW Phase three had the goal of ruining his old partner, Carter.  END
BEGIN NOW The worm would shift Carter’s finances to some shady and illegal operations.  END
BEGIN NOW Lots of drug money on the dark web, frame him in with some cartels, make it international.  END
BEGIN NOW After the money looked like it was going to some criminal places he would leak the story to every news outlet, every blog, twitter feed.  END
BEGIN NOW Carter’s reputation would be shot in the course of several minutes.  END
BEGIN NOW The worm would make it look like a classic slip up.  END
BEGIN NOW Letting some personal data go unencrypted on the dark web on an exit node that was owned by the cops.  END
BEGIN NOW He was pretty sure that the feds were already watching Carter very closely.  END
BEGIN NOW He was sure that they’d be at his door soon and having him in a nicely wrapped package of evidence land on their digital doorstep would only help them out.  END
BEGIN NOW Sure, it would look like a classic betrayal situation, but the feds didn’t care.  END
BEGIN NOW It was more leverage. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer clicked return and counted.  END
BEGIN NOW He estimated that it would take thirty seconds before the doors open.  END
BEGIN NOW He started counting in his head and thinking about his exit strategy.  END
BEGIN NOW Part of his siphoning of Carter’s money went to purchase himself a new identity which would land in an old P.O.  END
BEGIN NOW Box of his.  END
BEGIN NOW Another chunk would be deposited into a checking account that would then get routed to an overseas bank.  END
BEGIN NOW He would then close that account out and have the money transferred to him in cash.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a little fuzzy on the details of getting that cash, but wanted the money to pass through several channels before he got to it.  END
BEGIN NOW Just covering his tracks.  END
BEGIN NOW He needed a phone, and he needed an internet connection.  END
BEGIN NOW He needed to get somewhere safe as soon as possible.  END
BEGIN NOW He really needed something to eat. END
BEGIN NOW The doors clicked open.  END
BEGIN NOW He had counted to one hundred.  END
BEGIN NOW Something was slowing the system down.  END
BEGIN NOW He stepped out of his cell and looked around.  END
BEGIN NOW There was no one there.  END
BEGIN NOW No guards, nothing.  END
BEGIN NOW it was very quiet.  END
BEGIN NOW In the other cells, people stirred to wakefulness.  END
BEGIN NOW the exhaustion of having not eaten for a few days led to many of them trying to sleep until some food came up.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer wasted no time.  END
BEGIN NOW They’d have to figure it out for themselves.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a staircase at the end of the hall and run up two steps at a time.  END
BEGIN NOW He flung open the door to the next floor up and it was the same story, empty hall.  END
BEGIN NOW no guards.  END
BEGIN NOW A few confused prisoners walking around.  END
BEGIN NOW He went back to the stairwell and ran up another flight.  END
BEGIN NOW He did the same thing for three more stories.  END
BEGIN NOW He opened the next door and the hallway was different.  END
BEGIN NOW There were cubicles with no one in them.  END
BEGIN NOW His worm had clogged all the computers here, every screen was a buzz with activity.  END
BEGIN NOW Windows opening and closing, text being typed by ghosts, everything flying around at superhuman speed.  END
BEGIN NOW He rummaged around the desks for anything he could use, he found some keys and a flashlight.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t know the time of day, that might come in handy.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a pack of gum and greedily chewed a piece.  END
BEGIN NOW The rush of flavor in his mouth was overwhelming.  END
BEGIN NOW It knocked some sense into him.  END
BEGIN NOW Where was everyone? had they gone home for the day? shouldn’t they at least have left someone to keep an eye on things? He was a dangerous criminal.  END
BEGIN NOW He was a menace to society.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt a little insulted. END
BEGIN NOW He tore down the hallway, looking for anything he could use.  END
BEGIN NOW If only he knew what happened to his back pack.  END
BEGIN NOW Where would you keep things taken from the prisoners? He had no idea.  END
BEGIN NOW Was there a map of this building? a fire escape plan would be really nice right about now.  END
BEGIN NOW It was a government operation, i’m sure there was some regulations about that kind of thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Even in tech prison.  END
BEGIN NOW He made it to the end of the floor and didn’t find a damn thing.  END
BEGIN NOW Up the stairs again.  END
BEGIN NOW He stopped to catch his breath.  END
BEGIN NOW All this time underground, sitting at a desk, sleeping whenever.  END
BEGIN NOW He was more out of shape than usual.  END
BEGIN NOW He opened the next door.  END
BEGIN NOW More cubicles.  END
BEGIN NOW Maybe something here he could use.  END
BEGIN NOW He rummaged around, now feeling alone and a little more safe.  END
BEGIN NOW Also concerned.  END
BEGIN NOW There should be SOMEONE here.  END
BEGIN NOW aside from the prisoners, of course.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a staff break room and the fridge was still running.  END
BEGIN NOW He found some questionable items, but there was a cup of yogurt and a banana.  END
BEGIN NOW Brain food, probably for the best to have something soft for his first meal in three days.  END
BEGIN NOW He inhaled everything quickly and went back to looking for something to help, looking for an exit.  END
BEGIN NOW At the other end of the room, he found a goldmine.  END
BEGIN NOW Someone left a laptop sitting on their desk.  END
BEGIN NOW That was the best thing he could have hoped for.  END
BEGIN NOW Now he just needed to get out.  END
BEGIN NOW He found the escape plan.  END
BEGIN NOW Two more floors to climb.  END
BEGIN NOW He was going to loot the place, but in a hurry.  END
BEGIN NOW It was only a matter of time before someone would come along and wonder what the hell he was doing.  END
BEGIN NOW he was going to bet that the person that would find him would be armed.  END
BEGIN NOW He didn’t want to wait around for him.  END
BEGIN NOW On the next floor he found a shopping bag, that would help with carrying the laptop.  END
BEGIN NOW He had some strength coming back to him and leaped up the stairs to what the map said was the exit.  END
BEGIN NOW He hurried his way past the front desk, his brain so focused on the exit that he only noticed the broken glass in passing.  END
BEGIN NOW He was too focused on getting out.  END
BEGIN NOW He saw the front door and ran. END
BEGIN NOW He pushed through the door and all around him ashes rained down.  END
BEGIN NOW The world was grey.  END
BEGIN NOW He smelled burning.  END
BEGIN NOW The kind of burning smell that indicated that things were on fire that shouldn’t be.  END
BEGIN NOW Objects never meant to burn.  END
BEGIN NOW He blinked in the mix of daylight and ashen overcast.  END
BEGIN NOW What the hell had happened? What new hell was this? END
BEGIN NOW Getting closer to the end and made the mistake of going to a coffee shop.  END
BEGIN NOW So many people.  END
BEGIN NOW So many distractions.  END
BEGIN NOW The buzz and hum of many conversations turns into a kind of static in the background.  END
BEGIN NOW White noise from white people.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m coming up on the final countdown.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s the last day for this project.  END
BEGIN NOW I have about 2400 words to wrap this story up.  END
BEGIN NOW Might as well get to it.  END
BEGIN NOW save the rant for the end. END
BEGIN NOW “MR. PRESIDENT!” END
BEGIN NOW The most powerful man in the world was asleep on his sleeve, his suit wrinkled and his face wrinkled and his spirit soaked in spirits.  END
BEGIN NOW He roused from his substance induced slumber and cracked a bloodshot eye at the aide that entered his chambers deep underground below the white house.  END
BEGIN NOW HIs private bunker built during the second world war, strong enough to withstand a nuclear blast.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt safe, if not stressed out.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt helpless and angry.  END
BEGIN NOW If only they’d taken his military advisors suggestion and bombed the shit out of Romania.  END
BEGIN NOW If only he could go back in time and stop this mess before it started.  END
BEGIN NOW This was no time to live in regrets. END
BEGIN NOW “What was your name again?” END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, right.  END
BEGIN NOW what’s the latest from the surface?” END
BEGIN NOW “The people are still rioting, sir.  END
BEGIN NOW The streets are clogged with dissent and they want to hear from you.  END
BEGIN NOW I suspect they want your head.” END
BEGIN NOW “That’s great.  END
BEGIN NOW Great news.” The president looked around his desk for something to drink.  END
BEGIN NOW A bottle of painkillers, some stimulants to balance out the opiates.  END
BEGIN NOW Anything to kick his brain into working for a little while longer.  END
BEGIN NOW His hairs were greying rapidly.  END
BEGIN NOW He had aged more in the last few days than most presidents do during their whole term.  END
BEGIN NOW He was, over all things, a very tired man. END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, do we have anything left to drink is this hell hole?” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, sir.” Thompson exited the room and returned with a jug of ice water and a decanter of brown liquid. END
BEGIN NOW “That’s spirit.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s why i wanted you here.  END
BEGIN NOW No messing around.  END
BEGIN NOW You’re a good man, Thompson.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thank you, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “glasses!” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW The president poured them both three fingers of the brown liquor. END
BEGIN NOW “Cheers,” Mr. President said, “To the end of the civilized world.” He downed the whole glass and filled it again.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson took a liberal gulp and eyed the president wearily. END
BEGIN NOW “How goes progress with operation payback?” END
BEGIN NOW “The strike was ordered to execute at 2200 hours.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re awaiting confirmation of destruction, sir.” END
BEGIN NOW “Excellent, that’s great news.” END
BEGIN NOW High in the skies of Romania a small fleet of jet fighters equipped with bunker buster bombs are flying out of radar range. END
BEGIN NOW “Angel of Mercy, this is Angel of Death, over.” END
BEGIN NOW “Roger, Angel of Death target is approaching, ready when you are.” END
BEGIN NOW “Ready and willing, Angel of Mercy, commencing deployment.  END
BEGIN NOW on my count, fire.” END
BEGIN NOW Three thumbs flick open the panel revealing little red buttons. END
BEGIN NOW “3.  END
BEGIN NOW 2.  END
BEGIN NOW 1.  END
BEGIN NOW Fire!” END
BEGIN NOW Three thumbs press down and six units fall from the wings.  END
BEGIN NOW The bombs point straight down.  END
BEGIN NOW The bunker buster is a bomb designed to penetrate concrete up to several meters before detonating.  END
BEGIN NOW On the ground the first bomb hits and in the bunker a dozen faces look at each other before an explosion rips through the room, sending fire and flaming debris in all directions.  END
BEGIN NOW Vaporizing flesh and electronics with equal prejudice. END
BEGIN NOW “Angel of Mercy, do you copy?” END
BEGIN NOW “We copy Angel of Death, target destroyed, return to base.” END
BEGIN NOW “Roger that.” END
BEGIN NOW Another diplomatic mission accomplished.  END
BEGIN NOW A little too little, too late. END
BEGIN NOW 1900 words to go, you can do this. END
BEGIN NOW The world was plunged into a kind of chaos unknown for generations.  END
BEGIN NOW it was a wonder that some people felt compelled to try to keep things running.  END
BEGIN NOW The mail was one of those things.  END
BEGIN NOW Nor rain nor snow nor sleet nor hail nor revolution nor eroded faith in the powers that be.  END
BEGIN NOW The military had been called in to restore order while the president hid away in his bunker, engaged in his own war with his liver.  END
BEGIN NOW His wife and children were being kept away from him.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson was the only person he allowed into his office.  END
BEGIN NOW Even then it was only to drink, mostly in silence.  END
BEGIN NOW He would ask on occasion about the situation on the surface.  END
BEGIN NOW The news was never what he wanted to hear.  END
BEGIN NOW He almost missed the old meetings they used to have.  END
BEGIN NOW The sour looks of his diplomatic advisor.  END
BEGIN NOW The constant aggression of his military man.  END
BEGIN NOW The table with all the spooks and yes men and double agents.  END
BEGIN NOW He missed the good old days.  END
BEGIN NOW And he drank, waiting for the storm to pass and some semblance of order to be restored. END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer had managed to loot a few tools.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a working cell phone.  END
BEGIN NOW He found a place that hadn’t been fire bombed by the angry public, enough for him to plug in and see how far his revenge worm had gotten.  END
BEGIN NOW Not far enough after the banks collapsed.  END
BEGIN NOW Not as far as he was hoping.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked everywhere for signs that his old friend was active somewhere, but was coming up empty.  END
BEGIN NOW Figures.  END
BEGIN NOW He no doubt had a backup plan in case of this kind of scenario.  END
BEGIN NOW His prison contacts probably helped him a great deal.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer found a place to camp out near his old P.O.  END
BEGIN NOW Box, in hopes that his new identity would arrive and his money would follow.  END
BEGIN NOW He managed to get back on the net by piggy backing on his cell signal.  END
BEGIN NOW The people that ran the networks knew that above all, the network needed to stay online.  END
BEGIN NOW If we lost that, we’d lose everything.  END
BEGIN NOW All hope would be lost.  END
BEGIN NOW All communication would be next to impossible.  END
BEGIN NOW Aside from radio.  END
BEGIN NOW The radio stations were some of the last remaining sources of news.  END
BEGIN NOW That and a handful of blogs, likely ran from bunkers and cabins far away from the chaos of the cities.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer watched and waited.  END
BEGIN NOW He would leave on occasion to scrounge for food.  END
BEGIN NOW His supplies were getting lower and lower.  END
BEGIN NOW At least the water was still running. END
BEGIN NOW He found himself in front of a mostly intact sandwich shop and decided to take a look inside.  END
BEGIN NOW He heard voices coming from the back and proceeded with caution.  END
BEGIN NOW He’d run into a few other people, they mostly reacted violently with fear, running and avoiding confrontation. END
BEGIN NOW “I heard they’re building camps again.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yeah, it was only a matter of time.” The voices were coming from the back room.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer poked his head around the corner to try and get a good look at the people behind the sounds. END
BEGIN NOW “OH looky! we got a live one!” one of the voices hollered at Sawyer. END
BEGIN NOW “Shit!” Sawyer said, scrambling to his feet, fight or flight telling him to get the hell out of there. END
BEGIN NOW “No need to run, boy.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re not interested in hurting or robbing you.” One of the guys said, putting down his beer bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW The other one was laughing, but trying not to be rude about it.  END
BEGIN NOW “We won’t bite, come over here.  END
BEGIN NOW have a beer, they’re still cold.” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer walked over with caution, keeping his guard up.  END
BEGIN NOW His world was lies and deception.  END
BEGIN NOW trust was a vulnerability waiting to be exploited. END
BEGIN NOW “there, there.  END
BEGIN NOW nothin’ to be scared of.  END
BEGIN NOW we’re just looking to relax, not get shot.  END
BEGIN NOW you ain’t planning on shooting up our little hideaway are ya?” END
BEGIN NOW “Don’t have a gun.  END
BEGIN NOW Not really my thing.” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh good, here, have a beer.” The guy offered him an open bottle. END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks.” He said, taking a long drink. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey there, manners, manners.  END
BEGIN NOW What’s your name, boy?” END
BEGIN NOW “Tim.” Sawyer said. END
BEGIN NOW “well, Tim.  END
BEGIN NOW Cheers.” the three men clinked bottles together. END
BEGIN NOW “Cheers,” the other two said.  END
BEGIN NOW It seemed an odd sentiment given the circumstances. END
BEGIN NOW “Hey you hungry? we got some sandwich making supplies still.  END
BEGIN NOW Enough to last us a while.  END
BEGIN NOW Certainly more than we can eat before it starts to rot.  END
BEGIN NOW Help yourself.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thanks again.” Sawyer says finding the bag of sandwich rolls. END
BEGIN NOW “So what brings you to the new american dream, Tim?” END
BEGIN NOW “Oh you know, nothing else to do.” END
BEGIN NOW “Pfft, plenty to do if you got the willpower.  END
BEGIN NOW We’re just waiting for this whole mess to blow over.  END
BEGIN NOW Reminds of another time we saw this kind of thing go down.  END
BEGIN NOW Back in Berkeley in ‘09.  END
BEGIN NOW Something of an uprising.  END
BEGIN NOW They squashed that one pretty fast though.  END
BEGIN NOW Buncha’ bums trying to take over the town.” END
BEGIN NOW “hoo, i remember that one.  END
BEGIN NOW we almost made it too.  END
BEGIN NOW lacked public support.  END
BEGIN NOW that was our problem.  END
BEGIN NOW this time the public was all up in arms.  END
BEGIN NOW didn’t take them long to start fires and yanking the politicians out of their home.  END
BEGIN NOW It was like the french revolution happening all over the country.  END
BEGIN NOW The counties that had guns were the first and bloodiest.” END
BEGIN NOW “Jesus,” Sawyer said drooling at his ham sandwich.  END
BEGIN NOW He started eating it greedily.  END
BEGIN NOW “what a mess.” END
BEGIN NOW “you can say that.” END
BEGIN NOW “As big a mess as we’ve ever seen.  END
BEGIN NOW Wonder how the rest of the world is going on.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet it’s just as bad everywhere.” END
BEGIN NOW “who knows.  END
BEGIN NOW who cares.  END
BEGIN NOW ain’t my problem or yours.  END
BEGIN NOW i’m more concerned with our dwindling beer supply.” END
BEGIN NOW “There’ll be more beers.  END
BEGIN NOW There has to be.” END
BEGIN NOW “I suppose you’re right.” END
BEGIN NOW “Know any places around here that have some cigarettes?” Sawyer asked in between chews. END
BEGIN NOW “There might be.  END
BEGIN NOW They did a number on all the corner shops when the looting began.” END
BEGIN NOW “i know a place a few blocks from here.  END
BEGIN NOW They got everything in the front, but the store room is mostly intact.” END
BEGIN NOW “Gotta keep a supply of the essentials.” END
BEGIN NOW “cheers to that!” the two guys clinked bottles and set them down with an empty thud. END
BEGIN NOW “I suppose it’s about time to find another case of beer too.  END
BEGIN NOW We’ll have a couple more cold ones waiting for us upon return.” END
BEGIN NOW “yeah, i guess you’re right.” END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer finished his sandwich and drank his beer.  END
BEGIN NOW “You guys mind if i tag along? We’d be safer as a group.” END
BEGIN NOW “You think so? I suppose you’re right.  END
BEGIN NOW Makes a kind of sense.  END
BEGIN NOW Not a lot of that going around any more.” END
BEGIN NOW “mhmm.  END
BEGIN NOW let’s get going.  END
BEGIN NOW I want to get back here before dark.” END
BEGIN NOW The three guys picked up their packs and started walking.  END
BEGIN NOW The smouldering wreckage was smoking in the early dim of dusk.  END
BEGIN NOW Stray dogs and cats chased each other on the streets.  END
BEGIN NOW Some of the buildings had faces looking out at them, watching wide eyed with fear, unblinking and watchful.  END
BEGIN NOW Huddled and hoping the three guys didn’t turn and try to loot or kill. END
BEGIN NOW “jesus, what became of this place.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t had a smiling face in days.  END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but fear.  END
BEGIN NOW all the cops have moved on from this place.  END
BEGIN NOW I bet they’re over at the capital, waiting for someone to be in charge.  END
BEGIN NOW waiting for marching orders.” END
BEGIN NOW He wasn’t wrong.  END
BEGIN NOW The capitals across the country were surrounded by mobs of people camping out.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone was waiting for a leader.  END
BEGIN NOW Everyone was getting restless.  END
BEGIN NOW The energy that fueled the revolution was dying off and most people were returning to their homes, trying to figure out what to do next.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest, the politically minded, the ones that believed in a system of functioning government, camped out, looking for guidance on the next move.  END
BEGIN NOW in situations where people are looking for a leader, it’s assured that someone, usually severally people, will think they know what’s best for everyone.  END
BEGIN NOW And so it was that all across the country, small governments reformed.  END
BEGIN NOW Systems were established.  END
BEGIN NOW the old city halls and courtrooms were filled again.  END
BEGIN NOW And clean up began.  END
BEGIN NOW one by one, the basic functions were restored and the people did what they could to restore life to the way it was.  END
BEGIN NOW The armed forces had all congregated in washington D.C.  END
BEGIN NOW slowly taking back the city from the revolutionaries.  END
BEGIN NOW It didn’t take too long for even the most loyal recruit to figure out that the old ways were gone.  END
BEGIN NOW That the people in charge were promising paychecks from banks that no longer existed.  END
BEGIN NOW It didn’t take long for them to take their issued rifles and go find a shelter or a plot of land and call it their own. END
BEGIN NOW In his bunker, Mr. President and Thompson were drinking the last store of the liquor.  END
BEGIN NOW They were both getting sick from liver poisoning and malnutrition.  END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the officials had long since departed to the surface, some to die, some to surrender. END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, i’d like to propose a toast, to you for your loyalty in these troubling times.” END
BEGIN NOW “Thank you, sir.  END
BEGIN NOW Means the world to me.” END
BEGIN NOW They touched glasses and drank the brown liquor down easily.  END
BEGIN NOW having long sensed become numb and accustomed to the taste and smell of their liquid diet. END
BEGIN NOW “You’re much more than an aide and advisor.  END
BEGIN NOW I feel privileged to call you friend.” END
BEGIN NOW “Really, sir.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s too much.” the alcohol haze brought tears to their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Thompson, i feel a powerful sleep approaching.  END
BEGIN NOW I am a very tired man.” END
BEGIN NOW “Yes, sir.” Thompson was tired too.  END
BEGIN NOW He felt it wasn’t appropriate to admit this to the most powerful man in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to be tough until the end. END
BEGIN NOW “I..  END
BEGIN NOW think… i’m just gonna..  END
BEGIN NOW lay down for a bit.” END
BEGIN NOW “As you wish, sir.” Thompson refilled his glass and drank it down, no longer feeling the burn, not really feeling anything except an empty splash in his guts. END
BEGIN NOW The president slumped off his chair and landed on the rug, soiled with spills and ashes.  END
BEGIN NOW Mr. President curled into the fetal position and began snoring loudly.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson walked over to the flag hanging proudly from the pole.  END
BEGIN NOW With great reverence of a high priest, he took the flag down.  END
BEGIN NOW He walked over to the president humming the national anthem.  END
BEGIN NOW With the greatest care he draped the flag over the president’s sleeping body.  END
BEGIN NOW Thompson sat back down in his chair in front of the presidential desk.  END
BEGIN NOW He poured himself a long drink.  END
BEGIN NOW and polished off the bottle.  END
BEGIN NOW He took a long look at the great seal of the United States.  END
BEGIN NOW He looked at the majesty of the Eagle.  END
BEGIN NOW He was feeling sick and a little dizzy.  END
BEGIN NOW The room was gearing up to spin around him.  END
BEGIN NOW He put the glass to his lips and looked down at the sleeping, snoring figure of the most powerful man in the world.  END
BEGIN NOW He closed his eyes and tilted his head back, taking the last gulp of brown liquor, letting it hit him in his rapidly deteriorating guts.  END
BEGIN NOW He put the glass down on the desk, stiffened his back and gave a salute.  END
BEGIN NOW God Bless America. END
BEGIN NOW The END. END
BEGIN NOW Author’s final note.  END
BEGIN NOW Epilogue. END
BEGIN NOW So, that’s it.  END
BEGIN NOW I made my goal with time to spare.  END
BEGIN NOW this may be a first for me.  END
BEGIN NOW And were i not lazy and skipped some days that i was perfectly capable of getting some writing done, or distracted by whatever, I probably could have doubled the word count.  END
BEGIN NOW Too many days were spent going, well, i hit 1666.  END
BEGIN NOW that’s over with.  END
BEGIN NOW Despite all of that, one thing did happen that I am happy about.  END
BEGIN NOW writing 5k today was a fairly painless experience.  END
BEGIN NOW It was actually, one of the easiest days i had writing this big ol’ blob of shit.  END
BEGIN NOW And if anything, that’s how it should be.  END
BEGIN NOW I had something of an ending in mind.  END
BEGIN NOW And I’m pretty ok with how everything turned out.  END
BEGIN NOW Sawyer meets the bums.  END
BEGIN NOW Carter has disappeared.  END
BEGIN NOW The world is a mess and is trying to fix itself the only way it knows how.  END
BEGIN NOW With more violence and the same old tired politics.  END
BEGIN NOW It’s a pretty good nobody wins situation.  END
BEGIN NOW I haven’t read back through anything.  END
BEGIN NOW And i’m going to give it a few days before i do.  END
BEGIN NOW The idea of completion, in some sense, has been achieved.  END
BEGIN NOW I do feel that overall, I set out to do this and I did it.  END
BEGIN NOW and that was worth the whole month, The next step is to keep some momentum going.  END
BEGIN NOW to keep improving on writing.  END
BEGIN NOW to get better and re-learn how to actually tell a story that i want to tell.  END
BEGIN NOW Right now i’m tired.  END
BEGIN NOW my brain is operating on a few hours of sleep, my eyes are dry, my throat is dry.  END
BEGIN NOW my sense of humor is dry. END
BEGIN NOW I learned a lot of things this month.  END
BEGIN NOW i learned about the current state of hacking culture and the terrible state that our collective sense of security is in.  END
BEGIN NOW I learned that rushing into a writing project with zero prep and thought going into it except, “I want to write about the new cold war.” wasn’t the best idea.  END
BEGIN NOW And granted, if i took out all the asides and rabbit trails, i’d be hard pressed to hit 25k of actual content.  END
BEGIN NOW of that maybe 10% is probably salvageable.  END
BEGIN NOW But that’s too bad.  END
BEGIN NOW I’m going to keep writing some gibberish until the 12:00 hits.  END
BEGIN NOW Just to add some padding to this nonsense.  END
BEGIN NOW keep the old digits moving.  END
BEGIN NOW Or not.  END
BEGIN NOW I keep getting distracted.  END
BEGIN NOW I guess that’s going to be my new year’s resolution.  END
BEGIN NOW focus on what i’m trying to do.  END
BEGIN NOW And with that, I’m going to put a nail in this project and call it a night.  END
BEGIN NOW Pour myself a stiff drink and bid ye adieu. END
